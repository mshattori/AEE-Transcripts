<p>Hey, Aubrey, how's it going today? I'm great, Lindsay.</p>
<p>How are you? I have a question for you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, what are you up to later?</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>So what are you up to later? You know, it's a Monday.</p>
<p>What do you what are you doing later? I'm gonna plan dinner with my daughter Penelope.</p>
<p>She wants to help make dinner tonight I'm excited for when my kids can get to where they do it on their own But so far at least they'll help but it's all I need to be there with them.</p>
<p>Yeah, very social They like want to chat with me while we make dinner.</p>
<p>That's nice.</p>
<p>That sounds like some good mother-daughter time, right? That's nice I like that.</p>
<p>So you're you said you didn't say I'm going to right? I'm going to know you said I'm gonna I'm gonna I didn't even hear a G in that I'll break I know this came up in a recent episode When Lindsay said I'm gonna and pointed that out.</p>
<p>It's like I don't even say I'm gonna I just say I'm gonna yeah Yes, and there are so many chunks in American English where we do this We combine things to make pronunciation faster and easier So we promised a follow-up to dive into that and here you go today.</p>
<p>We're excited to share all of these.</p>
<p>I love it We are getting this is one of the</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>This is one of the most real English episodes that you're going to hear on All Ears English today, right? Because we're giving you the real true English, not the way we should say it or we want to say it.</p>
<p>It's what we actually say.</p>
<p>Yeah, none of this is in a textbook.</p>
<p>No, absolutely not.</p>
<p>It's our textbook.</p>
<p>This is the master textbook.</p>
<p>Hit the follow button right here on All Ears English because we have a special style where we focus on human connection.</p>
<p>Connection, not perfection.</p>
<p>All right, hit that follow button now.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right, let's dive into these.</p>
<p>We have five for you today and then a couple of little bonus phrases.</p>
<p>We use so many of these.</p>
<p>And first is just this, I'm gonna.</p>
<p>How else might we use this, Lindsey? I'm gonna, I'm gonna.</p>
<p>So yeah, here's an example.</p>
<p>I'm going to go shopping later.</p>
<p>Need me to pick anything up for you? Yeah, I'm going to go shopping later.</p>
<p>We run it all together.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go shopping.</p>
<p>It would take way too long to say I'm going to go shopping or even I'm done.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>go shopping or even I'm gonna to get to the G.</p>
<p>It's just too much work.</p>
<p>Yeah, the truth is we say what is easy to say because life moves quickly.</p>
<p>You need to get on to saying where you're going and what you're buying, right? Exactly.</p>
<p>Yes, Okay, let's go into this next one.</p>
<p>I say this a lot.</p>
<p>Our second one is I ought to, which means like I should, but we will say I oughta.</p>
<p>Do you say this? I oughta? I oughta? I don't say as much as I oughta.</p>
<p>Yeah, I say it sometimes.</p>
<p>Sometimes.</p>
<p>So I might say, you know, I oughta get ready.</p>
<p>We need to be there in an hour.</p>
<p>So it means I should.</p>
<p>I should get ready.</p>
<p>But I often, this might depend a little bit on regional dialect whether you'd say I should or I oughta.</p>
<p>So I ought to, which is spelled sort of strange ought, O-U-G-H-T.</p>
<p>Hopefully you have this transcript so you can see this weird spelling of this verb.</p>
<p>It's similar spelling to thought, right? The word thought.</p>
<p>I thought or sought.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>I thought, or sought, right? Seek, sought, sought, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Next one, Aubrey, would be, I have to, is not I have to, it's I hafta.</p>
<p>I hafta.</p>
<p>I have to call my mom about something, right? Yes, I have to call my mom later.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And just to slow that down and say, I have to, I have to call my mom, is, I mean, we just never do it because it takes so much more time.</p>
<p>And this is for casual conversations, but even formal conversations at work, this is usually what you're going to hear instead, because it just takes so much more time to, you know, enunciate these individual sounds.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>And then number four, I needa.</p>
<p>I need to.</p>
<p>I needa.</p>
<p>I need a snack.</p>
<p>Oh, so you're saying, so I need to eat a snack or I need a snack? So this is both, both ways, right? So I need to, like, I need to go to the store later, would do it there, right? If it's I need to.</p>
<p>And then of course, just like, I need a snack, we run needa.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>We run Needa.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>I need a snack.</p>
<p>But the one we're really focusing on here, I need to get a snack, right? I need to get in the car later.</p>
<p>Yes, Or get a snack.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So, number five, should have, would have, or could have, they all become what? Yeah.</p>
<p>We combine these two, shoulda, woulda, and coulda, which is actually an idiom to say shoulda, woulda, coulda.</p>
<p>What does that mean, Lindsay? That's a great one.</p>
<p>I say that all the time.</p>
<p>It's just when you're kind of like a Monday morning quarterback thing, right? The game was on Sunday.</p>
<p>You really should have done this.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Shoulda, woulda, coulda.</p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p>Hindsight is 20-20.</p>
<p>Yes, We say it a lot.</p>
<p>If someone tells us what we should have done differently, then we'll be like, eh, shoulda, woulda, coulda.</p>
<p>It means sort of the same when we say hindsight is 20-20.</p>
<p>Yes, Like, okay, well, if I could go back, maybe I would do something differently.</p>
<p>Ah, regrets.</p>
<p>Regrets.</p>
<p>Right? We all have regrets.</p>
<p>It's better not to...</p>
<p>It's part of the human experience.</p>
<p>It's better not to kind of rest on that.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>Yeah, best not to kind of rest on them and think about it too much.</p>
<p>Yes, but we never say should have or, you know, should have, especially.</p>
<p>No, true.</p>
<p>We say shoulda.</p>
<p>I shoulda started this project earlier.</p>
<p>You know, if so, I would have finished on time.</p>
<p>Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>I shoulda.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>And any others, Aubrey, before we go to a quick break, anything else we need to know? Yes, Well, we want to share that a lot of these, when we say them in the negative, we also run them together, but then you need the nuh, right? So for example, instead of saying, I shouldn't have eaten so much, I'm so full, would say, I shouldn't have eaten so much and we're just cramming it all together and dropping so many sounds.</p>
<p>Yes, That's the worst feeling, isn't it? Yes, Walking out of a restaurant.</p>
<p>Oh God.</p>
<p>Do you see that? I overeat sometimes.</p>
<p>I've, I heard this really good strategy to, if a portion comes and it's too big to ask for a box right away and put half of it in the box before you even start eating.</p>
<p>Like that would help me.</p>
<p>No, that's good.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>No, that's good.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>I know it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I used to do it more than I do now.</p>
<p>But for sure, I think in Japan, they have this idea of the 80% full, like eat until you're 80% full, which is a good rule of thumb, too, I think.</p>
<p>Yes, Or just eat more slowly.</p>
<p>You know, if I'm slow and chatting, then you feel full so much quicker.</p>
<p>Otherwise...</p>
<p>It's true.</p>
<p>Because sometimes your brain doesn't register that you're already full.</p>
<p>It's so true.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>Yes, So many good tips here on not overheating.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>So many good American tips here, not overeating, because we have huge portions of restaurants in the States.</p>
<p>We have huge portions.</p>
<p>Yes, And also pronunciation.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Double threat.</p>
<p>Okay, Aubrey, we are back from break.</p>
<p>Let's bring this into a real conversation, and we'll really see how it's done.</p>
<p>All right? Awesome.</p>
<p>So you and I are at an airport here.</p>
<p>We're in line to go through security before a flight.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Oh, stressful.</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>Your turn.</p>
<p>I should have got...</p>
<p>Okay, I'll go first.</p>
<p>I'm going to have a hard time.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>here earlier.</p>
<p>I'm going to have a hard time making it to the gate in time.</p>
<p>Same.</p>
<p>This has happened to me a couple of times this year.</p>
<p>I need a plan to be at the airport much earlier.</p>
<p>I need to grab a snack and fill my water too, but I might not have time.</p>
<p>We ought to have time, I think.</p>
<p>Hope so.</p>
<p>It'll depend on how fast this line goes.</p>
<p>Oh, that's especially stressful when you're running late and there's a long line at security.</p>
<p>Has that happened to you, Lindsay? Well, just last Sunday, my plane out of Italy was delayed by two hours.</p>
<p>As we were boarding the plane in Venice, my plane in Munich was boarding.</p>
<p>And so somehow, we made it.</p>
<p>I have no idea how we made it, but we made it.</p>
<p>We arrived.</p>
<p>There was also a bus in the hangar, so you get off bussing you.</p>
<p>I've never run so fast.</p>
<p>I thought my heart was going to explode.</p>
<p>There was no one in front of us in Munich.</p>
<p>We went right through and made the plane.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>the plane.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm glad you made it.</p>
<p>That is so stressful.</p>
<p>This has happened to me a few times.</p>
<p>I'm stuck in security and I'm really debating like, should I ask the people in front of me to let me cut in line, to like let me go up because they might have two hours before their flight.</p>
<p>Sometimes you get there early and you're waiting at the gate forever.</p>
<p>I've had people ask to pass me and if I have lots of time, I'm like, yes, yes, you go.</p>
<p>I don't want you to miss your flight.</p>
<p>I think it's reasonable.</p>
<p>I think it's reasonable because everyone's been there or they will be one day if they fly enough.</p>
<p>And you know, it's really, you don't want to lose all that money if you just don't make it and they don't always refund you.</p>
<p>You know, I know, I know.</p>
<p>It's interesting when you talk about line cutting, just as a little side note, it's interesting how like if someone does it out of turn, like without asking or when they shouldn't people get so upset.</p>
<p>But if there is a reason and it's justified and they ask and they're polite, usually nobody minds.</p>
<p>They're like, yes, go, go, go.</p>
<p>Right, So it's so interesting how it all depends on how you ask, how you frame it, what reactions</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>frame it, what reactions you're going to get.</p>
<p>And it's true.</p>
<p>And that may be global.</p>
<p>That may also be more American.</p>
<p>I'm not sure.</p>
<p>But definitely like they'll get on your side and they'll be rooting for you.</p>
<p>Did you make it? Come on, go, go, go, you know? Right, Whereas imagine if they're just shoving past you without even saying why or explaining, everyone would be angry.</p>
<p>The key is you have to communicate.</p>
<p>Actually, Aubrey, that would be a great episode topic that we should do.</p>
<p>Raises for communicating when you need to cut in line.</p>
<p>I love that idea.</p>
<p>Or something on airport communication.</p>
<p>There's a lot we could do there.</p>
<p>I think we'll be coming out of that later this year, guys.</p>
<p>So hit that follow button.</p>
<p>Okay, let's go through what we did here, Aubrey, with our pronunciation.</p>
<p>Take us through.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I first said I should have gotten here earlier.</p>
<p>So of course, I'm saying I should have arrived.</p>
<p>But instead, I say I should have gotten.</p>
<p>Not even should have or should have.</p>
<p>I'm saying shoulda.</p>
<p>Shoulda gotten.</p>
<p>Just think about how much longer it takes to say I should have gotten here.</p>
<p>I have to bring my lips down to touch my bottom lip.</p>
<p>My top teeth touch my bottom lip for the v sound.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>my bottom lip for the V sound, then go up to G.</p>
<p>It takes too long.</p>
<p>I should have gotten, it all takes place in the top of my mouth if I stay instead of going to V, right? Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>When we're helping students improve their pronunciation and we're helping them pronounce that V, the V sound, yeah, it takes some time to put the teeth and vibrate sound on your bottom lip.</p>
<p>So that's when we're speaking fast, we drop that entirely.</p>
<p>Yeah, we don't even have to.</p>
<p>It's so much easier.</p>
<p>It's like a little option for cheating here.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And then we say, I'm gonna, I'm gonna have a hard time making it to the gate in time.</p>
<p>So what am I actually saying? We drop that hard G.</p>
<p>We're really saying, I'm going to have a hard time, or at least I'm gonna, I'm gonna have a hard time, but often we drop the G and go straight from, we're linking here.</p>
<p>We say, I'm gonna.</p>
<p>I'm gonna have a hard time.</p>
<p>It sounds so natural.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then I said, I need a plan to be at the airport earlier.</p>
<p>So I'm trying to say, I need to plan.</p>
<p>Yes, I need to plan better next time.</p>
<p>Instead we say, I need a plan.</p>
<p>And I want to point out, I noticed as you were reading this, Lindsay, a phrase here when you said, this has happened to me a couple of times this year, you ran that together too.</p>
<p>You said, this has happened to me a couple of times, coupla.</p>
<p>So instead of we drop the F at the end of of here, and instead we say coupla, coupla times.</p>
<p>Yes, I love that one too.</p>
<p>And then I need a came back again.</p>
<p>You said, I need to grab a snack.</p>
<p>I need to grab a snack.</p>
<p>And then you said, we ought to have time.</p>
<p>So instead of we ought to, which means the same as we should, we should have time.</p>
<p>I think they're totally interchangeable, but if you're going to say ought to, you're probably going to say, oughta.</p>
<p>We ought to have time.</p>
<p>That's the one that I feel is just a little less frequent in my personal vocabulary, and it's more informal.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>common.</p>
<p>And it's more informal, I feel like, as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, for me, it feels a little older.</p>
<p>It feels a little more old fashioned, but that just could be my bias.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>It was very common in my regional dialect growing up.</p>
<p>I feel like I do still hear it a lot, but not as much like on the news or on podcasts when people are trying to uplevel their English a little.</p>
<p>I think this feels more informal, even to a lot of Americans, and so you won't hear it as often.</p>
<p>Okay, love it.</p>
<p>Do we have another episode that our listeners should go to and check out today? Yes, Well, this is a video on our YouTube channel that was really helpful, especially if you're studying for IELTS.</p>
<p>Jessica and I talked about do WANA and GUNA help your IELTS speaking score.</p>
<p>So if you especially if you're studying for IELTS, like can you use WANA and GUNA, there's some really good tips there.</p>
<p>So you want to go find that on our blog.</p>
<p>But as a quick little hint, right, because I can imagine you guys are like, what? What is it? Can I use? They're great for</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>What is it? Can I use? They're great for informal speaking, but you would never want to use them on writing.</p>
<p>Way too informal.</p>
<p>Yes, Oh, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>We would never...</p>
<p>On the IELTS exam, for example.</p>
<p>No, right? Even in regular writing.</p>
<p>It's so rare that we'll write wanna or gonna as like W-A-N-N-A.</p>
<p>Even in most emails, I'll still write out want to.</p>
<p>Yes, 100%.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>So guys, we're sending you over today to our YouTube channel called IELTS Energy TV.</p>
<p>If you're taking IELTS anytime soon, or even if you're not taking IELTS and you want to learn more about wanna and gonna, go and find that video.</p>
<p>All right? Absolutely.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>This was really fun.</p>
<p>I'm excited for you guys.</p>
<p>I know a lot of you want to speak more like Americans, like with this accent we use.</p>
<p>This does depend where you live, right? It's different in different accents.</p>
<p>This is very much American English.</p>
<p>We speak very quickly.</p>
<p>We're trying to save time.</p>
<p>These phrases are great.</p>
<p>Yes, good stuff.</p>
<p>So give them a try, guys.</p>
<p>Don't be shy.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>Give them a try, guys.</p>
<p>Don't be shy.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid to try it out.</p>
<p>That's how we get there.</p>
<p>That's how we get comfortable with something is by actually just experimenting with it.</p>
<p>OK? Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yes, try all of these.</p>
<p>These trunks are such a great way to connect with others, too, especially if it's just informal daily conversations.</p>
<p>You don't want to waste their time.</p>
<p>You want to speed up your English when you can.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>All right, Aubrey, well, I'll talk to you very soon.</p>
<p>Have a good week.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>You too.</p>
<p>Take care.</p>
