<p id="p-16">Thanks.</p>
<p id="p-17">You've done some traveling recently.</p>
<p id="p-18">Have you ever had anything preposterous happen to you while traveling? Preposterous.</p>
<p id="p-19">Wow.</p>
<p id="p-20">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-21">I mean, well, let's see.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-22">Well, let's see.</p>
<p id="p-23">I had my camera stolen once in Argentina.</p>
<p id="p-24">But you know, I it's okay.</p>
<p id="p-25">I'm over it.</p>
<p id="p-26">So yeah, yeah, no.</p>
<p id="p-27">Basically, I've had some I've had a lot of luck while traveling.</p>
<p id="p-28">I've had, you know, I'm pretty nimble.</p>
<p id="p-29">I like to just watch for watch my things and just be careful on the street.</p>
<p id="p-30">But like, geez, a lot of places are just so pleasant and wonderful to travel in.</p>
<p id="p-31">So I've been lucky.</p>
<p id="p-32">I've been lucky.</p>
<p id="p-33">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-34">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-35">Good.</p>
<p id="p-36">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-37">I also, as you know, I was pickpocketed as well.</p>
<p id="p-38">So I had Amsterdam, right? Yep.</p>
<p id="p-39">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-40">We have talked about that a lot.</p>
<p id="p-41">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-42">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-43">Amsterdam.</p>
<p id="p-44">Well, so that was kind of preposterous.</p>
<p id="p-45">But today, we're going to answer a listener's question about this word.</p>
<p id="p-46">So this is a really good specific question, which we love.</p>
<p id="p-47">But before we get into it, we wanted to share some results of a recent poll that we</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-48">a recent poll that we did on Spotify.</p>
<p id="p-49">So this was for episode 2261.</p>
<p id="p-50">If you didn't listen yet, head on over and listen to that after this episode.</p>
<p id="p-51">So that was, in my former life, how to share who you used to be in English.</p>
<p id="p-52">So Lindsey, what was the poll for this? I love this poll.</p>
<p id="p-53">We had fun.</p>
<p id="p-54">So fun.</p>
<p id="p-55">We said, what do you feel when you look at pictures of yourself from 20 years ago? And I'm gonna share the results now.</p>
<p id="p-56">I know what I would vote, but here's what our listeners voted.</p>
<p id="p-57">I look totally different was 50% of you.</p>
<p id="p-58">So that's interesting.</p>
<p id="p-59">I mean, 20 years is a long time.</p>
<p id="p-60">So it does make sense.</p>
<p id="p-61">Or I look about the same, 30%.</p>
<p id="p-62">People are aging well, like that too.</p>
<p id="p-63">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-64">Or the one I would have said, because I don't understand how you can't think this, right? Cringe, what was going on with my hair slash fashion slash shoe choices, right? I just don't even understand how to not think that because</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-65">even understand how to not think that because, I don't know, I'm not even a big fashion person.</p>
<p id="p-66">I don't follow trends.</p>
<p id="p-67">But when I look at old photos, I think, why did I think I should wear that? What was I doing? Right, right, right.</p>
<p id="p-68">Oh, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-69">It's hard to not think that for sure.</p>
<p id="p-70">So I'm sure.</p>
<p id="p-71">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-72">Well, it looks like 20% of our listeners agree with you.</p>
<p id="p-73">Yeah, it's so funny.</p>
<p id="p-74">Yeah, we love these polls.</p>
<p id="p-75">Guys, remember, you need to be in Spotify to participate in these polls.</p>
<p id="p-76">But come on over and make your voice heard so we can get to know each other as a community.</p>
<p id="p-77">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-78">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-79">All right.</p>
<p id="p-80">So, Lindsay, today we have a question, as I said, from Fereshteh.</p>
<p id="p-81">And would you like to read it? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-82">So Fereshteh says, Hi, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-83">Hope you're doing well.</p>
<p id="p-84">Thanks a lot for all of your time and efforts on All Ears English.</p>
<p id="p-85">I wondered if the word preposterous is a suitable word to use in daily conversations about a silly thing, or it might be rude to use.</p>
<p id="p-86">Thanks.</p>
<p id="p-87">Sincerely, Fereshteh.</p>
<p id="p-88">Love that.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-89">I love that this listener is thinking, is something rude? Is something polite? Is it too silly? Is the tone correct? Right, Right, No, I mean, that's huge.</p>
<p id="p-90">Right, It's one thing to just know what the word means, but you have to know the context behind it.</p>
<p id="p-91">And that's so much of what this podcast is about, in my opinion.</p>
<p id="p-92">Yes, So.</p>
<p id="p-93">All right.</p>
<p id="p-94">Well, let's get into it.</p>
<p id="p-95">Lindsay, what does preposterous mean? Basically.</p>
<p id="p-96">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-97">Basically, it's a negative word.</p>
<p id="p-98">It means ridiculous.</p>
<p id="p-99">And so we're going to get into it a bit more and kind of define what situations it would work for.</p>
<p id="p-100">It's definitely, like I said, it's a negative thing.</p>
<p id="p-101">But Forestia is asking if it's okay to use it in daily conversations about something that's silly.</p>
<p id="p-102">I don't know, Michelle, you let me know what you think here.</p>
<p id="p-103">Well, I think it's like anything.</p>
<p id="p-104">It depends on your tone of voice.</p>
<p id="p-105">It depends on the context.</p>
<p id="p-106">So what we're going to do to help answer this is give you lots of examples, right?</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-107">give you lots of examples, right? So, and we'll talk it through, but it is a very extreme sounding word.</p>
<p id="p-108">It is also kind of a funny sounding word.</p>
<p id="p-109">To me, it's almost a little fun to say, like I love the word perturbed because I think it's a fun word to say, in my opinion, and also preposterous.</p>
<p id="p-110">It's also, you almost feel the word in the way it comes out.</p>
<p id="p-111">Does that make sense? Yeah, completely.</p>
<p id="p-112">I also, it makes me think of, I don't know if this was Princess Diary or something, that when one of the famous actor, he goes, "'Inconceivable.'" That's the Princess Bride.</p>
<p id="p-113">Oh, Princess Bride, I always get the two confused.</p>
<p id="p-114">Yes, But that kind of falls into this category of it's really about how you deliver it.</p>
<p id="p-115">And so my example at the top of the show about having my camera stolen wasn't the best.</p>
<p id="p-116">And so it's delivery, it's kind of more about who's saying it and what situation you're describing it.</p>
<p id="p-117">Right, Describing.</p>
<p id="p-118">Right, right, right.</p>
<p id="p-119">So, I mean.</p>
<p id="p-120">Inconceivable.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-121">Right, right.</p>
<p id="p-122">Inconceivable.</p>
<p id="p-123">Inconceivable, yes.</p>
<p id="p-124">That's a very famous one, guys.</p>
<p id="p-125">If you haven't seen The Princess Bride, you should definitely check it out.</p>
<p id="p-126">So you could use this word, in my opinion, you could use it about something silly in a humorous way, kind of like inconceivable.</p>
<p id="p-127">So, for example, you could be using it to kind of be a little bit of a teasing in a way, or for self-deprecating humor, or even in a good way.</p>
<p id="p-128">So we're going to do a follow-up on that topic.</p>
<p id="p-129">I have some ideas in mind about words that are negative but are used in a good way.</p>
<p id="p-130">So definitely hit follow on this podcast.</p>
<p id="p-131">But let's give some examples.</p>
<p id="p-132">Let's see, what's the first one? All right.</p>
<p id="p-133">So talking about your outfit, is that where we're at here in our notes, Michelle? Yes, All right.</p>
<p id="p-134">I know my outfit is preposterous, isn't it?</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-135">preposterous, isn't it? I can't believe I got red wine all over it.</p>
<p id="p-136">So what am I saying here? I'm saying I wore the wrong color, knowing I was going to drink red wine.</p>
<p id="p-137">Is that what I'm saying? Well, I think, I mean, it could be that, but it could also just be the way I was thinking of it as like, maybe you got red wine all over it and then you have to go around the room and you're kind of acknowledging, oh yeah, I know it's preposterous.</p>
<p id="p-138">Look at this.</p>
<p id="p-139">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-140">When I think about this word, uh, it's a little bit, it feels like stage language kind of.</p>
<p id="p-141">It feels like something that would be written into a play more for me more than like in a daily conversation.</p>
<p id="p-142">It has to be, I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-143">There's some larger than theatrical.</p>
<p id="p-144">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-145">It's a little larger than life.</p>
<p id="p-146">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-147">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-148">Um, I agree with you.</p>
<p id="p-149">You're, you're not using it about just anything.</p>
<p id="p-150">So it would have to be, there's red wine over here out</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-151">over here outfit.</p>
<p id="p-152">This is preposterous.</p>
<p id="p-153">You know, it's, it's not used.</p>
<p id="p-154">I mean, it can be used casually, but just for about something big.</p>
<p id="p-155">Um, so, or, or coming from a big personality where you really want to over-exaggerate or maybe you've had a little too much red wine and you're just, you're, you think everyone's listening to you.</p>
<p id="p-156">It's preposterous that I have red wine on my shirt.</p>
<p id="p-157">I could say, okay, see, I could know what I mean.</p>
<p id="p-158">Yeah, right.</p>
<p id="p-159">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-160">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-161">Or maybe you're kind of trash talking with somebody about, you're going to play a game with them and they, they're saying, oh, I'm going to beat you.</p>
<p id="p-162">You might say, ah, that's preposterous.</p>
<p id="p-163">Of course I'm the one who will beat you.</p>
<p id="p-164">Right? See, it's a little theatrical.</p>
<p id="p-165">It's a little bit, there's a little bit of, um, kind of what's the word like positioning here.</p>
<p id="p-166">There's a little positioning, there's a delivery.</p>
<p id="p-167">So I will say it's not really in my day-to-day language, this word, something that I use, cause I don't tend</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-168">word, something that I use, because I don't tend to, I'm not very theatrical, but a lot of people are.</p>
<p id="p-169">And if that's your personality, I love this as an option, you know? Right, right.</p>
<p id="p-170">So, I mean, you can use it in a playful way, I think, because it has that funny over-the-top, theatrical sound.</p>
<p id="p-171">So, but the question is, is it rude? So, in my opinion, not if used in that way.</p>
<p id="p-172">If you're being serious and using that word, which we're going to talk about now, how it's used in a more serious way, it may be offensive.</p>
<p id="p-173">So, but sometimes you do need to be direct.</p>
<p id="p-174">So, Lindsay, you already mentioned, you know, this isn't really in your vocabulary so much.</p>
<p id="p-175">I don't know that it's in mine that much either.</p>
<p id="p-176">Again, it's not, this is not a word that you're going to use every day.</p>
<p id="p-177">You know, I'm also thinking about, actually, maybe let's talk about this after.</p>
<p id="p-178">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-179">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-180">After the break.</p>
<p id="p-181">All right, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-182">So, we are back.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-183">All right, Michelle, so we are back.</p>
<p id="p-184">And I like that you brought it back to the original question, right? Is it rude? And so it's a lot about the context here and what exactly are you saying and who are you saying it to? Are you being, again, theatrical and kind of being a bit more exaggerated and character-like or are you being direct? And we're gonna look at more serious examples now, yes.</p>
<p id="p-185">Right, so in the more serious way that it might be used, this actually, the way that I've been seeing it a lot is in interviews on the news, especially with the election coming up.</p>
<p id="p-186">You might hear somebody say, oh, you know, Trump said this, Harris said this, or something, and then somebody might comment, oh, well, I think that's just preposterous, right? Yeah, yeah, I think so.</p>
<p id="p-187">I would say it's less likely that the actual, like we had the debate last night, right? As we're recording this, we're in September, there was a big presidential debate.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-188">In September, there was a big presidential debate and it less likely to hear it from the candidates because it takes longer to say it.</p>
<p id="p-189">You kind of have to get, I don't know, you have to be a little more dramatic to say that, but from a commentator where their job literally, and by the way, these days, CNN is very heavy on talking heads and commentators, which when we were in Slovenia, side point, there was actual news on CNN.</p>
<p id="p-190">Oh yeah.</p>
<p id="p-191">Like there was investigative journalism.</p>
<p id="p-192">There was, it was a much more global perspective.</p>
<p id="p-193">The contrast was so different, Michelle, I couldn't believe it.</p>
<p id="p-194">And I think CNN has kind of become a bit more entertaining and you have the talking heads and kind of debating with each other and I miss the actual news.</p>
<p id="p-195">I know.</p>
<p id="p-196">And it's hard to know.</p>
<p id="p-197">And it's almost, it feels like there's nowhere to turn for actual news.</p>
<p id="p-198">It's like, you know, any most, I mean, unless you watch the local news, which isn't really going to give you that information about the election or things like that.</p>
<p id="p-199">It's hard to find a news source that is, yeah, that's.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-200">that is, honestly, I really think it seems like most of them are just very biased.</p>
<p id="p-201">Things have changed a lot.</p>
<p id="p-202">Anyway, side point, maybe that's another episode.</p>
<p id="p-203">But when you travel abroad, you notice certain things.</p>
<p id="p-204">CNN International.</p>
<p id="p-205">CNN International, how different it is, and just a more global perspective, which I am jealous to not be able to be exposed to that.</p>
<p id="p-206">So anyways, okay, moving on.</p>
<p id="p-207">So, all right, but let's give, here.</p>
<p id="p-208">So as I said, something like this.</p>
<p id="p-209">Your argument here is preposterous.</p>
<p id="p-210">You have nothing to back up your claims.</p>
<p id="p-211">So I started to say that in a very dramatic way because it does feel very dramatic.</p>
<p id="p-212">Right, and just the way you delivered the word with your intonation, Michelle, preposterous.</p>
<p id="p-213">I could see you on stage right now, even though this is a more serious example.</p>
<p id="p-214">So maybe a lawyer maybe could say that in a courtroom.</p>
<p id="p-215">Yep, right, prosecutor, defense attorney, maybe who knows.</p>
<p id="p-216">Here's another one.</p>
<p id="p-217">This line is.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-218">another one.</p>
<p id="p-219">This line is preposterous.</p>
<p id="p-220">When will they get more people to start working at the register? Right? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-221">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-222">Um, you know, have you ever been on one of those lines at the grocery store or something and you're just looking around and there's no one else? Yeah, totally.</p>
<p id="p-223">You could say, Oh my God, this is preposterous.</p>
<p id="p-224">But again, very dramatic.</p>
<p id="p-225">So dramatic.</p>
<p id="p-226">It's dramatic.</p>
<p id="p-227">It's dramatic.</p>
<p id="p-228">Make that decision.</p>
<p id="p-229">Yeah, that's a good way to describe it.</p>
<p id="p-230">Uh, and then there are some other things we might say.</p>
<p id="p-231">The tone might be slightly different, like laughable.</p>
<p id="p-232">This is a pretty good match though.</p>
<p id="p-233">It's laughable that you think I might actually consider doing a five mile run in the rain.</p>
<p id="p-234">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-235">Cause I'm like, I know I'm going to the movies, you know? Right, right, right.</p>
<p id="p-236">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-237">So these don't necessarily, all of these don't, it's not a one for one match necessarily, but they're pretty close.</p>
<p id="p-238">Um, but yeah, laughable or illogical.</p>
<p id="p-239">So this is the one that is pretty different.</p>
<p id="p-240">I mean, but still could be.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-241">different.</p>
<p id="p-242">I mean, but still could be used in the same idea.</p>
<p id="p-243">That statement is illogical, right? It doesn't make sense.</p>
<p id="p-244">So you could say it's based on your feeling and we only work on facts.</p>
<p id="p-245">Yeah, or ridiculous.</p>
<p id="p-246">Ridiculous would be the more common one that you might hear more often, right? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-247">The prices at that restaurant are ridiculous.</p>
<p id="p-248">Let's go somewhere else.</p>
<p id="p-249">Yes, Right, Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-250">All right.</p>
<p id="p-251">Good.</p>
<p id="p-252">So do you have any that are your favorite, Lindsay? What would you be most likely to be? I would say ridiculous.</p>
<p id="p-253">I also say, I say insane a lot.</p>
<p id="p-254">Like I say, I'll say those prices are insane.</p>
<p id="p-255">Like that's, that's honestly like where I go the most.</p>
<p id="p-256">We have done an episode on sometimes we might want to be careful with that term at times, but it's, you know, it's still in my vocabulary.</p>
<p id="p-257">Very common.</p>
<p id="p-258">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-259">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-260">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-261">I think I'd also be most likely to say ridiculous.</p>
<p id="p-262">All right.</p>
<p id="p-263">So should we do a role play before we head on out? Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-264">So we are friends and we're talking about our upcoming plans.</p>
<p id="p-265">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-266">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-267">So should we.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-268">Okay, so should we get to the party at 6? Lindsay, that's ridiculous.</p>
<p id="p-269">You know we have to be fashionably late.</p>
<p id="p-270">Fine, fine, but I don't want to leave during rush hour.</p>
<p id="p-271">That's just, that'd be just illogical.</p>
<p id="p-272">Okay, yeah, true.</p>
<p id="p-273">And the traffic was ridiculous at that time.</p>
<p id="p-274">Oop, used it again.</p>
<p id="p-275">Yeah, between the two of us, this whole party is preposterous.</p>
<p id="p-276">I don't even know why we're going.</p>
<p id="p-277">Oh, come on, let's be supportive.</p>
<p id="p-278">It reminds me.</p>
<p id="p-279">I forgot.</p>
<p id="p-280">Yeah, go ahead.</p>
<p id="p-281">I have a friend, she used to live in New York, and once we went to a party together, and it was like a New York party, cool people, you know, you're not supposed to show up on time.</p>
<p id="p-282">She insisted we show up like five minutes early, and you could tell the host was super annoyed with her.</p>
<p id="p-283">She's like getting out of the shower, she's like, why are you here? Oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-284">Everyone else came at 9, and we came at like 7.50, and I'm like, why are we doing this? Why are we here? That's really funny.</p>
<p id="p-285">Yep.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-286">That's really funny.</p>
<p id="p-287">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-288">That's that's funny.</p>
<p id="p-289">Um, so yeah, same idea.</p>
<p id="p-290">I forgot to use laughable.</p>
<p id="p-291">So sorry about that.</p>
<p id="p-292">But I use ridiculous twice.</p>
<p id="p-293">So there you go.</p>
<p id="p-294">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-295">So I said, Lindsay, that's ridiculous.</p>
<p id="p-296">You know, we have to be passionately late.</p>
<p id="p-297">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-298">And I think while using ridiculous twice is probably more on target for at least my vocabulary.</p>
<p id="p-299">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-300">But laughable is fun to it can be a bit of a backhanded insult for sure.</p>
<p id="p-301">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-302">Right, Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-303">And then you'd said, Oh, fine, fine.</p>
<p id="p-304">But I don't want to leave during rush hour.</p>
<p id="p-305">That had just be illogical.</p>
<p id="p-306">That'd just be illogical.</p>
<p id="p-307">That would just be a logic.</p>
<p id="p-308">Yes, Um, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-309">So yeah, I know.</p>
<p id="p-310">Um, and then I said, yeah, and traffic is ridiculous at that time.</p>
<p id="p-311">So yeah.</p>
<p id="p-312">And then I'm going to wonder word ridiculous at this time.</p>
<p id="p-313">And I'm going to wind up for this big meaty word, right? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-314">Between the two of us, this whole party is preposterous.</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p id="p-315">party is preposterous.</p>
<p id="p-316">You really have to punch that.</p>
<p id="p-317">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-318">Intonation wise.</p>
<p id="p-319">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-320">Don't you kind of? Yes, Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-321">Preposterous.</p>
<p id="p-322">You're not just you would never say like, oh, it's just preposterous.</p>
<p id="p-323">Right, Right, Just that's why I'm saying I don't love my example at the top of the show because I would have chosen a different word.</p>
<p id="p-324">Right, It's ridiculous that my camera got stolen.</p>
<p id="p-325">It's crazy.</p>
<p id="p-326">It's you know, I regret that I left it on the bed.</p>
<p id="p-327">But yeah, preposterous deserves being on stage this word in a sense.</p>
<p id="p-328">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-329">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-330">OK, Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-331">So very dramatic.</p>
<p id="p-332">But yeah, I think that's the that's the real takeaway for today is that this is a very dramatic word.</p>
<p id="p-333">It can be used in many different ways.</p>
<p id="p-334">There are more common words like ridiculous that are that you will hear more frequently.</p>
<p id="p-335">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-336">But this this one is a good one to use if you decide that it matches with the situation your personality type, whatever it may be.</p>
<p id="p-337">Totally.</p>
<p id="p-338">And I would say also consume Broadway.</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p id="p-339">also consume Broadway plays.</p>
<p id="p-340">If you can't go to Broadway, see if you can find the movies and get the same scripts.</p>
<p id="p-341">Go to Off-Broadway, watch the movies, read literature.</p>
<p id="p-342">You're going to see it more in more theatrical productions, I think.</p>
<p id="p-343">Or if it suits your personality, like Michelle said, go for it.</p>
<p id="p-344">But you got to wind up for it.</p>
<p id="p-345">You got to get ready and deliver it properly.</p>
<p id="p-346">Do some stretches before.</p>
<p id="p-347">Do some stretches, go to the gym, you know, bicep work.</p>
<p id="p-348">It's funny.</p>
<p id="p-349">All right, good stuff.</p>
<p id="p-350">We better hop off the mic, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-351">Thanks for being on today.</p>
<p id="p-352">All right.</p>
<p id="p-353">Thank you, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-354">Have a good one.</p>
<p id="p-355">All right.</p>
