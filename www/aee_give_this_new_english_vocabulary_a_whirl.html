<p id="p-14">How's it going today?</p>
<p id="p-15">Hey, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-16">Good.</p>
<p id="p-17">Lindsay, what's the most recent purchase you made?</p>
<p id="p-18">Oh my gosh, the most recent purchase I made, I just recently bought a Christmas gift for my partner and that was something.</p>
<p id="p-19">So yeah.</p>
<p id="p-20">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-21">So it's not something that you've tried yet, whatever.</p>
<p id="p-22">No, I had to order it and it's coming today, I think.</p>
<p id="p-23">Yeah, Yeah, Oh, okay.</p>
<p id="p-24">Well, that sounds exciting.</p>
<p id="p-25">So my parents got my son a basketball hoop for his birthday.</p>
<p id="p-26">He hasn't used it yet because it needs to be put together a little bit more, but I'm sure he's going to be excited to use it for the first time.</p>
<p id="p-27">Oh, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-28">Yeah, So today we have a great question from a listener.</p>
<p id="p-29">But before we get into that, we want to say thank you so much to those who...</p>

<p id="p-44">It is actually.</p>
<p id="p-45">Yes, from YouTube.</p>
<p id="p-46">Guys, if you aren't watching over on YouTube, and you</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-47">aren't watching over on YouTube, you and you want to see us here we are over on YouTube.</p>
<p id="p-48">I'm waving Hello.</p>
<p id="p-49">Yeah, So yeah, sometimes people submit their questions there.</p>
<p id="p-50">So that's really great.</p>
<p id="p-51">Let's see.</p>
<p id="p-52">Would you like to read the question?</p>
<p id="p-53">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-54">So again, this is from Louise Zombra.</p>
<p id="p-55">Now wall drop 2437.</p>
<p id="p-56">Long name, but good question.</p>
<p id="p-57">Yes, All right.</p>
<p id="p-58">He says, Hello, guys.</p>
<p id="p-59">Great podcast.</p>
<p id="p-60">I have an interesting question.</p>
<p id="p-61">Could I use the word christen for conveying the fact of using any item for the first time?</p>
<p id="p-62">And how common is this term?</p>
<p id="p-63">Oh, it's a good question, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-64">This is a good one.</p>
<p id="p-65">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-66">Yeah, this listener clearly has been absorbed in English native English and heard something and is coming to us with that question.</p>
<p id="p-67">Yeah, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-68">So Lindsay, do you hear christen being used like this?</p>
<p id="p-69">Do you do the first time?</p>
<p id="p-70">Yeah, I absolutely think that native speakers, not just religious native speakers, not at all.</p>
<p id="p-71">Just native speakers of English do use this word christen to christen.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-72">word christen, to christen something.</p>
<p id="p-73">A hundred percent.</p>
<p id="p-74">Yes, Yes, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-75">I mean, it does have also a religious context, dealing with baptism, I believe.</p>
<p id="p-76">And I think, you know, getting someone started on the religion when they're when they're baby, right?</p>
<p id="p-77">Right, Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-78">I believe it's related to that.</p>
<p id="p-79">But I think when people say this, they don't really think about that meaning.</p>
<p id="p-80">No.</p>
<p id="p-81">It's interesting because, right, like sometimes you have these words that are used in multiple ways and it seems like you would think of that first thing, right, like, oh, religious.</p>
<p id="p-82">But you don't say it and think of religion, I don't think.</p>
<p id="p-83">I really don't think so either, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-84">I think we use it in a more modern context and we're going to show our listeners how to do it today.</p>
<p id="p-85">Yeah, So where do we start?</p>
<p id="p-86">Yeah, So it can definitely be used to talk about using something for the first time.</p>
<p id="p-87">And I think it's pretty common.</p>
<p id="p-88">I mean, not every day would you use it?</p>
<p id="p-89">Yeah,</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-90">day would you use it?</p>
<p id="p-91">I don't know that it's used all the time, but it's fine to use.</p>
<p id="p-92">Do you feel comfortable using this?</p>
<p id="p-93">So you said you don't think about the religious aspect.</p>
<p id="p-94">Not really.</p>
<p id="p-95">I think when I use it, it's something that I'm doing for the first time.</p>
<p id="p-96">Usually it's using something, like unboxing it, you know?</p>
<p id="p-97">It's fresh and it's new and you're using it for the first time.</p>
<p id="p-98">So no, I don't think about church when I say this word.</p>
<p id="p-99">Today we're going to give you some examples and also other ways to talk about using something for the first time.</p>
<p id="p-100">Lindsay, can it be used about anything?</p>
<p id="p-101">Anything?</p>
<p id="p-102">Good question.</p>
<p id="p-103">What do you think?</p>
<p id="p-104">I don't know that I would just... First of all, it's one of those terms that we say to our listeners, don't use this all the time, over and over.</p>
<p id="p-105">I wouldn't say that it's... This is something to mix it up a little bit.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-106">to mix it up a little bit.</p>
<p id="p-107">It almost has kind of a spunky humorous sound to me, like, oh, we're going to christen the blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p id="p-108">Right, It's not.</p>
<p id="p-109">That's how I hear it with a little bit of intonation.</p>
<p id="p-110">Yeah, A little bit of personality behind it.</p>
<p id="p-111">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-112">What do you think?</p>
<p id="p-113">Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p id="p-114">There's a little bit of we're excited about this new thing and we're going to christen it.</p>
<p id="p-115">Right, We're going to use it for the first time.</p>
<p id="p-116">It's fresh.</p>
<p id="p-117">It's new.</p>
<p id="p-118">We're excited that it is the first time for sure.</p>
<p id="p-119">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-120">So let's you know, it can be used for a lot of things.</p>
<p id="p-121">Let's give some examples.</p>
<p id="p-122">So here we go.</p>
<p id="p-123">Come on.</p>
<p id="p-124">Let's christen the new wine glasses red or white.</p>
<p id="p-125">Yeah, And this is a good example because the other piece of this meaning is maybe you're making an event with people.</p>
<p id="p-126">That's a very good point.</p>
<p id="p-127">Yeah, And I and I think your example is perfect.</p>
<p id="p-128">Let's christen these wine glasses.</p>
<p id="p-129">Let's christen our new outdoor fireplace.</p>
<p id="p-130">Right, And that means we're coming together as a.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-131">And that means we're coming together as a group, we're going to create an event.</p>
<p id="p-132">And it's somewhat connected to socializing sometimes, I think.</p>
<p id="p-133">Not always, but sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-134">Don't you think?</p>
<p id="p-135">I think that's, yeah, I think that that's a really good point is about making something more of an event.</p>
<p id="p-136">Like, I don't know that I would say, oh, I'm going to christen my new book light and read by, you know, like, I don't know, it just doesn't, yeah, I think it is more of an event, which is why it might not be used as frequently.</p>
<p id="p-137">You wouldn't say this for everyday items, like you just ordered, like, I just ordered dental floss on Amazon, right?</p>
<p id="p-138">You wouldn't be like, I'm going to christen this new pack of dental floss now, no?</p>
<p id="p-139">Right, Right, That's hilarious.</p>
<p id="p-140">That's not right.</p>
<p id="p-141">So there is something of, there's some specialness here, there's an event, there might be other people involved helping you celebrate in a way.</p>
<p id="p-142">Yeah, Yeah, That's good.</p>
<p id="p-143">I'm sorry.</p>
<p id="p-144">I'm still like laughing.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-145">Or you could say, Oh, I just got a new bike.</p>
<p id="p-146">I'm excited to christen, but it's been too snowy to go out.</p>
<p id="p-147">Yeah, And here, you know, there's not necessarily a bunch of people standing around watching you use the new bike.</p>
<p id="p-148">So this is slightly different, but it still works.</p>
<p id="p-149">Yeah, Yeah, it's more it's like a little special, right?</p>
<p id="p-150">It's, it's not, you know, it's not dental floss, like it's not.</p>
<p id="p-151">But I mean, you can think of it.</p>
<p id="p-152">I mean, you could use it in a humorous way that in that way, like, so just a little story, my friend came over the other night, and they decided to make a key lime pie, which is like, one of my favorite things in the world.</p>
<p id="p-153">And yeah, and they didn't have we didn't have a juicer.</p>
<p id="p-154">And so my friend went out and he got us like, you know, just like a manual one.</p>
<p id="p-155">And we could have said, Oh, let's christen the new juicer, you know, in that kind of way.</p>
<p id="p-156">But again, that was an event.</p>
<p id="p-157">It's kind of funny.</p>
<p id="p-158">And so it can be used about something small, but only in that kind of</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-159">only in that kind of, I guess, that would fit into the event column, you know?</p>
<p id="p-160">Yeah, I completely agree.</p>
<p id="p-161">That's a good example.</p>
<p id="p-162">It's just something you're excited about for one reason or another.</p>
<p id="p-163">It's not a daily use thing that you just... It's just very... It's not mundane, okay?</p>
<p id="p-164">It's special.</p>
<p id="p-165">And then an iPhone, if you get a new phone, most of us end up having to buy a new phone every couple of years.</p>
<p id="p-166">I just got one.</p>
<p id="p-167">You just got one?</p>
<p id="p-168">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-169">Because your battery stops working and all these things, right?</p>
<p id="p-170">It's just how it goes.</p>
<p id="p-171">So for example, I got the new iPhone.</p>
<p id="p-172">I just set it up so I have to christen it and finally make my first phone call.</p>
<p id="p-173">If you make phone calls anymore, right?</p>
<p id="p-174">Who makes phone calls anymore?</p>
<p id="p-175">True.</p>
<p id="p-176">Maybe it doesn't even make phone calls.</p>
<p id="p-177">We don't know.</p>
<p id="p-178">That's possible, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-179">It's possible.</p>
<p id="p-180">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-181">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-182">Okay, Michelle, we are back from break.</p>
<p id="p-183">So where to now?</p>
<p id="p-184">What should we talk about here?</p>
<p id="p-185">Okay, well, let's talk about other ways that we can use this.</p>
<p id="p-186">So the first one is to break something in.</p>
<p id="p-187">So this one is often used about...</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-188">So, this one is often used about clothes, maybe something you have to put on, right?</p>
<p id="p-189">Yeah, But it can be used about other things.</p>
<p id="p-190">So, you could say, the seats in my new car are a bit stiff, but I think I just have to break them in more.</p>
<p id="p-191">Right, I mean, this really works great for anything leather.</p>
<p id="p-192">I mean, we know that leather needs to be broken in.</p>
<p id="p-193">It's not always the most comfortable when you first buy like a leather jacket or leather shoes, a leather couch.</p>
<p id="p-194">Maybe it's a little bit stiff.</p>
<p id="p-195">Leather needs to be broken in, but it goes beyond just leather, obviously.</p>
<p id="p-196">Different materials.</p>
<p id="p-197">Right, A pair of jeans.</p>
<p id="p-198">Right, Yeah, Whenever you wash your jeans, you feel like you have to break them in for the first time, right?</p>
<p id="p-199">Break them in.</p>
<p id="p-200">A pair of shoes.</p>
<p id="p-201">Yeah, It's true.</p>
<p id="p-202">Yeah, I think a lot of times this can happen talking about shoes because somebody might say, oh, these shoes, they're not really that comfortable.</p>
<p id="p-203">Maybe I just need to break them in more.</p>
<p id="p-204">Right, Use them more.</p>
<p id="p-205">Get them to be a little more flexible.</p>
<p id="p-206">Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, That's why when I bought my new ski boots, my father-in-law, who's a...</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-207">my new ski boots.</p>
<p id="p-208">My father-in-law, who's a hardcore skier, he's like an 8 to 4 skier.</p>
<p id="p-209">He does like heli skiing and crazy things.</p>
<p id="p-210">He said, �Your boots should be painful for the first three years of the life of the boot.</p>
<p id="p-211">It takes three years to break in your boots.</p>
<p id="p-212">More or less, two or three years to break in.</p>
<p id="p-213">So they're just painful all the time.</p>
<p id="p-214">And I'm still not sure if I'm breaking them in or if I got the wrong size.</p>
<p id="p-215">I like things that are broken in.</p>
<p id="p-216">That's why I don't really like buying new things.</p>
<p id="p-217">Because you have to give up the comfy thing, right?</p>
<p id="p-218">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-219">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-220">For sure.</p>
<p id="p-221">All right.</p>
<p id="p-222">What's the next one, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-223">Because I give it a try.</p>
<p id="p-224">Give it a try.</p>
<p id="p-225">Should we open up the game and give it a try?</p>
<p id="p-226">It's supposed to be so much fun.</p>
<p id="p-227">So maybe you got a new game, just trying something, right?</p>
<p id="p-228">You just bought something, you want to try it out.</p>
<p id="p-229">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-230">Or give it a whirl.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-231">A little bit different.</p>
<p id="p-232">So let's give the new vacuum a whirl.</p>
<p id="p-233">Yes, Or test something out.</p>
<p id="p-234">So let's test out the new TV.</p>
<p id="p-235">Right, So I just bought a new computer, a new laptop, and I still haven't turned it on yet, but I will be doing that tonight to give it a whirl, to give it a test, or test it out.</p>
<p id="p-236">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-237">So that's good.</p>
<p id="p-238">Yeah, That's a good example.</p>
<p id="p-239">I mean, which one of these do you use the most, would you say?</p>
<p id="p-240">That's a good question.</p>
<p id="p-241">I really like give it a whirl.</p>
<p id="p-242">I think it's cute.</p>
<p id="p-243">It's fun.</p>
<p id="p-244">Give it a whirl.</p>
<p id="p-245">It's fun to say.</p>
<p id="p-246">Give it a whirl.</p>
<p id="p-247">But I like break it in, too.</p>
<p id="p-248">Because, you know, when something, or breaking in a good pair of gloves, so they feel, you know the expression, it fits like a glove?</p>
<p id="p-249">Yeah, Yeah, That's only after you've broken in your glove.</p>
<p id="p-250">Right, Right, Yeah, I just love that feeling that you put something on and you know it belongs on your body.</p>
<p id="p-251">These jeans fit my body.</p>
<p id="p-252">These shoes fit my feet, no matter how weird the feet are.</p>
<p id="p-253">You know, everyone's talking about Bark &amp; Stock.</p>
<p id="p-254">Oh, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-255">Those really mold to your feet.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-256">Oh, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-257">Those really mold to your feet, don't they?</p>
<p id="p-258">Yeah, Oh, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-259">They're the best.</p>
<p id="p-260">Yeah, So should we do a role play?</p>
<p id="p-261">Of course, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-262">Here, what's the scenario?</p>
<p id="p-263">We are friends and you, I don't know, I am visiting your new office.</p>
<p id="p-264">Okay, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-265">All right.</p>
<p id="p-266">Yeah, All right.</p>
<p id="p-267">This place looks great.</p>
<p id="p-268">Thanks.</p>
<p id="p-269">I haven't christened all the tech in here, so I hope everything works.</p>
<p id="p-270">I'm sure it will.</p>
<p id="p-271">Did you test out the computers at least?</p>
<p id="p-272">Oh, yes.</p>
<p id="p-273">I did give them a try.</p>
<p id="p-274">Good.</p>
<p id="p-275">Oh, this new chair looks so comfy.</p>
<p id="p-276">Mind if I give it a whirl?</p>
<p id="p-277">Sure.</p>
<p id="p-278">Take it for a spin.</p>
<p id="p-279">Oh, wow.</p>
<p id="p-280">So comfortable.</p>
<p id="p-281">Did you break it in yet?</p>
<p id="p-282">Oh, no.</p>
<p id="p-283">Let me sit.</p>
<p id="p-284">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-285">Oh, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-286">That's also like office chairs are really nice when they fit you well.</p>
<p id="p-287">Oh, God.</p>
<p id="p-288">So good.</p>
<p id="p-289">Yeah, All right.</p>
<p id="p-290">What did we say here?</p>
<p id="p-291">You said, I haven't christened all the tech in here.</p>
<p id="p-292">So this is like,</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-293">So this is like an an event really you have a lot to do so you could use christened.</p>
<p id="p-294">Mm-hmm exactly perfect So that's the original question of the episode today.</p>
<p id="p-295">And then you said I'm sure it will did you test out the computers?</p>
<p id="p-296">So did you try them out?</p>
<p id="p-297">Did you test them out?</p>
<p id="p-298">Mm-hmm, and then you said yes, I did give them a try Mm-hmm, and then you said good.</p>
<p id="p-299">Oh, this new chair looks so comfy mind if I give it a whirl and I love that one So much personality in that phrase Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-300">Oh, yeah.</p>
