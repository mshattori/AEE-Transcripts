<p>How do native speakers use it to talk about doing something for the first time?</p>
<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p>about doing something for the first time.</p>
<p>Plus, what are other ways to express this idea and connect?</p>
<p>Find out today.</p>
<p>Hey there, Michelle.</p>
<p>How's it going today?</p>
<p>Hey, Lindsay.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Lindsay, what's the most recent purchase you made?</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, the most recent purchase I made, I just recently bought a Christmas gift for my partner and that was something.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So it's not something that you've tried yet, whatever.</p>
<p>No, I had to order it and it's coming today, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Well, that sounds exciting.</p>
<p>So my parents got my son a basketball hoop for his birthday.</p>
<p>He hasn't used it yet because it needs to be put together a little bit more, but I'm sure he's going to be excited to use it for the first time.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, So today we have a great question from a listener.</p>
<p>But before we get into that, we want to say thank you so much to those who...</p>

<p>We love your ideas.</p>
<p>This episode today, is it based on a question?</p>
<p>It is actually.</p>
<p>Yes, from YouTube.</p>
<p>Guys, if you aren't watching over on YouTube, and you</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>aren't watching over on YouTube, you and you want to see us here we are over on YouTube.</p>
<p>I'm waving Hello.</p>
<p>Yeah, So yeah, sometimes people submit their questions there.</p>
<p>So that's really great.</p>
<p>Let's see.</p>
<p>Would you like to read the question?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So again, this is from Louise Zombra.</p>
<p>Now wall drop 2437.</p>
<p>Long name, but good question.</p>
<p>Yes, All right.</p>
<p>He says, Hello, guys.</p>
<p>Great podcast.</p>
<p>I have an interesting question.</p>
<p>Could I use the word christen for conveying the fact of using any item for the first time?</p>
<p>And how common is this term?</p>
<p>Oh, it's a good question, Michelle.</p>
<p>This is a good one.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Yeah, this listener clearly has been absorbed in English native English and heard something and is coming to us with that question.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love it.</p>
<p>So Lindsay, do you hear christen being used like this?</p>
<p>Do you do the first time?</p>
<p>Yeah, I absolutely think that native speakers, not just religious native speakers, not at all.</p>
<p>Just native speakers of English do use this word christen to christen.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>word christen, to christen something.</p>
<p>A hundred percent.</p>
<p>Yes, Yes, Exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, it does have also a religious context, dealing with baptism, I believe.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, getting someone started on the religion when they're when they're baby, right?</p>
<p>Right, Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I believe it's related to that.</p>
<p>But I think when people say this, they don't really think about that meaning.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It's interesting because, right, like sometimes you have these words that are used in multiple ways and it seems like you would think of that first thing, right, like, oh, religious.</p>
<p>But you don't say it and think of religion, I don't think.</p>
<p>I really don't think so either, Michelle.</p>
<p>I think we use it in a more modern context and we're going to show our listeners how to do it today.</p>
<p>Yeah, So where do we start?</p>
<p>Yeah, So it can definitely be used to talk about using something for the first time.</p>
<p>And I think it's pretty common.</p>
<p>I mean, not every day would you use it?</p>
<p>Yeah,</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>day would you use it?</p>
<p>I don't know that it's used all the time, but it's fine to use.</p>
<p>Do you feel comfortable using this?</p>
<p>So you said you don't think about the religious aspect.</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>I think when I use it, it's something that I'm doing for the first time.</p>
<p>Usually it's using something, like unboxing it, you know?</p>
<p>It's fresh and it's new and you're using it for the first time.</p>
<p>So no, I don't think about church when I say this word.</p>
<p>Today we're going to give you some examples and also other ways to talk about using something for the first time.</p>
<p>Lindsay, can it be used about anything?</p>
<p>Anything?</p>
<p>Good question.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>I don't know that I would just... First of all, it's one of those terms that we say to our listeners, don't use this all the time, over and over.</p>
<p>I wouldn't say that it's... This is something to mix it up a little bit.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>to mix it up a little bit.</p>
<p>It almost has kind of a spunky humorous sound to me, like, oh, we're going to christen the blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Right, It's not.</p>
<p>That's how I hear it with a little bit of intonation.</p>
<p>Yeah, A little bit of personality behind it.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>There's a little bit of we're excited about this new thing and we're going to christen it.</p>
<p>Right, We're going to use it for the first time.</p>
<p>It's fresh.</p>
<p>It's new.</p>
<p>We're excited that it is the first time for sure.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>So let's you know, it can be used for a lot of things.</p>
<p>Let's give some examples.</p>
<p>So here we go.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Let's christen the new wine glasses red or white.</p>
<p>Yeah, And this is a good example because the other piece of this meaning is maybe you're making an event with people.</p>
<p>That's a very good point.</p>
<p>Yeah, And I and I think your example is perfect.</p>
<p>Let's christen these wine glasses.</p>
<p>Let's christen our new outdoor fireplace.</p>
<p>Right, And that means we're coming together as a.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>And that means we're coming together as a group, we're going to create an event.</p>
<p>And it's somewhat connected to socializing sometimes, I think.</p>
<p>Not always, but sometimes.</p>
<p>Don't you think?</p>
<p>I think that's, yeah, I think that that's a really good point is about making something more of an event.</p>
<p>Like, I don't know that I would say, oh, I'm going to christen my new book light and read by, you know, like, I don't know, it just doesn't, yeah, I think it is more of an event, which is why it might not be used as frequently.</p>
<p>You wouldn't say this for everyday items, like you just ordered, like, I just ordered dental floss on Amazon, right?</p>
<p>You wouldn't be like, I'm going to christen this new pack of dental floss now, no?</p>
<p>Right, Right, That's hilarious.</p>
<p>That's not right.</p>
<p>So there is something of, there's some specialness here, there's an event, there might be other people involved helping you celebrate in a way.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, That's good.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I'm still like laughing.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>Or you could say, Oh, I just got a new bike.</p>
<p>I'm excited to christen, but it's been too snowy to go out.</p>
<p>Yeah, And here, you know, there's not necessarily a bunch of people standing around watching you use the new bike.</p>
<p>So this is slightly different, but it still works.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, it's more it's like a little special, right?</p>
<p>It's, it's not, you know, it's not dental floss, like it's not.</p>
<p>But I mean, you can think of it.</p>
<p>I mean, you could use it in a humorous way that in that way, like, so just a little story, my friend came over the other night, and they decided to make a key lime pie, which is like, one of my favorite things in the world.</p>
<p>And yeah, and they didn't have we didn't have a juicer.</p>
<p>And so my friend went out and he got us like, you know, just like a manual one.</p>
<p>And we could have said, Oh, let's christen the new juicer, you know, in that kind of way.</p>
<p>But again, that was an event.</p>
<p>It's kind of funny.</p>
<p>And so it can be used about something small, but only in that kind of</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>only in that kind of, I guess, that would fit into the event column, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, I completely agree.</p>
<p>That's a good example.</p>
<p>It's just something you're excited about for one reason or another.</p>
<p>It's not a daily use thing that you just... It's just very... It's not mundane, okay?</p>
<p>It's special.</p>
<p>And then an iPhone, if you get a new phone, most of us end up having to buy a new phone every couple of years.</p>
<p>I just got one.</p>
<p>You just got one?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Because your battery stops working and all these things, right?</p>
<p>It's just how it goes.</p>
<p>So for example, I got the new iPhone.</p>
<p>I just set it up so I have to christen it and finally make my first phone call.</p>
<p>If you make phone calls anymore, right?</p>
<p>Who makes phone calls anymore?</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>Maybe it doesn't even make phone calls.</p>
<p>We don't know.</p>
<p>That's possible, Michelle.</p>
<p>It's possible.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Okay, Michelle, we are back from break.</p>
<p>So where to now?</p>
<p>What should we talk about here?</p>
<p>Okay, well, let's talk about other ways that we can use this.</p>
<p>So the first one is to break something in.</p>
<p>So this one is often used about...</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>So, this one is often used about clothes, maybe something you have to put on, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, But it can be used about other things.</p>
<p>So, you could say, the seats in my new car are a bit stiff, but I think I just have to break them in more.</p>
<p>Right, I mean, this really works great for anything leather.</p>
<p>I mean, we know that leather needs to be broken in.</p>
<p>It's not always the most comfortable when you first buy like a leather jacket or leather shoes, a leather couch.</p>
<p>Maybe it's a little bit stiff.</p>
<p>Leather needs to be broken in, but it goes beyond just leather, obviously.</p>
<p>Different materials.</p>
<p>Right, A pair of jeans.</p>
<p>Right, Yeah, Whenever you wash your jeans, you feel like you have to break them in for the first time, right?</p>
<p>Break them in.</p>
<p>A pair of shoes.</p>
<p>Yeah, It's true.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think a lot of times this can happen talking about shoes because somebody might say, oh, these shoes, they're not really that comfortable.</p>
<p>Maybe I just need to break them in more.</p>
<p>Right, Use them more.</p>
<p>Get them to be a little more flexible.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, That's why when I bought my new ski boots, my father-in-law, who's a...</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>my new ski boots.</p>
<p>My father-in-law, who's a hardcore skier, he's like an 8 to 4 skier.</p>
<p>He does like heli skiing and crazy things.</p>
<p>He said, �Your boots should be painful for the first three years of the life of the boot.</p>
<p>It takes three years to break in your boots.</p>
<p>More or less, two or three years to break in.</p>
<p>So they're just painful all the time.</p>
<p>And I'm still not sure if I'm breaking them in or if I got the wrong size.</p>
<p>I like things that are broken in.</p>
<p>That's why I don't really like buying new things.</p>
<p>Because you have to give up the comfy thing, right?</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>What's the next one, Lindsay?</p>
<p>Because I give it a try.</p>
<p>Give it a try.</p>
<p>Should we open up the game and give it a try?</p>
<p>It's supposed to be so much fun.</p>
<p>So maybe you got a new game, just trying something, right?</p>
<p>You just bought something, you want to try it out.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Or give it a whirl.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>A little bit different.</p>
<p>So let's give the new vacuum a whirl.</p>
<p>Yes, Or test something out.</p>
<p>So let's test out the new TV.</p>
<p>Right, So I just bought a new computer, a new laptop, and I still haven't turned it on yet, but I will be doing that tonight to give it a whirl, to give it a test, or test it out.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So that's good.</p>
<p>Yeah, That's a good example.</p>
<p>I mean, which one of these do you use the most, would you say?</p>
<p>That's a good question.</p>
<p>I really like give it a whirl.</p>
<p>I think it's cute.</p>
<p>It's fun.</p>
<p>Give it a whirl.</p>
<p>It's fun to say.</p>
<p>Give it a whirl.</p>
<p>But I like break it in, too.</p>
<p>Because, you know, when something, or breaking in a good pair of gloves, so they feel, you know the expression, it fits like a glove?</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, That's only after you've broken in your glove.</p>
<p>Right, Right, Yeah, I just love that feeling that you put something on and you know it belongs on your body.</p>
<p>These jeans fit my body.</p>
<p>These shoes fit my feet, no matter how weird the feet are.</p>
<p>You know, everyone's talking about Bark &amp; Stock.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Those really mold to your feet.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Those really mold to your feet, don't they?</p>
<p>Yeah, Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>They're the best.</p>
<p>Yeah, So should we do a role play?</p>
<p>Of course, Michelle.</p>
<p>Here, what's the scenario?</p>
<p>We are friends and you, I don't know, I am visiting your new office.</p>
<p>Okay, here we go.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Yeah, All right.</p>
<p>This place looks great.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I haven't christened all the tech in here, so I hope everything works.</p>
<p>I'm sure it will.</p>
<p>Did you test out the computers at least?</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>I did give them a try.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Oh, this new chair looks so comfy.</p>
<p>Mind if I give it a whirl?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Take it for a spin.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>So comfortable.</p>
<p>Did you break it in yet?</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Let me sit.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>That's also like office chairs are really nice when they fit you well.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>Yeah, All right.</p>
<p>What did we say here?</p>
<p>You said, I haven't christened all the tech in here.</p>
<p>So this is like,</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>So this is like an an event really you have a lot to do so you could use christened.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm exactly perfect So that's the original question of the episode today.</p>
<p>And then you said I'm sure it will did you test out the computers?</p>
<p>So did you try them out?</p>
<p>Did you test them out?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm, and then you said yes, I did give them a try Mm-hmm, and then you said good.</p>
<p>Oh, this new chair looks so comfy mind if I give it a whirl and I love that one So much personality in that phrase Michelle.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Yes It's a little childlike.</p>
<p>It's it's like cute.</p>
<p>You know, it just it gives I don't know.</p>
<p>It makes me think of actually Spinning around in the chair Yeah, and then you said sure take it for a spin, which is a bonus That can also sometimes be used for especially cars Bike things like that, but this is a creative use of take it for a spin I love it when we take an idiom that usually applies to one context and we bring it into</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>applies to one context and we bring it into another context.</p>
<p>Right, And that's what we're doing here because you're just talking about trying a chair, right?</p>
<p>Right, And literally you might be, it's kind of a bit of a pun around, right?</p>
<p>Because you're spinning around in the chair, but you're also trying it out.</p>
<p>And normally, again, that applies to test driving a car, test driving something like a bike, as you said, Michelle, right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>And then you said, did you, oh no, I said, did you break it in yet?</p>
<p>So I'm at, you know, maybe it's like a leather chair.</p>
<p>And so I'm saying, oh, did you like really have a chance to sit in it yet?</p>
<p>Break it in, get comfy.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>This has been good, Michelle.</p>
<p>Is there another episode our listeners could find to go to right now to keep learning with us?</p>

<p>What's the final thought?</p>
<p>Getting something new and trying it out is very exciting.</p>
<p>And so we want to have some variety to talk about this.</p>
<p>Christen is a great one to use, especially for an event, not for dental floss.</p>
<p>But now when you floss, when you open that new floss tonight, Lindsay, I want you to think about it.</p>
<p>Enjoy christening the floss.</p>
<p>So we gave you lots of different contexts and when is best to use them and for what.</p>
<p>But yeah, so give these a try.</p>
<p>We hope, especially this time of year, I probably did a lot of shopping around the holidays.</p>
<p>So it might be a good time to use this.</p>
<p>Well, shopping and socializing.</p>
<p>And just to take the socializing piece one step further, this can also be used to invite people over.</p>
<p>Come over and help us christen our new kitchen.</p>
<p>We just got a kitchen renovation.</p>
<p>Come over and help us christen this beautiful bottle of wine that we bought in France.</p>
<p>That's delicious.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p>in France, right?</p>
<p>So you can use it to again to spice up your invitations, especially around the holiday season, right?</p>
<p>Or yeah, Valentine's season is coming up lots of exciting opportunities there to use that phrase.</p>
