<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p>in English.</p>
<p>Hello Lindsay, how are you?</p>
<p>Feeling good today, Aubrey.</p>
<p>How are you today?</p>
<p>How's it going?</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>I have a question for you.</p>
<p>Do you like to chit-chat?</p>
<p>Do I like to chit-chat?</p>
<p>Sometimes I do if I feel like it's interesting chit-chat, but sometimes chit-chat can be kind of superficial.</p>
<p>You don't seem like a big chit-chatter to me, right?</p>
<p>This is very much like small talk, superficial, like you said.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that you will like ask an interesting question to try and get deeper before you let the chit-chat go very long.</p>
<p>I'm guilty of this and sometimes my partner says, you go too deep too fast, you know, when you're at a party, you need to be more superficial, but it just bores me, you know, so not much of a chit-chatter.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm the same.</p>
<p>I'm the same where sometimes I'll have like an interesting question I've been thinking about and I'll throw it out there and then immediately realize like I should have let the chit-chat go a few minutes longer, I think.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>minutes longer, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, Or people's eyes are like, oh, wow, that was quick.</p>
<p>I mean, it's either that or maybe you're just at the wrong party.</p>
<p>I mean, sometimes it's just it's a matter of just who you're around, right?</p>
<p>Because sometimes those questions could be right with a certain group.</p>
<p>But generally, yeah, for a mainstream party, mainstream culture, too deep, right?</p>

<p>Okay, Aubrey.</p>
<p>So today we are talking about this topic of chit chatting, chatting and different ways to say this.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of nuanced meanings here between exactly right, because there is a big difference between conversation, discussions and chit chat.</p>
<p>chit chat is small talk, right?</p>
<p>It's casual conversation about unimportant topics.</p>
<p>We use it as both a noun and a verb.</p>
<p>So we'll give examples for both.</p>
<p>But like you said, Lindsay, some people get impatient with chit chat, like they would rather talk about something important more quickly.</p>
<p>Yeah, superficial, it could feel really superficial.</p>
<p>So for example, the dinner was fun.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>For example, the dinner was fun, lots of chit-chat and laughter, and it doesn't have to always be negative.</p>
<p>Of course, it depends on who's saying it, and maybe it was interesting chit-chat.</p>
<p>With certain people, interesting chit-chat can exist, right?</p>
<p>It's true.</p>
<p>It really depends, and we do use it more generally like this.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean people were just talking about the weather, but it kind of means we didn't go super deep.</p>
<p>No one's talking politics if you said there was lots of chit-chat, but we're probably all sort of catching up about what's been going on in our lives.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>What's another example, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe at work, you might say, the meeting went long since there was a lot of chit-chat.</p>
<p>This kind of means like between agenda items, people are bringing up, they're like saying, oh, you'll never guess what happened to, right?</p>
<p>There's some small talk.</p>
<p>There's some chit-chat happening.</p>
<p>Yeah, And I think we mostly use it as a noun, but there is a way to use it as a verb, right?</p>
<p>For example, I was chit-chatting with a lady at the park and realized we went to the same university.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Right, So what's interesting here, and we're going to dive into chat in a second.</p>
<p>Anytime you say chit-chatting as a verb, you could just say chatting.</p>
<p>I was chatting with a lady at the park, but sometimes you will hear people say chit-chatting.</p>
<p>Yeah, It's interesting why they add that chit, right, when it comes to it.</p>
<p>I would tend to say just chatting, but how does it kind of change it?</p>
<p>I think it does imply a little more superficiality.</p>
<p>If I was chatting with a lady at the park, that could be about politics.</p>
<p>But if I say I was chit-chatting, we were not talking about anything important.</p>
<p>Because even chatting is pretty light, and we'll talk about that now, but chit-chatting even lighter.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Right, And you might say, you know, you could say, I don't really like to chit-chat.</p>
<p>So here you're using it as an infinitive, still a verb, right?</p>
<p>And then I'd rather talk about important things.</p>
<p>Yeah, And we have a public service announcement for our listeners.</p>
<p>Right, Aubrey, tell us about this, a PSA.</p>
<p>Yeah, you guys have heard this before.</p>
<p>Jessica and I know we say this on the IELTS Energy podcast sometimes, you cannot always trust the thesaurus.</p>
<p>Yeah, </p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>If you're looking for synonyms, I put chitchat in because I was just curious what would come up.</p>
<p>And I feel very few of those words could I actually use as a synonym, right?</p>
<p>It was like blather, jabber, murmur, and some words I haven't heard of.</p>
<p>I don't know if they're more like in the UK, twaddle, tattle, which is more like... Anyway, I was like, these aren't really synonyms.</p>
<p>So I could understand, I could see someone looking in the thesaurus and then using words that have a more nuanced meaning.</p>
<p>You really need to learn words in context.</p>
<p>I mean, that's why we're here.</p>
<p>That's why we do role plays in almost every single episode.</p>
<p>We need to know nuances, especially at the B2C1 level where many of our listeners are.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Right, So one word that does mean the same as chitchat is just chat as a verb, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, This gets a little tricky because chat as a noun functions a little differently.</p>
<p>So as a verb, I would totally say, right, the happy hour yesterday was great.</p>
<p>I chatted with pretty much everyone there.</p>
<p>It's more just a...</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>there.</p>
<p>It's more just means just talked.</p>
<p>I talked to everyone there.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But as a noun, right, or a gerund, chatting, there was a lot of chatting during the meeting.</p>
<p>You could hear that too, right?</p>
<p>Exactly, right?</p>
<p>You might say chatter or chatting.</p>
<p>We use it this way as a noun.</p>
<p>There was a lot of chatting happening or I hear a lot of chatting.</p>
<p>Can we keep it down?</p>
<p>Yeah, And I think the word chatter, so chatter would be a good synonym for that, right?</p>
<p>Instead of you could say it in the same moment, but the word chatter I've also heard can mean, I don't know, when like FBI agents are investigating things, like any kind of attack that's going to happen, they'll go and they'll say, oh, there's been chatter on this.</p>
<p>That means kind of in the back channels, whatever sources they use, whichever phones they've tapped, they're hearing the chatter from all of these things, right?</p>
<p>And it doesn't mean it's like two ladies talking at a party, right?</p>
<p>It's more like there's signals, there's information, there's activity, right?</p>
<p>So I think that's an interesting way to use it.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Right, It means both of those things.</p>
<p>And then as</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Right, It means both of those things.</p>
<p>And then as a noun, this is interesting because chat, we don't use the same way as chitchat as a noun, right?</p>
<p>It means usually more of like an online conversation, right?</p>
<p>Did you see the message in the group chat?</p>
<p>And we wouldn't replace like this when I said the dinner was fun, lots of chitchat and laughter.</p>
<p>We wouldn't say lots of chat and laughter.</p>
<p>We can't use it that way as a noun.</p>
<p>Right, That's interesting, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah, Weird.</p>
<p>Yeah, Aubrey, are you involved in a lot of like WhatsApp chat, group chats, like family, friends, ongoing, constantly?</p>
<p>Do you do that kind of thing?</p>
<p>Yes, I feel like I'm in so many of them.</p>
<p>And often there are new ones that'll be formed that are like minus someone because they had a birthday maybe and there's a surprise.</p>
<p>So then you have so many different ones that you lose track of who's in which one.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>Yeah, That's a reality of our modern tech.</p>
<p>This is how we communicate now.</p>
<p>It's another way of socializing.</p>
<p>A hundred percent.</p>
<p>Yes, Absolutely.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What else?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So the next one, when I looked at the thesaurus, one of those that I feel like is a good synonym is the verb gab, right?</p>
<p>This also means, you know, it's usually about trivial matters.</p>
<p>If you're gabbing, if you say someone likes to gab, but it sort of implies that you're talking at length.</p>
<p>I wouldn't say people were gabbing if it were a 30 second conversation and they left.</p>
<p>You could say that.</p>
<p>It could be quick.</p>
<p>Gabbing sort of means at length.</p>
<p>Yeah, For some reason, when I think of gabbing, I think of gossiping, but I don't think it's not the same thing.</p>
<p>You could be gabbing and gossiping at the same time, potentially.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>They could go hand in hand for sure.</p>
<p>So an example, she was gabbing at the park when she got the call.</p>
<p>So she was just talking.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Or I have a friend that's fun to gab with.</p>
<p>And this might mean gossip, but you're talking about anything, right?</p>
<p>It does imply trivial matters.</p>
<p>I would not assume you're talking about.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>I would not assume you're talking about deep political conversations or, you know, how can we serve in our community if we say we're gabbing, it kind of just means we're just like chit-chatting.</p>
<p>Yeah, So most of these phrases from today are really about superficial conversations, not deeper ones.</p>
<p>Yeah, Then we have gift of gab.</p>
<p>And I do hear this in places or read this in places sometimes.</p>
<p>I do too.</p>
<p>This is very idiomatic.</p>
<p>It means someone likes to talk.</p>
<p>They're very good at making conversation.</p>
<p>I think this is a great compliment if someone tells me that I have the gift of gab.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>It's good.</p>
<p>It's a great life skill.</p>
<p>That is for sure.</p>
<p>For example, I'm not worried about him meeting my friends.</p>
<p>He has the gift of gab.</p>
<p>So I think he'll be fine.</p>
<p>And that's really nice when your partner is just really strong socially, you just don't have to worry about them.</p>
<p>They could go off on their own for hours and they'd be totally fine.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Right, This is ideal when you bring you're having friends meet each other.</p>
<p>If they don't have the gift of gab, you feel like you need to keep them there and</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>you feel like you need to keep them there and talk with them, keep them included in the conversation.</p>
<p>If they have the gift of gab, you can leave them.</p>
<p>They're going to be chatting with everyone in the room.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's a good thing for sure.</p>
<p>What's another example?</p>
<p>You might say a good lawyer has the gift of gab, right?</p>
<p>This is a lot of professions.</p>
<p>They need to be, they need to enjoy speaking in front of people.</p>
<p>So this is interesting because it's not just about trivial matters.</p>
<p>You're just mean they like to speak.</p>
<p>They're good at speaking, right?</p>
<p>I would think lawyers, yes.</p>
<p>I would say more like argue or not argue, but create an argument, create a sort of reasoning, right?</p>
<p>But also reporters are really good.</p>
<p>Investigative reporters, right?</p>
<p>Oh yes, good point, right?</p>
<p>Cause they're able to like make people feel comfortable chatting and then get the information out of them that they want.</p>
<p>That's huge.</p>
<p>A hugely important skill for a reporter.</p>
<p>Yes, Totally.</p>
<p>Okay, Aubrey.</p>
<p>So let's do a role play.</p>
<p>So here we are friends meeting up after.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>We are friends meeting up after not having seen each other for some amount of time.</p>
<p>So perfect.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, Sorry.</p>
<p>I've been gabbing so much about my kids.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>I'm doing okay.</p>
<p>I'm just glad to be able to chit chat with you.</p>
<p>It had been way too long.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>We need to do this more often.</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>We used to meet up to chat weekly.</p>
<p>Life gets so busy.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>And I'm bad at staying in touch too.</p>
<p>I've never had the gift of gab.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>That's not really true for me.</p>
<p>I definitely have the gift of gab, but not so much on the phone.</p>
<p>I'm not a phone talker is how I say it.</p>
<p>So I'll lose touch with friends if they live far away.</p>
<p>But then once we're in person, we're going to be chit chatting away.</p>
<p>Yeah, It can be hard.</p>
<p>You have to be really intentional about the phone, making phone dates with friends.</p>
<p>It's a lot of work.</p>
<p>It's true.</p>
<p>It's true.</p>
<p>Especially if friends like need contact more often, right, then that's a good idea to set a date.</p>
<p>Be like, we're going to talk on this day.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So let's see what we said here.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>So let's see what we said here.</p>
<p>Aubrey, you said, sorry, I've been gabbing so much about my kids.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>So it looks like we were already in this conversation.</p>
<p>You've been talking and you're going to flip it back to me.</p>
<p>Yeah, we've been chatting.</p>
<p>And then I started talking about my kids at length.</p>
<p>This is a great way to say, oh, sorry, I was gabbing so long about this one topic.</p>
<p>Yes, Yes, And then I said, doing OK, I'm just glad to be able to chit chat with you.</p>
<p>Right, So just I'm enjoying the time chatting or chit chatting with you.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>And both would work.</p>
<p>I'm just glad to be able to chat with you or to chit chat with you.</p>
<p>Very interchangeable there.</p>
<p>Yeah, And I want to highlight some grammar here, Aubrey.</p>
<p>So here we said it had been way too long, but we could also have said, and I might more commonly just say it's been way too long.</p>
<p>So both work, right?</p>
<p>They're both accurate.</p>
<p>This is kind of the tricky thing about past perfect.</p>
<p>We don't use it that often.</p>
<p>It's accurate here.</p>
<p>But often we just skip it and say, oh, it's been way too long.</p>
<p>Right, Because we're kind of, you know, we talk about two steps back with past perfect.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>we talk about two steps back with past perfect, but we're kind of still right in this moment, right?</p>
<p>We're not too far away from it.</p>
<p>The further away we get, the more likely we are to use that past perfect.</p>
<p>So good point.</p>
<p>Yeah, What else Aubrey?</p>
<p>And then you said we used to meet up to chat weekly.</p>
<p>So this is where we use this as a verb.</p>
<p>It means the same as chit chat, right?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>And then you deployed your favorite phrase here.</p>
<p>I'm bad at staying in touch too.</p>
<p>I've never had the gift of gab.</p>
<p>Yes, This is a fun compliment.</p>
<p>I think that's a fun connection skill.</p>
<p>If you meet someone who is good at talking, loves to talk.</p>
<p>This is nice to say you have the gift of gab.</p>
<p>It's a very positive way to say, oh, you're so good at talking to people.</p>
<p>Yeah, Super interesting.</p>
<p>Well, there's another episode that our listeners could get into to hear more of us gabbing, right?</p>
<p>Talking, chatting, chit chatting on the podcast.</p>
<p>I love this one.</p>
<p>It was episode 1052.</p>
<p>So maybe come back to the blog so you don't have to scroll aways.</p>
<p>Three questions to consider when you start a conversation with someone who is</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>consider when you start a conversation with someone who is working.</p>
<p>I really loved that episode because you might want to chit chat at work and just gab away, but if they're working, there are some things you want to think about before you jump into that conversation.</p>
<p>That's really important.</p>
<p>And by the way, I want to mention, if you're listening in the app, the iOS Android app, you actually don't have to go to the blog.</p>
<p>You could just go to the search bar at the very top of the episode list and type in a unique word.</p>
<p>For example, you could type in, uh, working or three questions and that episode will come up.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That's an even easier way to dive into the back catalog.</p>
<p>Yes, Love it.</p>
<p>Aubrey, where do we leave our listeners for today?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, don't hesitate to chit chat, right?</p>
<p>You might be more like Lindsay where you'd rather talk about deep topics, but it is vital to start conversations with a little bit of chit chat, you know, just that small talk asking people just kind of warm up before we dive deeper.</p>
<p>Yeah, You really, you have to start somewhere.</p>
<p>It's not realistic to go deep, but right away, no one does that.</p>
<p>That's not normal.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>but right away.</p>
<p>No one does that.</p>
<p>That's not normal, right?</p>
<p>So start light.</p>
<p>And then if you feel like you have a connection, start to ask more interesting questions from there.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Right, And today's vocab gives you fun options for chatting about chatting because we do this, right?</p>
<p>You notice in this role play, all of this could come up, right?</p>
<p>You want to have many ways to say it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>Great topic today, and I'll see you next time.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
