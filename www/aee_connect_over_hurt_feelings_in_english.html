<p>Letter C number 1. Hello, Aubrey.</p>
<p>How are you today?</p>
<p>I'm great, Lindsay.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>I'm great, Lindsay.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Glad to be on the microphone.</p>
<p>All good.</p>
<p>What are we talking about on the show today?</p>
<p>I have a question to start us out.</p>
<p>When's the last time you were hurt?</p>
<p>Oh, well, I had some pain.</p>
<p>I had a cut on my face recently, a few weeks ago on my eye, actually, and that really hurt.</p>
<p>Actually, it really stung.</p>
<p>Yeah, that sounds really painful.</p>
<p>I've had eye injuries before, too.</p>
<p>I feel like anything you have a lot of nerve endings in your face, right?</p>
<p>So that would hurt a lot.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>And in your scalp and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>But I'm curious, what would change if instead I asked, when's the last time you felt hurt?</p>
<p>That would probably be more about an emotional pain, right?</p>
<p>Because the fact that you use the word felt points more to the feelings inside, not so much the cuts and scrapes and bruises.</p>
<p>Right, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>There's a big difference between I am hurt and I feel hurt.</p>
<p>This question can</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>hurt.</p>
<p>This question came up in our Q&amp;A. Tracy brought it up.</p>
<p>It was a great question about all the ways we use hurt in English.</p>
<p>So we're going to dive into these today.</p>
<p>Really interesting.</p>
<p>It was a great conversation.</p>
<p>I'm excited to talk about it here.</p>
<p>I bet it was.</p>
<p>And just a reminder for our listeners, what is Q&amp;A? Well, that is a special feature only available for students who purchase our courses, but not just our courses, those who choose the personal coach plan in our courses.</p>
<p>Get a chance to attend the weekly Q&amp;A where they can bring questions from their course and have them answered directly.</p>
<p>So just keep that in mind, listeners.</p>
<p>The next time you join one of our courses, join the personal coach plan to get in.</p>
<p>Yes, it's an amazing weekly class.</p>
<p>Everyone brings really interesting questions.</p>
<p>It's usually a pretty small group and a great conversation.</p>
<p>So if you're not in there, you are missing out.</p>
<p>Yeah, really good opportunity.</p>
<p>So all right, so let's get into it, Aubrey.</p>
<p>Where shall we start today?</p>
<p>Yes, we're going to start with just I'm hurt, like you were saying,</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>I'm hurt, like you were saying, you were hurt because you had like a cut on your face.</p>
<p>And this means physical injury or pain, right?</p>
<p>So you can say I'm hurt or I'm in pain.</p>
<p>And here we're talking about physical injury.</p>
<p>Yeah, what I usually say is I usually say I got hurt.</p>
<p>I'll talk about it in the past tense.</p>
<p>I got hurt last week when I fell while skiing and bumped my knee, something like that.</p>
<p>Yes, definitely, right?</p>
<p>Because if we say I am hurt or I am in pain, it's almost like you're describing it to a doctor more, right?</p>
<p>If you're going to tell someone you're injured, yeah, we'd say I got hurt when something happened.</p>
<p>When we said those two phrases, I imagined walking into the ER or something, right?</p>
<p>I'm hurt, I'm in pain.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Yes, hopefully not.</p>
<p>Here's an example.</p>
<p>Oh, no, I'm hurt.</p>
<p>I rolled my ankle.</p>
<p>Yeah, and this is where I'm imagining like you're playing volleyball and you fall, right?</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>and you fall, right?</p>
<p>And I think you're right.</p>
<p>I still would maybe say I got hurt here.</p>
<p>Oh, I got hurt.</p>
<p>I rolled my ankle.</p>
<p>But it would make sense to say, you know, oh, no, I'm hurt.</p>
<p>I rolled my ankle.</p>
<p>It's grammatically correct.</p>
<p>It doesn't feel super natural to me to say I'm hurt, right?</p>
<p>Oh, no, I got hurt or ooh, that hurts.</p>
<p>Oh, more like that hurts, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, This hurts, that hurts.</p>
<p>Yeah, Interesting.</p>
<p>And then you could ask someone, you know, are you hurt?</p>
<p>Or how bad does it hurt if someone else has clearly been injured and you're trying to assess how serious it is?</p>
<p>Yes, I like that.</p>
<p>All right, now let's flip over to the emotional side of things.</p>
<p>And this is what you asked at the top of the show, right?</p>
<p>I feel hurt.</p>
<p>I feel hurt.</p>
<p>Yeah, emotional pain, maybe disappointment or sadness.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we don't use this for anger, right?</p>
<p>We wouldn't say I'm hurt by what this person did.</p>
<p>If we're feeling angry, we'd say I'm mad, I'm angry, I'm frustrated.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>I'm mad.</p>
<p>I'm angry.</p>
<p>I'm frustrated.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>So for example, I wish you hadn't said that.</p>
<p>You hurt me, right?</p>
<p>Yes, and you're not saying I'm angry.</p>
<p>You're saying I feel disappointed or saddened.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe kind of a disagreement you're having with your spouse, for example, something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, a friend, right?</p>
<p>If they maybe lie to you or say something negative, they tell you you don't look good in your jeans, something like that, that could hurt your feelings, right?</p>
<p>It just makes you feel bad.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>What's another example, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yeah, it really hurt when he said he didn't want to be my friend.</p>
<p>Oh, my son said this to me not long ago because kids are so honest and sometimes they don't realize how something will hurt feelings.</p>
<p>I say, oh, you want to be my friend?</p>
<p>No, thanks.</p>
<p>Oh, no, thanks.</p>
<p>No, thanks.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, that's so cute.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, that's true.</p>
<p>I don't know at what age they develop.</p>
<p>I guess they develop it over time, right?</p>
<p>Put that level of empathy to really understand the impact</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>to really understand the impact of their words, so we can't take it too seriously.</p>
<p>And the age might be different for every kid, right?</p>
<p>The parents, they're saying like, okay, let's be nice.</p>
<p>Think about how you would feel if someone said that to you.</p>
<p>Right, I mean, even my niece is still, she's 11 now and she's still incredibly blunt.</p>
<p>Like she'll, you know, she used to say she loved my hair and now that my hair is not like the style that everyone's wearing, the center part.</p>
<p>Yeah, Now when I see her, she'd be like, I hate your hair.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>She's like, your hair is so outdated, Lindsay.</p>
<p>That's really funny.</p>
<p>You need to fix your hair.</p>
<p>Just tell you like it is.</p>
<p>You're just following trends, you know?</p>
<p>That's really funny.</p>
<p>Yeah, And so you might say to her, you know, oh, that hurt my feelings.</p>
<p>I often tell my kids like, just don't comment on someone's physical appearance, you know?</p>
<p>Yes, Because it's likely to hurt someone's feelings.</p>
<p>Yes, I like, I should start saying that to her when she says that because she needs to know by 11.</p>
<p>Right, These things can be hurtful.</p>
<p>I like my hair, okay?</p>
<p>I like my feelings.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Next one.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>All right, next one, it hurts, right?</p>
<p>So this is something is causing physical or emotional pain.</p>
<p>For example, my back hurts, right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Or it hurts to be rejected, right?</p>
<p>So this is for both physical and emotional pain when we're just describing it as a state, we'll just say it hurts, something hurts.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>And now the next one is an idiom.</p>
<p>So now we can get into, for example, on the IELTS exam, maybe this could be good in part three.</p>
<p>What do you think, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Absolutely, right?</p>
<p>You have to use idiomatic language on IELTS, but also in your daily conversations.</p>
<p>Idioms make language so much more interesting.</p>
<p>And this is a fun one.</p>
<p>It's in a world of hurt.</p>
<p>So this means that someone is in trouble or facing serious consequences.</p>
<p>My dad said this to me a lot.</p>
<p>He'd say, you will be in a world of hurt if you don't get your chores done, for example.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And I knew that it wasn't like he was physically going to hurt me.</p>
<p>He was what he meant was</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>to hurt me.</p>
<p>What he meant was there will be consequences.</p>
<p>Oh, it's kind of a cool trademark for your dad, right?</p>
<p>All of our parents have their own little language trademarks.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>Yeah, so if I miss this deadline, I'll be in a world of hurt.</p>
<p>Yeah, we might say that at work, right?</p>
<p>And all we mean, we're not talking about physical or emotional pain here.</p>
<p>We're meaning that I'm going to be in trouble.</p>
<p>I'm going to have some kind of consequence if I don't do this.</p>
<p>Or maybe you're just going to be extremely stressed out or you don't prepare the presentation, I'll be in a world of hurt right before because I'll be stressed up to my eyeballs, you know?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>This is super useful.</p>
<p>You can use this in daily conversations or at work.</p>
<p>It just means I'm going to regret it.</p>
<p>Yes, And what else, Aubrey?</p>
<p>We have one more.</p>
<p>Oh, this is the one your dad would say, right?</p>
<p>This is the one my dad said.</p>
<p>I pulled the second example here first.</p>
<p>And you will hear, I think, parents say this to kids, right?</p>
<p>It's just a way of saying like, there will be consequences for your actions.</p>
<p>You'll be in a world of hurt if you don't do that.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>You'll be in a world of hurt if you don't do that.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>Okay, Aubrey, let's jump into a role play.</p>
<p>And by the way, I was chatting with one student at our Open Conversation Club this morning, and she said she loves our role plays.</p>
<p>So I think we are on the right track with these All Ears English role plays here.</p>
<p>They're so fun.</p>
<p>I love thinking of all the different scenarios, like this one, you are a doctor and I have come in with a hurt arm.</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>I like this.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right, here we go.</p>
<p>Ooh, that looks like it hurts.</p>
<p>Now, how did it happen?</p>
<p>Yeah, I hurt it when I slipped and fell on some ice in a parking lot.</p>
<p>Well, on a scale of one to 10, how much does it hurt?</p>
<p>Maybe six.</p>
<p>It feels numb now more than anything.</p>
<p>Well, hopefully you're not left-handed or you'll be in a world of hurt.</p>
<p>Well, that's not very sensitive to say.</p>
<p>Not the best bedside manner, Lindsay.</p>
<p>Work on that.</p>
<p>I need to work on my bedside manner, absolutely.</p>
<p>So here we go.</p>
<p>We broke it down.</p>
<p>So you came in and you had a broken arm, right?</p>
<p>And I said, ooh, that looks like it hurts.</p>
<p>That's a common chunk for sure.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>Hurt.</p>
<p>That's a common chunk for sure.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Right, Just meaning like that looks like it's painful is what this means.</p>
<p>And interestingly, in the roleplay description, I've come in with a hurt arm.</p>
<p>This is where we use it as an adjective.</p>
<p>This is another meaning, right?</p>
<p>I have a hurt arm and there it's an adjective instead of a verb like most of these.</p>
<p>Right, Nice.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then what it now used it as a verb here.</p>
<p>What did you say?</p>
<p>Yeah, I hurt it when I slipped and fell.</p>
<p>So this is the same meaning as injured.</p>
<p>I injured it.</p>
<p>I hurt it.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>I hurt it when I and usually we bring those together pronunciation wise, right?</p>
<p>I hurt it when I slipped and fell.</p>
<p>Almost sounds like one word sometimes.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And just like you pointed out, we'll often say I got hurt, right?</p>
<p>Oh, I got hurt when I slipped and fell.</p>
<p>We'll also say this.</p>
<p>I hurt it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I broke it.</p>
<p>But this is where I don't know it's broken, so I'll just say I hurt it.</p>
<p>Yeah, If you want to focus on the arm itself, I hurt it instead of I got hurt when I slipped and fell.</p>
<p>Right, Exactly.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>When I slipped and fell, right?</p>
<p>And then I'm asking you on a scale of 1 to 10, how much does it hurt?</p>
<p>Where's your pain?</p>
<p>What's your pain level?</p>
<p>How much does it hurt?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And then you said this one that we said was not very good bedside manner to say, because it's clearly my left arm that's injured.</p>
<p>Hopefully you're not left-handed or you'll be in a world of hurt, meaning it's going to be hard to write.</p>
<p>It's going to be hard to do some of your actions because the doctor's probably looking at it and can tell maybe it's broken.</p>
<p>It's clearly a very serious injury.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's hard.</p>
<p>I remember in college in my tennis practice once, one day I played college tennis, tennis practice, broke my wrist.</p>
<p>It was a hairline fracture and everything was so hard to do.</p>
<p>Brushing my hair, getting dressed, everything was so difficult for a good four weeks, five weeks.</p>
<p>Did you have a brace that you wore on it?</p>
<p>Yeah, it wasn't a cast, but it was a brace.</p>
<p>Yeah, just like all the ways you use your hands, right?</p>
<p>To get ready and everything.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>ready in everything.</p>
<p>It makes you really appreciate.</p>
<p>I have a good friend whose daughter has limb differences and it's amazing all of the technology that has come out to help.</p>
<p>But it's just amazing how a lot of people are able to live with a difference like that.</p>
<p>And we struggle so much just with a couple of weeks of having to live that way.</p>
<p>I know, very impressive, absolutely.</p>
<p>So Aubrey, what's another episode that we could go to to check out?</p>
<p>Yeah, we wanna make sure that you don't miss a recent episode of the Business English Podcast, 379, why you should not hem and haw at work.</p>
<p>This is some more fun idiomatic language and also some good tips if you work in English.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So if you're not following the Business English Podcast, that's a whole other podcast and it's equally amazing.</p>
<p>So go over and open your search bar, type in Business English, hit the follow button and check out 379.</p>
<p>All right, good.</p>
<p>And as a takeaway, what a great way to connect if you are feeling either physical or emotional.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>feeling either physical or emotional pain, right?</p>
<p>You don't need to hide it.</p>
<p>It's okay.</p>
<p>I talk to my kids about this a lot, right?</p>
<p>It's okay to be in pain.</p>
<p>It's okay to cry.</p>
<p>You know, be vulnerable about your emotional or physical pain.</p>
<p>It's so true.</p>
<p>I mean, it can make you become closer to people.</p>
<p>It can make people know you better, know what you actually care about.</p>
<p>So now our listeners have the words to do it, right?</p>
<p>Especially if like a friend hurt your feelings, right?</p>
<p>You wouldn't want to bottle that up and then resent them, right?</p>
<p>Right, Now you have the vocabulary to express that and communicate about it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Good stuff.</p>
<p>Aubrey, thanks for being on the show.</p>
