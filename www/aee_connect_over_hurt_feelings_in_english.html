<p id="p-20">Letter C number 1. Hello, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-21">How are you today?</p>
<p id="p-22">I'm great, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-23">How are you?</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-24">I'm great, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-25">How are you?</p>
<p id="p-26">Good.</p>
<p id="p-27">Glad to be on the microphone.</p>
<p id="p-28">All good.</p>
<p id="p-29">What are we talking about on the show today?</p>
<p id="p-30">I have a question to start us out.</p>
<p id="p-31">When's the last time you were hurt?</p>
<p id="p-32">Oh, well, I had some pain.</p>
<p id="p-33">I had a cut on my face recently, a few weeks ago on my eye, actually, and that really hurt.</p>
<p id="p-34">Actually, it really stung.</p>
<p id="p-35">Yeah, that sounds really painful.</p>
<p id="p-36">I've had eye injuries before, too.</p>
<p id="p-37">I feel like anything you have a lot of nerve endings in your face, right?</p>
<p id="p-38">So that would hurt a lot.</p>
<p id="p-39">For sure.</p>
<p id="p-40">And in your scalp and that sort of thing.</p>
<p id="p-41">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-42">But I'm curious, what would change if instead I asked, when's the last time you felt hurt?</p>
<p id="p-43">That would probably be more about an emotional pain, right?</p>
<p id="p-44">Because the fact that you use the word felt points more to the feelings inside, not so much the cuts and scrapes and bruises.</p>
<p id="p-45">Right, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-46">Right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-47">There's a big difference between I am hurt and I feel hurt.</p>
<p id="p-48">This question can</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-49">hurt.</p>
<p id="p-50">This question came up in our Q&amp;A. Tracy brought it up.</p>
<p id="p-51">It was a great question about all the ways we use hurt in English.</p>
<p id="p-52">So we're going to dive into these today.</p>
<p id="p-53">Really interesting.</p>
<p id="p-54">It was a great conversation.</p>
<p id="p-55">I'm excited to talk about it here.</p>
<p id="p-56">I bet it was.</p>
<p id="p-57">And just a reminder for our listeners, what is Q&amp;A? Well, that is a special feature only available for students who purchase our courses, but not just our courses, those who choose the personal coach plan in our courses.</p>
<p id="p-58">Get a chance to attend the weekly Q&amp;A where they can bring questions from their course and have them answered directly.</p>
<p id="p-59">So just keep that in mind, listeners.</p>
<p id="p-60">The next time you join one of our courses, join the personal coach plan to get in.</p>
<p id="p-61">Yes, it's an amazing weekly class.</p>
<p id="p-62">Everyone brings really interesting questions.</p>
<p id="p-63">It's usually a pretty small group and a great conversation.</p>
<p id="p-64">So if you're not in there, you are missing out.</p>
<p id="p-65">Yeah, really good opportunity.</p>
<p id="p-66">So all right, so let's get into it, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-67">Where shall we start today?</p>
<p id="p-68">Yes, we're going to start with just I'm hurt, like you were saying,</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-69">I'm hurt, like you were saying, you were hurt because you had like a cut on your face.</p>
<p id="p-70">And this means physical injury or pain, right?</p>
<p id="p-71">So you can say I'm hurt or I'm in pain.</p>
<p id="p-72">And here we're talking about physical injury.</p>
<p id="p-73">Yeah, what I usually say is I usually say I got hurt.</p>
<p id="p-74">I'll talk about it in the past tense.</p>
<p id="p-75">I got hurt last week when I fell while skiing and bumped my knee, something like that.</p>
<p id="p-76">Yes, definitely, right?</p>
<p id="p-77">Because if we say I am hurt or I am in pain, it's almost like you're describing it to a doctor more, right?</p>
<p id="p-78">If you're going to tell someone you're injured, yeah, we'd say I got hurt when something happened.</p>
<p id="p-79">When we said those two phrases, I imagined walking into the ER or something, right?</p>
<p id="p-80">I'm hurt, I'm in pain.</p>
<p id="p-81">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-82">Yes, hopefully not.</p>
<p id="p-83">Here's an example.</p>
<p id="p-84">Oh, no, I'm hurt.</p>
<p id="p-85">I rolled my ankle.</p>
<p id="p-86">Yeah, and this is where I'm imagining like you're playing volleyball and you fall, right?</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-87">and you fall, right?</p>
<p id="p-88">And I think you're right.</p>
<p id="p-89">I still would maybe say I got hurt here.</p>
<p id="p-90">Oh, I got hurt.</p>
<p id="p-91">I rolled my ankle.</p>
<p id="p-92">But it would make sense to say, you know, oh, no, I'm hurt.</p>
<p id="p-93">I rolled my ankle.</p>
<p id="p-94">It's grammatically correct.</p>
<p id="p-95">It doesn't feel super natural to me to say I'm hurt, right?</p>
<p id="p-96">Oh, no, I got hurt or ooh, that hurts.</p>
<p id="p-97">Oh, more like that hurts, right?</p>
<p id="p-98">Yeah, This hurts, that hurts.</p>
<p id="p-99">Yeah, Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-100">And then you could ask someone, you know, are you hurt?</p>
<p id="p-101">Or how bad does it hurt if someone else has clearly been injured and you're trying to assess how serious it is?</p>
<p id="p-102">Yes, I like that.</p>
<p id="p-103">All right, now let's flip over to the emotional side of things.</p>
<p id="p-104">And this is what you asked at the top of the show, right?</p>
<p id="p-105">I feel hurt.</p>
<p id="p-106">I feel hurt.</p>
<p id="p-107">Yeah, emotional pain, maybe disappointment or sadness.</p>
<p id="p-108">Interestingly, we don't use this for anger, right?</p>
<p id="p-109">We wouldn't say I'm hurt by what this person did.</p>
<p id="p-110">If we're feeling angry, we'd say I'm mad, I'm angry, I'm frustrated.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-111">I'm mad.</p>
<p id="p-112">I'm angry.</p>
<p id="p-113">I'm frustrated.</p>
<p id="p-114">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-115">So for example, I wish you hadn't said that.</p>
<p id="p-116">You hurt me, right?</p>
<p id="p-117">Yes, and you're not saying I'm angry.</p>
<p id="p-118">You're saying I feel disappointed or saddened.</p>
<p id="p-119">Yeah, maybe kind of a disagreement you're having with your spouse, for example, something like that.</p>
<p id="p-120">Yeah, a friend, right?</p>
<p id="p-121">If they maybe lie to you or say something negative, they tell you you don't look good in your jeans, something like that, that could hurt your feelings, right?</p>
<p id="p-122">It just makes you feel bad.</p>
<p id="p-123">Yeah, of course.</p>
<p id="p-124">What's another example, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-125">Yeah, it really hurt when he said he didn't want to be my friend.</p>
<p id="p-126">Oh, my son said this to me not long ago because kids are so honest and sometimes they don't realize how something will hurt feelings.</p>
<p id="p-127">I say, oh, you want to be my friend?</p>
<p id="p-128">No, thanks.</p>
<p id="p-129">Oh, no, thanks.</p>
<p id="p-130">No, thanks.</p>
<p id="p-131">Oh, my God, that's so cute.</p>
<p id="p-132">Yeah, no, that's true.</p>
<p id="p-133">I don't know at what age they develop.</p>
<p id="p-134">I guess they develop it over time, right?</p>
<p id="p-135">Put that level of empathy to really understand the impact</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-136">to really understand the impact of their words, so we can't take it too seriously.</p>
<p id="p-137">And the age might be different for every kid, right?</p>
<p id="p-138">The parents, they're saying like, okay, let's be nice.</p>
<p id="p-139">Think about how you would feel if someone said that to you.</p>
<p id="p-140">Right, I mean, even my niece is still, she's 11 now and she's still incredibly blunt.</p>
<p id="p-141">Like she'll, you know, she used to say she loved my hair and now that my hair is not like the style that everyone's wearing, the center part.</p>
<p id="p-142">Yeah, Now when I see her, she'd be like, I hate your hair.</p>
<p id="p-143">Oh no.</p>
<p id="p-144">She's like, your hair is so outdated, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-145">That's really funny.</p>
<p id="p-146">You need to fix your hair.</p>
<p id="p-147">Just tell you like it is.</p>
<p id="p-148">You're just following trends, you know?</p>
<p id="p-149">That's really funny.</p>
<p id="p-150">Yeah, And so you might say to her, you know, oh, that hurt my feelings.</p>
<p id="p-151">I often tell my kids like, just don't comment on someone's physical appearance, you know?</p>
<p id="p-152">Yes, Because it's likely to hurt someone's feelings.</p>
<p id="p-153">Yes, I like, I should start saying that to her when she says that because she needs to know by 11.</p>
<p id="p-154">Right, These things can be hurtful.</p>
<p id="p-155">I like my hair, okay?</p>
<p id="p-156">I like my feelings.</p>
<p id="p-157">Totally.</p>
<p id="p-158">All right.</p>
<p id="p-159">Next one.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-160">All right, next one, it hurts, right?</p>
<p id="p-161">So this is something is causing physical or emotional pain.</p>
<p id="p-162">For example, my back hurts, right?</p>
<p id="p-163">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-164">Or it hurts to be rejected, right?</p>
<p id="p-165">So this is for both physical and emotional pain when we're just describing it as a state, we'll just say it hurts, something hurts.</p>
<p id="p-166">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-167">And now the next one is an idiom.</p>
<p id="p-168">So now we can get into, for example, on the IELTS exam, maybe this could be good in part three.</p>
<p id="p-169">What do you think, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-170">Absolutely, right?</p>
<p id="p-171">You have to use idiomatic language on IELTS, but also in your daily conversations.</p>
<p id="p-172">Idioms make language so much more interesting.</p>
<p id="p-173">And this is a fun one.</p>
<p id="p-174">It's in a world of hurt.</p>
<p id="p-175">So this means that someone is in trouble or facing serious consequences.</p>
<p id="p-176">My dad said this to me a lot.</p>
<p id="p-177">He'd say, you will be in a world of hurt if you don't get your chores done, for example.</p>
<p id="p-178">Oh, interesting.</p>
<p id="p-179">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-180">And I knew that it wasn't like he was physically going to hurt me.</p>
<p id="p-181">He was what he meant was</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-182">to hurt me.</p>
<p id="p-183">What he meant was there will be consequences.</p>
<p id="p-184">Oh, it's kind of a cool trademark for your dad, right?</p>
<p id="p-185">All of our parents have their own little language trademarks.</p>
<p id="p-186">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-187">Yeah, so if I miss this deadline, I'll be in a world of hurt.</p>
<p id="p-188">Yeah, we might say that at work, right?</p>
<p id="p-189">And all we mean, we're not talking about physical or emotional pain here.</p>
<p id="p-190">We're meaning that I'm going to be in trouble.</p>
<p id="p-191">I'm going to have some kind of consequence if I don't do this.</p>
<p id="p-192">Or maybe you're just going to be extremely stressed out or you don't prepare the presentation, I'll be in a world of hurt right before because I'll be stressed up to my eyeballs, you know?</p>
<p id="p-193">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-194">This is super useful.</p>
<p id="p-195">You can use this in daily conversations or at work.</p>
<p id="p-196">It just means I'm going to regret it.</p>
<p id="p-197">Yes, And what else, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-198">We have one more.</p>
<p id="p-199">Oh, this is the one your dad would say, right?</p>
<p id="p-200">This is the one my dad said.</p>
<p id="p-201">I pulled the second example here first.</p>
<p id="p-202">And you will hear, I think, parents say this to kids, right?</p>
<p id="p-203">It's just a way of saying like, there will be consequences for your actions.</p>
<p id="p-204">You'll be in a world of hurt if you don't do that.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-205">You'll be in a world of hurt if you don't do that.</p>
<p id="p-206">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-207">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-208">Okay, Aubrey, let's jump into a role play.</p>
<p id="p-209">And by the way, I was chatting with one student at our Open Conversation Club this morning, and she said she loves our role plays.</p>
<p id="p-210">So I think we are on the right track with these All Ears English role plays here.</p>
<p id="p-211">They're so fun.</p>
<p id="p-212">I love thinking of all the different scenarios, like this one, you are a doctor and I have come in with a hurt arm.</p>
<p id="p-213">Okay, good.</p>
<p id="p-214">I like this.</p>
<p id="p-215">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-216">All right, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-217">Ooh, that looks like it hurts.</p>
<p id="p-218">Now, how did it happen?</p>
<p id="p-219">Yeah, I hurt it when I slipped and fell on some ice in a parking lot.</p>
<p id="p-220">Well, on a scale of one to 10, how much does it hurt?</p>
<p id="p-221">Maybe six.</p>
<p id="p-222">It feels numb now more than anything.</p>
<p id="p-223">Well, hopefully you're not left-handed or you'll be in a world of hurt.</p>
<p id="p-224">Well, that's not very sensitive to say.</p>
<p id="p-225">Not the best bedside manner, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-226">Work on that.</p>
<p id="p-227">I need to work on my bedside manner, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-228">So here we go.</p>
<p id="p-229">We broke it down.</p>
<p id="p-230">So you came in and you had a broken arm, right?</p>
<p id="p-231">And I said, ooh, that looks like it hurts.</p>
<p id="p-232">That's a common chunk for sure.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-233">Hurt.</p>
<p id="p-234">That's a common chunk for sure.</p>
<p id="p-235">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-236">Right, Just meaning like that looks like it's painful is what this means.</p>
<p id="p-237">And interestingly, in the roleplay description, I've come in with a hurt arm.</p>
<p id="p-238">This is where we use it as an adjective.</p>
<p id="p-239">This is another meaning, right?</p>
<p id="p-240">I have a hurt arm and there it's an adjective instead of a verb like most of these.</p>
<p id="p-241">Right, Nice.</p>
<p id="p-242">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-243">And then what it now used it as a verb here.</p>
<p id="p-244">What did you say?</p>
<p id="p-245">Yeah, I hurt it when I slipped and fell.</p>
<p id="p-246">So this is the same meaning as injured.</p>
<p id="p-247">I injured it.</p>
<p id="p-248">I hurt it.</p>
<p id="p-249">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-250">I hurt it when I and usually we bring those together pronunciation wise, right?</p>
<p id="p-251">I hurt it when I slipped and fell.</p>
<p id="p-252">Almost sounds like one word sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-253">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-254">And just like you pointed out, we'll often say I got hurt, right?</p>
<p id="p-255">Oh, I got hurt when I slipped and fell.</p>
<p id="p-256">We'll also say this.</p>
<p id="p-257">I hurt it.</p>
<p id="p-258">Yeah, I broke it.</p>
<p id="p-259">But this is where I don't know it's broken, so I'll just say I hurt it.</p>
<p id="p-260">Yeah, If you want to focus on the arm itself, I hurt it instead of I got hurt when I slipped and fell.</p>
<p id="p-261">Right, Exactly.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-262">When I slipped and fell, right?</p>
<p id="p-263">And then I'm asking you on a scale of 1 to 10, how much does it hurt?</p>
<p id="p-264">Where's your pain?</p>
<p id="p-265">What's your pain level?</p>
<p id="p-266">How much does it hurt?</p>
<p id="p-267">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-268">And then you said this one that we said was not very good bedside manner to say, because it's clearly my left arm that's injured.</p>
<p id="p-269">Hopefully you're not left-handed or you'll be in a world of hurt, meaning it's going to be hard to write.</p>
<p id="p-270">It's going to be hard to do some of your actions because the doctor's probably looking at it and can tell maybe it's broken.</p>
<p id="p-271">It's clearly a very serious injury.</p>
<p id="p-272">Yeah, it's hard.</p>
<p id="p-273">I remember in college in my tennis practice once, one day I played college tennis, tennis practice, broke my wrist.</p>
<p id="p-274">It was a hairline fracture and everything was so hard to do.</p>
<p id="p-275">Brushing my hair, getting dressed, everything was so difficult for a good four weeks, five weeks.</p>
<p id="p-276">Did you have a brace that you wore on it?</p>
<p id="p-277">Yeah, it wasn't a cast, but it was a brace.</p>
<p id="p-278">Yeah, just like all the ways you use your hands, right?</p>
<p id="p-279">To get ready and everything.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-280">ready in everything.</p>
<p id="p-281">It makes you really appreciate.</p>
<p id="p-282">I have a good friend whose daughter has limb differences and it's amazing all of the technology that has come out to help.</p>
<p id="p-283">But it's just amazing how a lot of people are able to live with a difference like that.</p>
<p id="p-284">And we struggle so much just with a couple of weeks of having to live that way.</p>
<p id="p-285">I know, very impressive, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-286">So Aubrey, what's another episode that we could go to to check out?</p>
<p id="p-287">Yeah, we wanna make sure that you don't miss a recent episode of the Business English Podcast, 379, why you should not hem and haw at work.</p>
<p id="p-288">This is some more fun idiomatic language and also some good tips if you work in English.</p>
<p id="p-289">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-290">So if you're not following the Business English Podcast, that's a whole other podcast and it's equally amazing.</p>
<p id="p-291">So go over and open your search bar, type in Business English, hit the follow button and check out 379.</p>
<p id="p-292">All right, good.</p>
<p id="p-293">And as a takeaway, what a great way to connect if you are feeling either physical or emotional.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-294">feeling either physical or emotional pain, right?</p>
<p id="p-295">You don't need to hide it.</p>
<p id="p-296">It's okay.</p>
<p id="p-297">I talk to my kids about this a lot, right?</p>
<p id="p-298">It's okay to be in pain.</p>
<p id="p-299">It's okay to cry.</p>
<p id="p-300">You know, be vulnerable about your emotional or physical pain.</p>
<p id="p-301">It's so true.</p>
<p id="p-302">I mean, it can make you become closer to people.</p>
<p id="p-303">It can make people know you better, know what you actually care about.</p>
<p id="p-304">So now our listeners have the words to do it, right?</p>
