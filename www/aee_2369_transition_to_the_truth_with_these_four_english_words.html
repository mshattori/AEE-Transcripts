<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-20">now, allearsenglish.com slash C1, letter C, number 1. Hey, Michelle, how's it going?</p>
<p id="p-21">Good, Lindsay, how was your weekend?</p>
<p id="p-22">Oh, it was great.</p>
<p id="p-23">I mean, well, I was sick, but I still got some nice relaxing in.</p>
<p id="p-24">Oh, okay, I hope you feel better.</p>
<p id="p-25">Thank you.</p>
<p id="p-26">Sorry, I was sick, that was just for the simple, for our role play.</p>
<p id="p-27">I had a nice weekend, actually, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-28">Good, good, good.</p>
<p id="p-29">So today we are going to talk about how to elaborate when you are getting more detailed or telling the truth.</p>
<p id="p-30">I'm excited about this because this is one of the key skills that I think our listeners at the B2 or even C1 level need to really become natural.</p>
<p id="p-31">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-32">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-33">So this is actually going to be, it's kind of a follow up to episode 2350 of All Ears English.</p>
<p id="p-34">So you can check</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-35">of All Ears English.</p>
<p id="p-36">So you can check out that one.</p>
<p id="p-37">It's a mixed bag, how to talk about variety in English.</p>
<p id="p-38">And we used this in a roleplay and realized it would be a very useful episode to dive in more in another area.</p>
<p id="p-39">So we're actually going to read the roleplay.</p>
<p id="p-40">This is from that 2350.</p>
<p id="p-41">So again, go ahead, listen to that one after this episode.</p>
<p id="p-42">And let's do what we did on that episode.</p>
<p id="p-43">So here we go.</p>
<p id="p-44">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-45">And how do you like the area?</p>
<p id="p-46">I like it.</p>
<p id="p-47">I mean, it varies.</p>
<p id="p-48">I like certain aspects like the coffee shops, but there aren't many good restaurants here.</p>
<p id="p-49">Yeah, It's just so incredibly natural, Michelle, the way it's kind of a transition, right?</p>
<p id="p-50">Yeah, it is.</p>
<p id="p-51">Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-52">It's a transition to the truth, basically.</p>
<p id="p-53">It gets more specific.</p>
<p id="p-54">To me, this is interesting because it expresses the truth saying, I mean, right?</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-55">I mean, right?</p>
<p id="p-56">Because at first you said, oh, I like it.</p>
<p id="p-57">I mean, and you get more specific, you express the truth.</p>
<p id="p-58">And we decided that we wanted to do an episode about using words to elaborate, get more specific, say the truth.</p>
<p id="p-59">Yes, Yeah, So this is a follow up to that one.</p>
<p id="p-60">And on this episode, we're going to focus on these tiny ways to change the tone or get more specific.</p>
<p id="p-61">So this is going to be a really useful one.</p>
<p id="p-62">Again, a lot of times we don't think about these tiny, teeny tiny words, right?</p>
<p id="p-63">Things like, I mean, right?</p>
<p id="p-64">But they can be very useful.</p>
<p id="p-65">100%. So let's give our listeners some examples and then we'll see how it comes out in natural English.</p>
<p id="p-66">So here's one.</p>
<p id="p-67">I love my new computer.</p>
<p id="p-68">I mean, it was a little expensive, but it's great.</p>
<p id="p-69">OK, So you're adding nuance, adding the truth.</p>
<p id="p-70">You're kind of annoyed that you paid so much, right?</p>
<p id="p-71">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-72">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-73">Or the new job</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-74">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-75">Or the new job is going really well.</p>
<p id="p-76">I mean, it could be better, but overall I think it was a good switch.</p>
<p id="p-77">Yeah, But you know what's interesting about this?</p>
<p id="p-78">This is reality.</p>
<p id="p-79">I mean, most people are never 100% satisfied with something, right?</p>
<p id="p-80">Most of the time you're going to find something about a job, about a computer, about a new home, right?</p>
<p id="p-81">That's just not quite right.</p>
<p id="p-82">And we need language to be able to communicate that to be human.</p>
<p id="p-83">Okay?</p>
<p id="p-84">Right, And a lot of times, I guess, you know, this could be a cultural thing that we start off with the good, right?</p>
<p id="p-85">We start, oh, everything's great, right?</p>
<p id="p-86">Good point.</p>
<p id="p-87">I mean, you're getting a little bit more of the real answer, but we have this tendency.</p>
<p id="p-88">It's like how when you say, how are you?</p>
<p id="p-89">Oh, good, good.</p>
<p id="p-90">Yeah, Yeah, No, that's a really good point.</p>
<p id="p-91">This very much could be cultural.</p>
<p id="p-92">In some cultures, our listeners could actually just be going right into the thing that they don't like about it because maybe that's the way things are presented, for better or for worse, right?</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-93">For better or for worse, right?</p>
<p id="p-94">Let's read one more example, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-95">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-96">All right.</p>
<p id="p-97">So she's been really helpful.</p>
<p id="p-98">I mean, sometimes she has trouble getting here on time, so there is room for improvement.</p>
<p id="p-99">Yeah, Or it's like how they say that you should have the sandwich where it's like the positive and then the meat is kind of the negative, but then you have the bread on the other side, which is the positive.</p>
<p id="p-100">Yeah, Right, So you're starting out with the broad statement, and then you're getting a little more specific.</p>
<p id="p-101">You're zeroing in on something that may not be so perfect.</p>
<p id="p-102">But I mean, yeah, why is this helpful?</p>
<p id="p-103">We talked about, I said, zeroing in.</p>
<p id="p-104">What is that?</p>
<p id="p-105">That's a good bonus for today.</p>
<p id="p-106">What does it mean to zero in on something?</p>
<p id="p-107">Yeah, that's a great bonus for today.</p>
<p id="p-108">So focus in, laser focus, right?</p>
<p id="p-109">You're going to zoom in would be another way of saying that on one specific thing.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-110">on one specific thing.</p>
<p id="p-111">And I actually think that sometimes the other way this is used is we're thinking about the person.</p>
<p id="p-112">Like if you ask me about this new person at work, she's great.</p>
<p id="p-113">And then I say, oh, I mean, there's a few more things that come to mind.</p>
<p id="p-114">And I mean, it's kind of time to think a little bit too.</p>
<p id="p-115">True, it's a little bit, yeah, it shows that you're actually thinking about what to say next.</p>
<p id="p-116">And you're kind of saying, wait a second.</p>
<p id="p-117">Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-118">So it could be that something hadn't quite occurred to you yet because overall you're happy with the person, but there are a few little things that come to mind as you're kind of opening up that inquiry, right?</p>
<p id="p-119">Right, yes.</p>
<p id="p-120">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-121">All right, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-122">So there's other ways we can do this and that we do do this.</p>
<p id="p-123">We transition to the truth.</p>
<p id="p-124">I love the way you said that, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-125">What would be one of them?</p>
<p id="p-126">All right, one of them is, well, just, well.</p>
<p id="p-127">And let's take a minute</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-128">Let's take a minute, let's go through these, and then let's talk about that intonation because it's very important how we say these things.</p>
<p id="p-129">So but well is very similar to I mean.</p>
<p id="p-130">So I'm feeling really good about our vacation plans.</p>
<p id="p-131">Well, just not really the cost.</p>
<p id="p-132">The truth comes out.</p>
<p id="p-133">Or the blue would be great here.</p>
<p id="p-134">Well, maybe it's too dark.</p>
<p id="p-135">Here I'm just thinking, I'm reconsidering, right?</p>
<p id="p-136">You're kind of changing your mind, actually.</p>
<p id="p-137">Changing my mind.</p>
<p id="p-138">Yeah, So I could use your help.</p>
<p id="p-139">Well, are you able to help or would it be a waste of time?</p>
<p id="p-140">So again, getting a little bit more specific, saying this is a little bit different.</p>
<p id="p-141">I mean, you're saying the truth in this way of you've reconsidered and you're saying, I just thought about it.</p>
<p id="p-142">You might not have the time.</p>
<p id="p-143">Yeah, And what do we need to know about the intonation here, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-144">Because it is important, right?</p>
<p id="p-145">So with</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-146">is important, right?</p>
<p id="p-147">So with all of these, I would say it's this, meh.</p>
<p id="p-148">Yeah, well, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-149">You're sounding like kind of really confident in the first piece.</p>
<p id="p-150">I'm feeling really good about our vacation plans.</p>
<p id="p-151">And you're saying, you're ready to go.</p>
<p id="p-152">And then, well, you kind of take this little pause before, well, or I mean, right?</p>
<p id="p-153">Yeah, it's like it's a lurch forward and then a pull back, right?</p>
<p id="p-154">Yes, that's true.</p>
<p id="p-155">That's true.</p>
<p id="p-156">I like that.</p>
<p id="p-157">That's interesting.</p>
<p id="p-158">Or, okay, so let's go over another one.</p>
<p id="p-159">Okay, actually.</p>
<p id="p-160">Actually is also, I'm sure our listeners have heard this being used in this way, but let's zoom in on this here.</p>
<p id="p-161">So I'm really comfortable.</p>
<p id="p-162">Actually, there's a bit of a chill in here.</p>
<p id="p-163">Can we turn up the heat a bit?</p>
<p id="p-164">Right, So yeah, this happens a lot, right?</p>
<p id="p-165">Sometimes you'll be at someone's home and they'll say, are you good?</p>
<p id="p-166">Are you warm enough?</p>
<p id="p-167">Oh yeah, I'm totally comfortable.</p>
<p id="p-168">Actually, there's a little bit of a</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-169">Actually, there's a little bit of a breeze, right?</p>
<p id="p-170">Would you mind turning up the heat?</p>
<p id="p-171">Right, Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-172">It might feel guilty asking sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-173">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-174">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-175">What else?</p>
<p id="p-176">Okay, we had a good first date.</p>
<p id="p-177">Actually, there were some things that didn't go so well.</p>
<p id="p-178">And people can lie to themselves in the dating world too, right?</p>
<p id="p-179">Sometimes, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-180">Gloss over things a little bit.</p>
<p id="p-181">Yeah, yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-182">All right, let's do one more that we can use.</p>
<p id="p-183">Yeah, truthfully.</p>
<p id="p-184">So this one, I would say, is the least common of the group, but it's good to have in your back pocket.</p>
<p id="p-185">It's a bit more formal, right?</p>
<p id="p-186">So he's having a great day.</p>
<p id="p-187">Truthfully, he did get upset right when his parents left, but he's okay now.</p>
<p id="p-188">Okay, so maybe the parents dropped him off at school.</p>
<p id="p-189">He's a little kid.</p>
<p id="p-190">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-191">I'm exercising five times a week.</p>
<p id="p-192">Truthfully...</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-193">five times a week.</p>
<p id="p-194">Truthfully, three times a week.</p>
<p id="p-195">Yeah, And another thing I want to point out is that we can sometimes combine these together.</p>
<p id="p-196">So sometimes they say things like, well, actually, so we had a good first date.</p>
<p id="p-197">Well, actually, there were some things that didn't go too well.</p>
<p id="p-198">Right, Or combining I mean and well.</p>
<p id="p-199">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-200">He's a great student.</p>
<p id="p-201">I mean, well, I think we should discuss his reading level.</p>
<p id="p-202">And you could have also said, well, I mean, right?</p>
<p id="p-203">You could kind of play with these a little bit here.</p>
<p id="p-204">Or you could do well, truthfully.</p>
<p id="p-205">So I like my doctor.</p>
<p id="p-206">Well, truthfully, it takes a little long to get an appointment, but it's worth it.</p>
<p id="p-207">Yeah, And I'm glad you brought that up, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-208">That is really common to combine two of them, maybe because we need a little more time to present that downside.</p>
<p id="p-209">We feel a little maybe socially awkward or I don't know.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-210">word or I don't know, I think it could be cultural, Michelle, as you mentioned.</p>
<p id="p-211">I think that's such a good point because we don't like to bring the bad news, right?</p>
<p id="p-212">We want things to be rosy.</p>
<p id="p-213">And so maybe we need two of these transition to the truth words to kind of delay, I don't know, or to think, to prepare the person for it.</p>
<p id="p-214">Yeah, Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-215">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-216">So before we get into our role play for today, we want to say thank you so much to our reviewers.</p>
<p id="p-217">Yes, we love reading your reviews.</p>
<p id="p-218">We have a five-star review here from AsonSA94 from Germany, originally from Iran, but now living in Germany, on January 26th.</p>
<p id="p-219">So huge thank you to Ason.</p>
<p id="p-220">We have a five-star review from BBNoBreadBorna from Canada on January 24th, and a five-star review from Lily from South Korea on January 19th.</p>
<p id="p-221">Huge thank you to each of you.</p>
<p id="p-222">Thank you so much.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-223">Each of you.</p>
<p id="p-224">Thank you so much.</p>
<p id="p-225">We really appreciate it.</p>
<p id="p-226">Guys, remember if you haven't yet, please leave your review wherever you're listening to All Ears English.</p>
<p id="p-227">We do read them.</p>
<p id="p-228">We do love them.</p>
<p id="p-229">We are so thankful for them and we will shout you out on a show.</p>
<p id="p-230">You got it.</p>
<p id="p-231">All right.</p>
<p id="p-232">Great, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-233">Let's go into our role play here, shall we?</p>
<p id="p-234">All right.</p>
<p id="p-235">So here we are, friends, and you are asking for recommendations for a hairdresser.</p>
<p id="p-236">All right.</p>
<p id="p-237">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-238">So I really like Chelsea at Hair for Us.</p>
<p id="p-239">Oh, yeah?</p>
<p id="p-240">Yeah, I mean, she isn't the most chatty person, but she's really talented.</p>
<p id="p-241">Oh, that's okay.</p>
<p id="p-242">Well, I hope she's at least friendly.</p>
<p id="p-243">She's friendly.</p>
<p id="p-244">Well, actually, sometimes she gets frustrated, but still, it's worth it.</p>
<p id="p-245">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-246">She sounds great.</p>
<p id="p-247">Truthfully, I'm a little worried about some of what you said.</p>
<p id="p-248">I'd still go for it.</p>
<p id="p-249">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-250">Are you the kind of person that wants a chatty stylist?</p>
<p id="p-251">Yeah, I was going to ask you the same question.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-252">Yeah, I was gonna ask you the same question.</p>
<p id="p-253">I'm good either way.</p>
<p id="p-254">I think I like to chat.</p>
<p id="p-255">I like to chat.</p>
<p id="p-256">What about you?</p>
<p id="p-257">Yeah, Obviously for me, I'd rather have a good stylist, right?</p>
<p id="p-258">So I had a really good stylist in Brooklyn and I was so sad when I moved to Boston from New York.</p>
<p id="p-259">I actually was going down to New York to get my haircut because I did not want to leave her.</p>
<p id="p-260">But she wasn't chatty at all, but she was great.</p>
<p id="p-261">Just really talented.</p>
<p id="p-262">I'd rather have that than someone who's average and chats the whole time.</p>
<p id="p-263">I want them to focus on the hair, you know?</p>
<p id="p-264">Totally agree.</p>
<p id="p-265">Totally agree.</p>
<p id="p-266">But yeah, it's interesting with like a hairstylist.</p>
<p id="p-267">People can have those relationships for years and years, have the same person do their hair.</p>
<p id="p-268">It's really interesting.</p>
<p id="p-269">It's really interesting.</p>
<p id="p-270">Yeah, All right.</p>
<p id="p-271">So here we have some great examples of transitioning to the truth, right?</p>
<p id="p-272">So first you said, I really like Chelsea at Hair for Us and I said, oh yeah?</p>
<p id="p-273">And you said, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-274">I mean, she isn't the most chatty person.</p>
<p id="p-275">So here comes the downside, the truth, right?</p>
<p id="p-276">Right, And for you,</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-277">Right?</p>
<p id="p-278">And for you, it might not be a bad thing.</p>
<p id="p-279">But so maybe for me, I feel like maybe I'd like her to talk a little bit more.</p>
<p id="p-280">So I'm posing it as a negative thing.</p>
<p id="p-281">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-282">Then what did you use here?</p>
<p id="p-283">So then you said, oh, that's okay.</p>
<p id="p-284">Well, I hope she's at least friendly.</p>
<p id="p-285">So you're saying, oh, that's fine.</p>
<p id="p-286">And then you're thinking, well, actually, I don't, you know, is she nice?</p>
<p id="p-287">It's getting even worse here, right?</p>
<p id="p-288">She's friendly.</p>
<p id="p-289">Oh, well, actually, she sometimes gets frustrated.</p>
<p id="p-290">But still, it's worth it, right?</p>
<p id="p-291">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-292">Then you said, okay, she sounds great.</p>
<p id="p-293">You said, um, truthfully, I'm a little worried about some of what you said.</p>
<p id="p-294">So funny.</p>
<p id="p-295">This conversation is hilarious, right?</p>
<p id="p-296">We're so positive at the beginning.</p>
<p id="p-297">We're trying to keep this nice vibe going between us.</p>
<p id="p-298">And we're trying to be positive about the hairstylist, but she's actually kind of mean.</p>
<p id="p-299">Yeah, Oh, it's funny.</p>
<p id="p-300">All right.</p>
<p id="p-301">So this but this is very real, too, right?</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-302">This is very real too, right?</p>
<p id="p-303">This is real English.</p>
<p id="p-304">This is what native speakers do and I think I just want to make sure this episode is highlighted as one of the more important episodes of the month probably because this is what we do and so this is the gap to become more natural in your conversations, right?</p>
<p id="p-305">Yeah, exactly, exactly.</p>

<p id="p-308">You got it.</p>
<p id="p-309">All right, Michelle, and that kind of is the takeaway.</p>
<p id="p-310">Go and listen to this episode again because it might be the most useful episode for the last couple weeks, right?</p>
