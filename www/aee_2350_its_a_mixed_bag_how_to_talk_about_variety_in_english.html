<p>♪♪ -♪ Go, GX, go! ♪ ♪ GX, go, GX, go! ♪ ♪ GX, go! ♪ -♪♪ -♪♪ Hello, Michelle.</p>
<p>How are you today?</p>
<p>Ah, I'm good, Lindsay.</p>
<p>Lindsay, would you say your friends are all pretty similar, or are they kind of a mixed bag?</p>
<p>Yeah, my friends are kind of a mixed bag, to be honest, because, you know, you gather friends.</p>
<p>Tell me if this is true for you, Michelle.</p>
<p>You gather your friends at different times in your life.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>friends at different times in your life, some in high school, some in childhood, some in college, grad school, living in a city, and so you're a different person at different times, right?</p>
<p>Right, Well, do you have like one bigger group of friends from one period in your life, or would you say it's like, yeah, do you have one larger circle?</p>
<p>No, not really.</p>
<p>I have friends, individual friends collected from different eras of my life who I keep in touch with.</p>
<p>It's rare to have that, I think, throughout, into your adult life, to maintain a group of friends.</p>
<p>I wish I did, but it's more like individuals or two or three people from each era.</p>
<p>Well, that's how it is for me, too.</p>
<p>I mean, I have my two best friends from when I was little, but besides that, it's not really like one larger group.</p>
<p>It's sprinkled all around, but I think that's kind of neat, and also they live in all different places.</p>
<p>I mean, he has friends from other times, too, but he has this really big group.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>this really big group of friends.</p>
<p>They're all amazing from his hometown.</p>
<p>So he has that, but it's interesting because I don't really have that.</p>
<p>I have just more of what you have.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it's more typical what we have.</p>
<p>But I love the question you asked me here because it so encapsulates what I said, right?</p>
<p>A mixed bag.</p>
<p>You said, are they a mixed bag?</p>
<p>Well, that's what we're going to get into today, right, Michelle?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>So this is a really useful expression.</p>
<p>And I was at one party and I had two separate friends use this in one day.</p>
<p>On the same day?</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>On the same day.</p>
<p>Just a few minutes apart.</p>
<p>And you should see me.</p>
<p>It's so funny.</p>
<p>I bet you do this too.</p>
<p>Then all of a sudden I open, I just take a note on my phone.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>You're going to start walking around parties with a little mini notepad.</p>
<p>Yes, I'm a weird person.</p>
<p>Yeah, And sometimes I'll say to them, oh, you just helped me plan an episode of All Ears Angla.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Be sure to listen.</p>
<p>Right, I love it.</p>
<p>So basically what we're saying here guys is you are getting real English.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>You are getting real English, 100% real English, fresh out of Michelle's social life.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>It's so good.</p>
<p>Yeah, So, okay.</p>
<p>Again, the expression is, it's a mixed bag, or it could be, that's a mixed bag or, right, in different ways.</p>
<p>But Lindsay, so what do you think?</p>
<p>Is this something, does this come up in your conversations?</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>I love this expression.</p>
<p>So, it's a mixed bag, meaning we're going to go into the meeting now, but yeah, a lot of different things are thrown into that bag, right?</p>
<p>Everything is not the same, right?</p>
<p>It's not homogenous.</p>
<p>Yeah, What do you think of, it's a mixed bag of?</p>
<p>What do you think, in this, in your mind, well, it just depends on what you're asking about, right?</p>
<p>Because you asked me about my friends.</p>
<p>Yeah, Go ahead.</p>
<p>But like, but like, is there an image you get in your mind of, it's a mixed bag or something like that?</p>
<p>That's funny.</p>
<p>Maybe a grab bag.</p>
<p>Do you know the idea of the grab bag?</p>
<p>When we were kids, sometimes you go to a party and like someone's mom would go around with a bag full of candy or toys and you get to pick from the grab bag.</p>
<p>That's kind of what I think.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>pick from the grab bag.</p>
<p>That's kind of what I think of just a mix of things.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think of a mixed bag of nuts.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Mixed nuts.</p>
<p>Yes, My friends are a bag of mixed nuts.</p>
<p>Yeah, Sometimes I just get an image in my head that goes along with an idiom.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Healthy, very healthy.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>It's a very interesting thing.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So yeah, it means not everything is the same, right?</p>
<p>There's not just one way.</p>
<p>Um, and it can be used to describe many things, right?</p>
<p>Some for how you feel about something to people, to opinions.</p>
<p>Um, to me, tell me if you agree with this.</p>
<p>I think most of the time I hear this when somebody is talking about their opinion or feeling about something.</p>
<p>So like for example, a job, I mean I have a little role play here, so, um, let's do it.</p>
<p>Let's do it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Do you like your new job?</p>
<p>It's a mixed bag.</p>
<p>Some days are great, but some are just okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, I think that's probably true about every job, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it can't always be amazing, right?</p>
<p>There are some things we do at our jobs that we don't love.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>do at our jobs that we don't love for sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, Right, So exactly.</p>
<p>Some good, some bad in this context.</p>
<p>Or let's, Lindsey, maybe you can read this one.</p>
<p>Maybe you identify with this.</p>
<p>I'm the dog lady on the show.</p>
<p>I love the dog lady.</p>
<p>Some of the dogs we met were really sweet, but some were definitely a bit too rowdy for us.</p>
<p>It was a mixed bag.</p>
<p>Yeah, And when you go to adopt a dog in a shelter, I think a lot of our listeners have done this.</p>
<p>You know, you have a lot of different options, right?</p>
<p>You have, you could have some golden retrievers, pit bulls, all sorts of different breeds.</p>
<p>So it's always a mixed bag.</p>
<p>What's out there, what's available.</p>
<p>Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>Or here's another one.</p>
<p>Our home search is a mixed bag, but every time we find something we like, it gets snatched up.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>What a frustrating feeling.</p>
<p>So when you say our home search is a mixed bag, what exactly are you saying, Michelle?</p>
<p>It means you're finding some houses you like, but also a lot of houses you don't like.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>but also a lot of houses you don't like.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, you're expressing this frustration.</p>
<p>It's like, maybe you find a lot of houses, but the ones you actually like don't come through.</p>
<p>Or even the ones you don't like end up getting sold, right?</p>
<p>Sometimes that can happen too.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, yes.</p>
<p>All right, we're gonna take a quick break and then we'll come back and go into more depth about other ways to say this.</p>
<p>All right, Michelle, we are back.</p>
<p>So do we have any other examples here?</p>
<p>Yes, so here's one more is their food is mostly good, but it can be kind of a mixed bag depending on the chef that day.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that's not really a great review for a restaurant, right, Michelle?</p>
<p>You want consistent.</p>
<p>They should be consistent.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure, for sure.</p>
<p>This goes back to, sorry, how we talked about in the beginning about our friends being a mixed bag.</p>
<p>So sometimes it can mean, oh, some good, some bad, some not so great, right, in this mixed bag.</p>
<p>But sometimes it can just mean kind of a variety.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>it can just mean kind of a variety, right Lindsay?</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>So when we say that our friends are a mixed bag, we're not saying some are good, some are bad.</p>
<p>In that case, we're saying they're just different.</p>
<p>They're all very unique people.</p>
<p>They don't fit the same mold.</p>
<p>They don't look the same at all.</p>
<p>I mean, for me, that became very obvious at my wedding.</p>
<p>It was just my wedding party.</p>
<p>Very random, you know, friends that are all very different, but so dear to me, right?</p>
<p>Yes, Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So let's talk about some other, a couple other ways to say this.</p>
<p>What's that first one, Lindsay?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So you could say it varies.</p>
<p>And again, this feels pretty high level to me.</p>
<p>So it varies.</p>
<p>So some of my coworkers are friendly.</p>
<p>Well, some don't want to talk to me at all.</p>
<p>It really varies.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, So you could say it varies.</p>
<p>It really varies.</p>
<p>So usually when you say it varies, I would say it's like a side point, right?</p>
<p>You're kind of saying something and then you're saying it varies, right?</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>and then you're saying, it varies, right?</p>
<p>Right, You're saying it's just different.</p>
<p>It just depends on the day, depends on the person that you're talking to.</p>
<p>Yes, Exactly.</p>
<p>And then also, in a similar vein to our main expression today, you could also say, it's a mix.</p>
<p>Her house is beautiful, but it's a mix.</p>
<p>She does need to get a lot worked on.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And by the way, you just gave me another episode idea, Michelle.</p>
<p>Guys hit the follow button right now in a similar vein.</p>
<p>Have we done that one yet?</p>
<p>That is so high level.</p>
<p>Are we talking about veins in our body?</p>
<p>What are we talking about here?</p>
<p>We're going to come back to it.</p>
<p>So everyone listening today, hit that follow button right now to make sure you don't miss that episode.</p>
<p>That's a good one.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Should we do a role play?</p>
<p>Yeah, let's do it.</p>
<p>So here you are visiting my new home.</p>
<p>Here we are.</p>
<p>This is gorgeous.</p>
<p>So how are your neighbors?</p>
<p>I think mostly friendly, but it's a mixed bag.</p>
<p>Some seem to want to take it easy.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>a mixed bag.</p>
<p>Some seem to want to talk, but others just go about their day and don't really say anything.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Well, how do you like the area?</p>
<p>Well, I like it.</p>
<p>I mean, it varies.</p>
<p>I like certain aspects.</p>
<p>I like the coffee shops, but there aren't many good restaurants here.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>So it's a mix.</p>
<p>Yes, That kind of sounds like my neighborhood currently.</p>
<p>There's some coffee shops.</p>
<p>There's not really that much good food in my neighborhood itself.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>Are you better on coffee shops, restaurants?</p>
<p>Which one is stronger in your area?</p>
<p>I actually would say right now, the restaurants, I'm kind of opposite to you.</p>
<p>We could use a few more.</p>
<p>There's a lot of Starbucks around here.</p>
<p>There's some smaller shops as well, but we could use more.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, Starbucks has its place for sure, but there's nothing better than the local community coffee shop where you walk in and you feel like people are there gathering groups, talking to each other.</p>
<p>It's amazing.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>talking to each other.</p>
<p>It's amazing.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And guys, just as a bonus, you could also say you could say you have mixed feelings or mixed emotions on something.</p>
<p>That's that could be a whole episode in itself for sure.</p>
<p>But that's a good one.</p>
<p>I have mixed feelings about X. All right.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>So Michelle, let's go through a role play and see what we said.</p>
<p>Yes, Okay.</p>
<p>So I said, how are your neighbors?</p>
<p>And you said, I think mostly friendly, but it's a mixed bag.</p>
<p>And then you elaborate and some of them don't even want to talk to you.</p>
<p>Yeah, So you're saying this positively.</p>
<p>They're mostly friendly, but it's a mixed bag.</p>
<p>So some are friendly, some are not friendly.</p>
<p>Some you don't, you don't really know yet.</p>
<p>Right, Sure.</p>
<p>It's just a mixed bag.</p>
<p>And then I said, I like it.</p>
<p>I mean, it varies.</p>
<p>I feel like I'm being very positive at first and then I'm pulling back and I'm mitigating what I've said a little bit.</p>
<p>Yes, Yes, Exactly.</p>
<p>Interesting strategy.</p>
<p>And the way, and the way that you use your rhythm and intonation was really on point there, Lindsay.</p>
<p>You said, I like it.</p>
<p>I mean, it varies, right?</p>
<p>You have to kind of make this pause.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>Right, You have to kind of make this pause.</p>
<p>Right, So that was good.</p>
<p>Yeah, And there's something there for sure, because in American culture, we lead, we tend to want to lead with positivity, optimism and energy.</p>
<p>The good news.</p>
<p>Right, You're not going to argue.</p>
<p>You're not going to say I'm terrible.</p>
<p>Right, But then we might tend to add a little more nuance.</p>
<p>So for our listeners who are interacting with American people in business, for example, listen for that, you know, just because they respond with a huge positive punch at first, there might be a little bit of additional details where you get the truth.</p>
<p>Right, And I think actually that you just gave me an episode idea.</p>
<p>I mean, because that this these transitions like using I mean, right.</p>
<p>And other ways that you can kind of transition to the truth, transition to the truth.</p>
<p>I'm like, I like it.</p>
<p>I mean, because it wouldn't have worked out as quite as well if you just said, I like it.</p>
<p>It varies.</p>
<p>No, that wouldn't make any sense.</p>
<p>You needed a little bridge.</p>
<p>Actually, it would completely change the meaning if I said that.</p>
<p>Right, I would say I like the fact that it</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>that.</p>
<p>I would say I like the fact that it varies.</p>
<p>And that's not what I'm saying, right?</p>
<p>I'm saying I like it.</p>
<p>I mean, it varies.</p>
<p>I'm really changing my mind a little bit or adding the truth.</p>
<p>So yeah, we'll come back to that in another episode.</p>
<p>That's a fun one.</p>
<p>Yeah, Because there are other ways that you can do that.</p>
<p>And other than I mean, yeah, good one.</p>
<p>Good one.</p>
<p>So then I said, oh, so I'm understanding what you're saying.</p>
<p>And I'm kind of just mirroring it.</p>
<p>And I said, oh, okay, so it's a mix.</p>
<p>But it's good what you're doing here.</p>
<p>You're reflecting back and but you're staying positive in your tone of voice.</p>
<p>And you know, you're open to learning more, right?</p>
<p>Because you're going to come over and hang out for sure.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>All right, Michelle.</p>
<p>So we do have results of an important poll that our listeners participated in from what episode was this poll?</p>
<p>Yeah, so this was from episode 2322.</p>
<p>That was do you doom spend connect over this topic in English.</p>
<p>So guys, if you haven't listened to that one already, definitely head on over there.</p>
<p>That was a good one.</p>
<p>And the poll question was, how do you usually pay for</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>how do you usually pay for things?</p>
<p>And the options were cash, credit card, debit card, check, or Venmo or Zelle.</p>
<p>Lindsay, you wanna read the results?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, the top spot went to credit cards, which is not surprising, 47%. Second spot went to cash, which is interesting because we know, I mean, for me, I haven't been using cash for a while, but I think around the world, it's still pretty common.</p>
<p>Obviously it is for our listeners, 31%. And then debit card, 16%, and Venmo, Zelle, 2%, and check, 1%. Remember the days when you'd go to the grocery store and you would watch your mom write a check for groceries?</p>
<p>Yeah, I do.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah, oh, I remember that.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>That's not a thing anymore, Michelle, not a thing.</p>
<p>So credit card is king here.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Yes, And guys, that's a play, what Lindsay just said, because normally the expression is cash is king.</p>
<p>Yes, so she was making a joke and switching it.</p>
<p>We can do an episode on that skill too, Michelle, that big red one too.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>That'd be a good one, too.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>So many ideas.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>Michelle, where should we leave our listeners other than having them hit the follow button so they don't miss these ideas, these new episode ideas?</p>
<p>Yes, Exactly.</p>
<p>So, guys, I mean, this expression, it's a mixed bag.</p>
<p>Something is a mixed bag.</p>
<p>It's a really good way.</p>
<p>I mean, life is a mixed bag, right?</p>
<p>It reminds me of Forrest Gump.</p>
<p>Life is like a box of chocolate.</p>
<p>Guys, if you don't know that reference, you can look it up or watch the movie Forrest Gump.</p>
<p>You know, not everything is going to be the same all the time.</p>
<p>And this is a way to really describe it and kind of be truthful in your opinions or your feelings about something.</p>
<p>So very, very useful.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that's it, Michelle.</p>
<p>That's the key point.</p>
<p>Life is not perfect.</p>
<p>Not everything is amazing and perfect all the time.</p>
<p>There's variety.</p>
<p>There's different people in your life from different eras of your life.</p>
<p>So we need this way to add nuance and shades of gray to what we're saying.</p>
<p>And this is one of the ways to do it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>For better connection.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, thanks so much for chatting about this with me today.</p>
