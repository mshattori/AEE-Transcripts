<p id="p-9">In today's episode, we talk about one way that people deal with negative emotions in American culture.</p>
<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p id="p-10">negative emotions in American culture, which is shopping.</p>
<p id="p-11">Get key vocabulary to talk about this rising trend and learn how to mirror when someone shares this about themselves.</p>
<p id="p-12">♪♪ -♪♪ Hey there, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-13">How are you today?</p>
<p id="p-14">Hi, I'm good.</p>
<p id="p-15">How are you, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-16">Good, good, good.</p>
<p id="p-17">What are we getting into today on All There's English?</p>
<p id="p-18">Lindsay, do you ever buy something when you're in a bad mood?</p>
<p id="p-19">I have to say, this is not where I go when I'm in a bad mood.</p>
<p id="p-20">Yeah,</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-21">when I'm in a bad mood.</p>
<p id="p-22">Yeah, No, I don't. I don't go to retail therapy.</p>
<p id="p-23">Personally.</p>
<p id="p-24">What about you, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-25">Do you have a tendency to buy when you're upset?</p>
<p id="p-26">No, I don't. I don't. I don't think so.</p>
<p id="p-27">I don't think, you know, everybody has their vice.</p>
<p id="p-28">You know, some people, they have a tendency to eat when they're upset.</p>
<p id="p-29">They have, you know, I don't know what I do when I'm upset.</p>
<p id="p-30">But it's not shop.</p>
<p id="p-31">And part of that is just because I'm such a terrible decision maker.</p>
<p id="p-32">So it's not relaxing to me.</p>
<p id="p-33">It's not, you know.</p>
<p id="p-34">Yeah, Yeah, But I suppose if I were looking for a way to forget about something or just want a distraction, I could see going with a friend to the mall and just, you know, walk around like that.</p>
<p id="p-35">But I don't I'm not going to like start just buying things like right.</p>
<p id="p-36">Right, Right, Right, Well, although it is a real thing.</p>
<p id="p-37">I mean, some people definitely do this.</p>
<p id="p-38">And there's even a name for this phenomenon, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-39">What is it?</p>
<p id="p-40">Oh, my gosh.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-41">Well, what is it?</p>
<p id="p-42">Oh my gosh, so this is a new term for it.</p>
<p id="p-43">Guys, we've talked about doom scrolling before, I think, on the podcast.</p>
<p id="p-44">So this is doom spending.</p>
<p id="p-45">Yes, doom spending.</p>
<p id="p-46">And it seems like based on an article we're gonna talk about today and add our opinions and teach you how to do things, it seems like doom spending is having a bit of a resurgence right now, or just spending.</p>
<p id="p-47">And we know that this is kind of a hotspot for Americans.</p>
<p id="p-48">Historically, I mean, as long as I've been able to read the news, I know that credit card debt has been a major problem in the US, especially in the years leading up to the 2008 recession.</p>
<p id="p-49">Our credit card debt was off the charts.</p>
<p id="p-50">And I'm not sure that that caused the recession.</p>
<p id="p-51">Maybe it was a contributing factor.</p>
<p id="p-52">It was mostly for the subprime mortgage lending.</p>
<p id="p-53">But I think once the subprime mortgage lending crashed down, credit card debt didn't help the scenario, right?</p>
<p id="p-54">So we know right now, according to LendingTree.com, we know that Americans total, at this time, right?</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-55">total at this time, right after all the pandemic and everything we've learned, the credit card balance in America is $1.166 trillion in the third quarter of 2024, according to the latest consumer debt data from the Fed, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</p>
<p id="p-56">So that's not a small amount of money, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-57">People are spending money on their credit cards.</p>
<p id="p-58">Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-59">For sure.</p>
<p id="p-60">So very interesting to see what's going on here.</p>
<p id="p-61">So we're going to just touch on this article, give our opinions, and we're going to also give you a lot of good vocabulary to go along with this, to talk about your habits.</p>
<p id="p-62">It's a great conversation topic that our listeners could have with a native speaker, right?</p>
<p id="p-63">Yes, that's right.</p>
<p id="p-64">But guys, before we get into this, we wanted to say thank you so much to our reviewer, to our listener, Amir, for his wonderful review.</p>
<p id="p-65">Yeah, Amir wrote an amazing review in Apple Podcasts on November 12th.</p>
<p id="p-66">He's from the Netherlands.</p>
<p id="p-67">He says, every day I wake up early around</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-68">day, I wake up early around five in the morning and I go to work and there are some essential points to empower me, except for the coldness in Rotterdam.</p>
<p id="p-69">So he's saying that some things help him to deal with the coldness in Rotterdam and he says, coffee, Lindsay and Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-70">You are exactly like fuel, which makes my day energetic and positive.</p>
<p id="p-71">I appreciate you and your excellent team for all your nice efforts and awesome produced content.</p>
<p id="p-72">How amazing, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-73">It's like a little mini Christmas gift early.</p>
<p id="p-74">I know, thank you so much.</p>
<p id="p-75">Seriously, that means a lot to us, Amir.</p>
<p id="p-76">We're so happy to be here for you.</p>
<p id="p-77">You guys are the reason we do this and we really love what we do and we're so happy that we're a part of your day and your fuel.</p>
<p id="p-78">100%. What we do here runs deep for us.</p>
<p id="p-79">This is so important for us to help you all build So if you feel similar to the way Amir feels, go and write your review.</p>
<p id="p-80">Let us know what </p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-81">go and write your review.</p>
<p id="p-82">Let us know what you think about the show.</p>
<p id="p-83">Wherever you're listening, guys, whether it's Apple Podcasts or Spotify or the app, the Android iOS app, leave us a review and we'll read it out loud on the show.</p>
<p id="p-84">All right.</p>
<p id="p-85">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-86">Thank you so, so much.</p>
<p id="p-87">Yes, Okay, Michelle, let's get into doom spending.</p>
<p id="p-88">Doom spending.</p>
<p id="p-89">First of all, what does the word doom mean?</p>
<p id="p-90">Doom.</p>
<p id="p-91">Like something bad.</p>
<p id="p-92">Something bad is happening, right?</p>
<p id="p-93">So doom scrolling, it's kind of your... Well, there's the expression gloom and doom.</p>
<p id="p-94">Oh, right.</p>
<p id="p-95">It's kind of thinking the worst is going to happen, right?</p>
<p id="p-96">So doom is just with a bad feeling, right?</p>
<p id="p-97">Yeah, And I think our listeners probably know the term doom scrolling, but if they don't, it's kind of... It's looking for bad... This comes back to the way the brain, the human brain is wired.</p>
<p id="p-98">The human brain is wired to look for the dangerous thing.</p>
<p id="p-99">We've talked about evolutionary psychology.</p>
<p id="p-100">We know that it's wired to focus on the dangerous, the bad thing.</p>
<p id="p-101">So sometimes when we're...</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-102">bad thing.</p>
<p id="p-103">So sometimes when when we're in a certain mood, we want to go to Instagram or Facebook and look for kind of, I don't know, things that make us feel rotten.</p>
<p id="p-104">Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-105">It's weird, right?</p>
<p id="p-106">I don't think we're thinking of it like that.</p>
<p id="p-107">Oh, I want to find something to make me feel rotten.</p>
<p id="p-108">But you know, it's just that's what happens.</p>
<p id="p-109">It's a Yeah, it's a weird thing.</p>
<p id="p-110">It's human.</p>
<p id="p-111">It's very human.</p>
<p id="p-112">So so today, so then this term doom spending is a play on doom scrolling, right, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-113">Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-114">So doom scrolling has been kind of evolved into really a household term.</p>
<p id="p-115">I mean, to Yeah, I would say that in the beginning, people didn't really know what it meant, or it's really a very new term.</p>
<p id="p-116">So that's interesting how the evolution of language can this is totally new.</p>
<p id="p-117">But doom spending.</p>
<p id="p-118">So like Lindsay said, this is a play on that.</p>
<p id="p-119">So there was an article on huffpost.com by Caroline Bologna on November 8 2020.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-120">on November 8th, 2024.</p>
<p id="p-121">And the article was called, this dangerous money habit is becoming more common.</p>
<p id="p-122">Don't be tempted.</p>
<p id="p-123">Data suggests the 2024 election is fueling a bad impulse.</p>
<p id="p-124">Very interesting.</p>
<p id="p-125">Very interesting.</p>
<p id="p-126">Yeah, okay.</p>
<p id="p-127">So again, so we know what doom spending is.</p>
<p id="p-128">It sounds like people are feeling upset about the election.</p>
<p id="p-129">Yes, they are indeed.</p>
<p id="p-130">And this is what they're doing, right?</p>
<p id="p-131">They're going out and they're just spending money as a way to deal with something that feels really dark emotionally, right?</p>
<p id="p-132">Right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-133">The article mentions that, yeah, it's a doom spending.</p>
<p id="p-134">It's basically retail therapy when people, as they say, feel particularly uneasy and pessimistic about the state of the world.</p>
<p id="p-135">Oh man, where's the good news in today's episode, right?</p>
<p id="p-136">Yes, well, so it does mention that the election, it said leading up to the election could have caused it.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-137">could have caused it and it says that because shopping can give us dopamine, I'm talking about the article here, right?</p>
<p id="p-138">And also, what makes it easy to doomspend?</p>
<p id="p-139">The internet, right?</p>
<p id="p-140">You don't even have to go out anywhere.</p>
<p id="p-141">You can just be in a bad mood and say, I need this, right?</p>
<p id="p-142">Well, that's what I was wondering.</p>
<p id="p-143">Are we talking about physically going into an immersive shopping environment?</p>
<p id="p-144">Are we talking about, is this mostly happening online?</p>
<p id="p-145">Probably online because most people shop online now, right?</p>
<p id="p-146">Yeah, So it's more you're getting that dopamine hit regardless of where you're shopping.</p>
<p id="p-147">Right, And there's no, there's, it's too easy to press that button.</p>
<p id="p-148">It's just too easy.</p>
<p id="p-149">And also then you know you can return it.</p>
<p id="p-150">So, you know, you might, a lot of times return policies are pretty good.</p>
<p id="p-151">So it's probably just easy.</p>
<p id="p-152">It feels very low risk to just press the button and see what happens.</p>
<p id="p-153">But for me, I, when I think about the hassle to go and return something, even just to.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-154">to go and return something, even just to walk over to Whole Foods and put it in the box, it's a big hassle.</p>
<p id="p-155">And it would block me from just randomly buying things because it seems like a lot of work to do that.</p>
<p id="p-156">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-157">It's just not the way I think.</p>
<p id="p-158">Yeah, I totally agree.</p>
<p id="p-159">I absolutely hate having to return things by mail.</p>
<p id="p-160">I mean, I know people, they don't mind, oh, I just had to drop some things off.</p>
<p id="p-161">What happens to me is I forget and I just put it off and then I have things that I don't use because I just never return them.</p>
<p id="p-162">So to me, I do try and be pretty careful about what I buy because I just, I don't know, I think I take it even more seriously than an in-person purchase.</p>
<p id="p-163">Yeah, It's just a lot of work.</p>
<p id="p-164">Things will sit on your countertop ready to be returned for two months and then you miss the deadline.</p>
<p id="p-165">So it's like... Right, Oh, it's terrible.</p>
<p id="p-166">I hate that.</p>
<p id="p-167">Yes, And Lindsay, I just wanted to let our listeners know that towards the end of this episode, we are going to have a poll on Spotify as we've been doing these.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-168">Guys, we've been doing these really, really fun polls to interact with you on Spotify.</p>
<p id="p-169">If you're listening on Spotify, you get a lot of polls and some of them we announce the results.</p>
<p id="p-170">That's right.</p>
<p id="p-171">And we have a good question today, right, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-172">It's going to, it's a very cultural question, right?</p>
<p id="p-173">A practical cultural question about how things vary around the world.</p>
<p id="p-174">So Michelle, is there a quote from the article that would be interesting here for our listeners to know?</p>
<p id="p-175">Yeah, So I thought this was very interesting.</p>
<p id="p-176">Yeah, A recent survey from Credit Karma found that 27% of Americans were doom spending in the lead up to the election, with that number climbing to 37% for Gen Zers and 39% for millennials.</p>
<p id="p-177">And then it says feelings of uncertainty, anxiety and depression are often driving forces.</p>
<p id="p-178">So yeah, this is talking about the lead up to the election and this article came out a couple days after the election.</p>
<p id="p-179">So I'm not sure what's happening right now.</p>
<p id="p-180">Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of people, whether they are.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-181">a lot of people, whether they are excited about the election results or not, they had an intuition of what was going to happen.</p>
<p id="p-182">A lot of people just felt like they knew where things were going to go.</p>
<p id="p-183">And I wonder if this is in any way related to like a hoarding mentality when you think that things are going to get scary.</p>
<p id="p-184">Yeah, like end of the apocalypse situation.</p>
<p id="p-185">I do.</p>
<p id="p-186">I'm not trying to be a psychologist here, but it seems like it could be related to that somehow on like a basic layer, right?</p>
<p id="p-187">That's interesting.</p>
<p id="p-188">Yeah, I did not think of that, but maybe it's possible.</p>
<p id="p-189">It's definitely possible.</p>
<p id="p-190">I mean, so Lindsay, do you know anybody who does doom spend?</p>
<p id="p-191">Not really.</p>
<p id="p-192">No.</p>
<p id="p-193">I think most of the people in my world are more about experiences, honestly.</p>
<p id="p-194">Obviously people shop and buy things, but most people I know I think would rather take that money and just do like a weekend away.</p>
<p id="p-195">And maybe there's a term for that too.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-196">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-197">Right, Right, Yeah, But that's where I land.</p>
<p id="p-198">Yeah, Yes, Same here.</p>
<p id="p-199">I actually think that recently we talked a little bit about this.</p>
<p id="p-200">So probably about, you know, different people and how they spend their money.</p>
<p id="p-201">So yeah, I mean, the article also gives ideas on how to stop doom spending.</p>
<p id="p-202">So we're not going to go over those today.</p>
<p id="p-203">But definitely, we gave you the name of the article.</p>
<p id="p-204">So go check it out if you're interested.</p>
<p id="p-205">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-206">Okay, Michelle, we are back.</p>
<p id="p-207">So now let's talk about how we can actually take a fascinating, fascinating concept like this and turn this into a fantastic conversation, a robust conversation.</p>
<p id="p-208">Right, So we need some vocab first.</p>
<p id="p-209">Yes, Yes, Well, you've already heard us mention today this term retail therapy, retail therapy.</p>
<p id="p-210">So what is that?</p>
<p id="p-211">What is retail?</p>
<p id="p-212">Yeah, I think it's this probably what people are looking for, right at this moment.</p>
<p id="p-213">The idea of healing your mind and heart with buying things.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-214">mind and heart with buying things.</p>
<p id="p-215">Retail is just, you know, buying items for the consumer on a consumer level.</p>
<p id="p-216">So for example, I'm up for some retail therapy now that the election is over.</p>
<p id="p-217">Let's go to the mall.</p>
<p id="p-218">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-219">Yeah, Yep.</p>
<p id="p-220">Or overspend, right?</p>
<p id="p-221">So you have to spend too much, right?</p>
<p id="p-222">I overspent on Prime Day last year, so I'm going to stay away from it this year.</p>
<p id="p-223">Mm-hmm.</p>
<p id="p-224">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-225">Prime Day is always a big one for people for sure.</p>
<p id="p-226">And then we have the term impulse purchase, impulse buy or impulse purchase, right?</p>
<p id="p-227">For example, I was in a bad mood and I saw that these jeans were on sale, so I made an impulse buy.</p>
<p id="p-228">Yeah, Or a compulsive shopping or compulsive shopper.</p>
<p id="p-229">So that's somebody that, I mean, there are people who it can be an actual addiction.</p>
<p id="p-230">Of course.</p>
<p id="p-231">Anything can be an addiction, right?</p>
<p id="p-232">Yes, absolutely.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-233">addiction, right?</p>
<p id="p-234">Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-235">Mm hmm.</p>
<p id="p-236">Oh, you could say I can be a bit of a compulsive shopper when I'm stressed.</p>
<p id="p-237">Mm hmm.</p>
<p id="p-238">Yes, definitely.</p>
<p id="p-239">And then indulgent, right to talk.</p>
<p id="p-240">So saying that something is indulgent.</p>
<p id="p-241">I know it's indulgent, but I bought a car.</p>
<p id="p-242">Yeah, Wow.</p>
<p id="p-243">Yes, Imagine if your spouse comes home, if your spouse deals with things this way, and they buy huge things, not like a $20 pair of socks, but they buy a car.</p>
<p id="p-244">Right, You see that car with a bow in the driveway.</p>
<p id="p-245">You know, it always has a big bow on it.</p>
<p id="p-246">Yeah, that's that's scary.</p>
<p id="p-247">I mean, but things do happen like that.</p>
<p id="p-248">And to be fair, I mean, this is what our culture revolves around.</p>
<p id="p-249">I mean, this is why America, the American economy has gotten so big is because this is I mean, you drive on the highway, you see these ads everywhere right in front of you.</p>
<p id="p-250">We I don't know, this is how we function.</p>
<p id="p-251">Like people buy and buy and buy.</p>
<p id="p-252">It's it's not so different than the average person, you know.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-253">different than the average person, you know, maybe not to this extreme buying a car, but our economy runs on extreme amounts of consumerism.</p>
<p id="p-254">Right?</p>
<p id="p-255">Right, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-256">Yeah, I think we're well known for that.</p>
<p id="p-257">Yes, So we have a good poll on that note, right?</p>
<p id="p-258">Michelle, we have a great poll question today.</p>
<p id="p-259">This is gonna get to this.</p>
<p id="p-260">What is it?</p>
<p id="p-261">The question is, how do you usually pay for things?</p>
<p id="p-262">Is it by cash, credit card, or debit card?</p>
<p id="p-263">Well, I guess we could have put check in there too, but I don't even know if that's- Sure, well, let's put it in there.</p>
<p id="p-264">Let's put check.</p>
<p id="p-265">Let's pay by check.</p>
<p id="p-266">I don't even, do you, have you, when was the last time you paid by check?</p>
<p id="p-267">So sometimes I have to pay by check if it's, do you ever have where there's a big, you have to, okay, let's say something for your house.</p>
<p id="p-268">Yeah, okay.</p>
<p id="p-269">And maybe, I recently had somebody say, oh, there's gonna be a three, you can either pay by cash or card, or you can, you know, but if you pay by card, there's a 3% or 4% fee.</p>
<p id="p-270">Yeah,</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-271">percent or four percent fee.</p>
<p id="p-272">Then I'm going to get out the checkbook.</p>
<p id="p-273">I don't. Oh, right.</p>
<p id="p-274">So there's also, yeah, there's sometimes it's like direct deposit, direct debit out of your account too if you set it up online.</p>
<p id="p-275">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-276">That's how I pay for my daughter's school.</p>
<p id="p-277">But there's also, um, we forgot to mention things like Venmo.</p>
<p id="p-278">Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-279">So let's, okay, we're adding things to the poll right now.</p>
<p id="p-280">There's a lot of ways to pay for things.</p>
<p id="p-281">But I think what this gets down to is, you know, um, I think at least in American culture, as you see people, well, credit card debt is a whole different thing.</p>
<p id="p-282">In the US, if you're paying off your credit card debt every, you're paying off your bill every month, you're not carrying debt, but it gets really dangerous if you're carrying debt over for month to month.</p>
<p id="p-283">Because those percentage rates, that's how people get into a lot of trouble financially.</p>
<p id="p-284">But I know a lot of cultures run more on cash, right?</p>
<p id="p-285">And, and so that means if you have the money, you can buy the thing.</p>
<p id="p-286">If you don't have the money, you can't buy the thing, right?</p>
<p id="p-287">It's a little safer, I think.</p>
<p id="p-288">So I'm curious to see what our listeners have to say.</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p id="p-289">what our listeners have to say.</p>
<p id="p-290">Yeah, Yeah, That'll be interesting.</p>
<p id="p-291">So I guess we could say Venmo or Zelle.</p>
<p id="p-292">I don't know what's popular around the world, but I'll stick Zelle in there.</p>
<p id="p-293">Sure.</p>
<p id="p-294">Zelle, yes.</p>
<p id="p-295">All right.</p>
<p id="p-296">So look out for that poll.</p>
<p id="p-297">It'll be very interesting to see what people say.</p>
<p id="p-298">All right.</p>
<p id="p-299">Let's do a role play, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-300">What do you think?</p>
<p id="p-301">Okay, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-302">Let's do it.</p>
<p id="p-303">So here you and I are stressed out about a project that we're working on at school.</p>
<p id="p-304">So it sounds like we're going to doom shop, right?</p>
<p id="p-305">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-306">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-307">I need to unwind.</p>
<p id="p-308">Should we go for some retail therapy?</p>
<p id="p-309">Oh, yes.</p>
<p id="p-310">But I need to be careful.</p>
<p id="p-311">I did some damage last time.</p>
<p id="p-312">Ooh, did you overspend?</p>
<p id="p-313">You know it.</p>
<p id="p-314">I can be a bit indulgent when I'm stressed.</p>
<p id="p-315">You see this necklace?</p>
<p id="p-316">Total impulse buy after my breakup.</p>
<p id="p-317">Oh, I get it.</p>
<p id="p-318">I'm not usually a compulsive shopper, but I can't help myself these days.</p>
<p id="p-319">All right.</p>
<p id="p-320">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-321">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-322">So we're having a retail therapy conversation here, talking about our own habits and what we've done in the past.</p>
<p id="p-323">Right, </p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p id="p-324">the past.</p>
<p id="p-325">So let's see.</p>
<p id="p-326">So I first said, should we go for some retail therapy?</p>
<p id="p-327">So essentially, I'm inviting you to go shopping together, right?</p>
<p id="p-328">We're stressed out.</p>
<p id="p-329">Yes, Yep.</p>
<p id="p-330">And then guys, this is a extra bonus for today.</p>
<p id="p-331">So I said, I need to be careful.</p>
<p id="p-332">I did some damage last time.</p>
<p id="p-333">Lindsay, do you hear people say I did some damage when they're talking about spending?</p>
<p id="p-334">Sure.</p>
<p id="p-335">And that damage could mean you went home to your partner and they got upset or it could mean you just ran up a credit card debt, debt on your credit card that you can't pay back or something or something.</p>
<p id="p-336">Yeah, It could also just mean you spent a lot.</p>
<p id="p-337">I remember very clearly, um, asking my friend who was on a trip, if she may, if she bought anything, cause she said she was going to go shopping and she said, Oh, we did some damage.</p>
<p id="p-338">So it doesn't, it doesn't necessarily mean actual damage, although it could, but it could, it also just could be a way to kind of in a fun way, say, yeah, we bought a lot.</p>
<p id="p-339">Oh, I did some damage.</p>
<p id="p-340">You did a lot of whatever you were doing.</p>
<h2>Part-21</h2>
<p id="p-341">Yeah, you did a lot of whatever you were doing.</p>
<p id="p-342">Right?</p>
<p id="p-343">Yes, And you have to say it in a certain tone of voice.</p>
<p id="p-344">I did some damage today with a little bit of humor.</p>
<p id="p-345">And then you said, and I asked you, Ooh, did you overspend?</p>
<p id="p-346">Right?</p>
<p id="p-347">And you said, Michelle, I said, you know it.</p>
<p id="p-348">I can be a bit indulgent when I'm stressed.</p>
<p id="p-349">Oh, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-350">And then I said, you see this necklace, right?</p>
<p id="p-351">This was a total impulse buy after my breakup.</p>
<p id="p-352">So I'm, I'm really commiserating with you here.</p>
<p id="p-353">You know, I'm showing empathy.</p>
<p id="p-354">I'm mirroring you.</p>
<p id="p-355">I'm showing an example of when I did the same thing, which is a very high level connection skill, by the way.</p>
<p id="p-356">Definitely, definitely.</p>
<p id="p-357">And then I said, Oh, I get it.</p>
<p id="p-358">I'm not usually a compulsive shopper, but I can't help myself these days.</p>
<p id="p-359">Yeah, And you know what, Michelle, I think that first of all, before we go into the takeaway, let's talk about another episode our listeners could check out if they wanted to.</p>
<p id="p-360">What is that episode?</p>
<p id="p-361">So guys, this is an episode of the Business English.</p>
<h2>Part-22</h2>
<p id="p-362">this is an episode of the Business English podcast.</p>
<p id="p-363">It was episode 343.</p>
<p id="p-364">It was should you use the word restrain or refrain?</p>
<p id="p-365">And I thought about this because we're talking about shopping and maybe we need to restrain ourselves or refrain from going to the mall.</p>
<p id="p-366">So those are also really good words that you can use with this topic.</p>
<p id="p-367">Oh, good, good point, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-368">Good link.</p>
<p id="p-369">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-370">In my mind, I think there's a couple things I want our listeners to take away here.</p>
<p id="p-371">First of all, fascinating topic to track the economy, how people are spending their money, what are the results of the election in our daily habits.</p>
<p id="p-372">And then so this is a conversation you could start if you're just talking about the social phenomenon that's going on.</p>
<p id="p-373">Then I think the connection skill here is what we stumbled on at the end.</p>
<p id="p-374">If someone admits that they are maybe a doom shopper or they're going for some retail therapy, how do we connect with that person, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-375">What do we do?</p>
<p id="p-376">We want to mirror them because it's a little bit vulnerable.</p>
<h2>Part-23</h2>
<p id="p-377">Because it's a little bit vulnerable if you're just saying that you might feel a little awkward sharing it Maybe you feel a little ashamed.</p>
<p id="p-378">What if you could mirror that person and say oh, I've done that too, right?</p>
<p id="p-379">And you know, that's really that could be a whole follow-up episode about you know how that works, but definitely I think that you know, we gave you some of the some of the real stats But what it really comes down to is that connection topic is learning how you guys can talk about it in your daily lives So yeah, when Lindsay said, oh you see this necklace total impulse buy That was a huge connection moment that can bring us closer together because we realize we both kind of do it Sure.</p>
<p id="p-380">Yeah, right, right exactly so I think that that's really the important thing to take away from today's episode is being able to use these things to Not only talk about things like articles but talk with people and connect with them which everybody I I think most people can relate</p>
<h2>Part-24</h2>
<p id="p-381">I think most people can relate to this topic or at least have something to say.</p>
<p id="p-382">Or if it's not shopping, it's something else that you do.</p>
<p id="p-383">Maybe it's eating or exercising too much or watching too much TV.</p>
<p id="p-384">It's something, right?</p>
<p id="p-385">And so we understand that no one is perfect on a human level, even beyond just language.</p>
<p id="p-386">So what we then have to do is find a way to connect, find our similarities, right?</p>
<p id="p-387">This is how we do it.</p>
<p id="p-388">This will be a follow-up episode for sure.</p>
<p id="p-389">I'm going to have fun with this one.</p>
<p id="p-390">All right.</p>
<p id="p-391">Sounds good.</p>
<p id="p-392">Stay tuned guys.</p>
<p id="p-393">We'll see you in the follow-up episode and Michelle, I'll see you soon.</p>
<p id="p-394">All right.</p>
<p id="p-395">Bye, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-396">Bye, guys.</p>
<p id="p-397">All right.</p>
