<p id="p-15">Hey, Michelle, how's it going today? How are you? I'm good.</p>
<p id="p-16">How are you? I'm fantastic today.</p>
<p id="p-17">I have a question to start off the episode.</p>
<p id="p-18">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-19">All right.</p>
<p id="p-20">I'm excited.</p>
<p id="p-21">Did your parents ever tell you about words that you might have missed?</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-22">ever tell you about words that you might have mispronounced when you were a little kid, like silly things you said? Yes, definitely.</p>
<p id="p-23">The first one that comes to mind is I really wanted my ears pierced when I was little.</p>
<p id="p-24">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-25">But I couldn't say earrings, so I called them eenies.</p>
<p id="p-26">Eenies.</p>
<p id="p-27">So I'd say, I want eenies, I want eenies.</p>
<p id="p-28">That's very cute.</p>
<p id="p-29">Oh my God.</p>
<p id="p-30">Yeah, eenies.</p>
<p id="p-31">So to this day, we still talk about eenies.</p>
<p id="p-32">And I was like, oh, I want eenies.</p>
<p id="p-33">Yeah, it becomes like family stories and shared culture, like a shared insider culture within your family, right? It's true.</p>
<p id="p-34">What about you? Any funny ones? Yeah, I used to say cower pitter.</p>
<p id="p-35">So a lot of times kids have a hard time pronouncing the L sound, right? So they'll make that sound, that W sound, very common for kids, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-36">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-37">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-38">So we're going to talk about this today.</p>
<p id="p-39">I'm really excited about this episode.</p>
<p id="p-40">This is pure fun.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-41">excited about this episode.</p>
<p id="p-42">This is pure fun, but it's also an incredible connection topic.</p>
<p id="p-43">So this is going to be a huge episode.</p>
<p id="p-44">Yeah, we're going to talk about some things that kids mispronounce, but that's really not the point.</p>
<p id="p-45">The point is, how do you connect with other parents around these mispronunciations, right? How do you share this with other people, other parents? Because oftentimes I imagine Michelle as a mom or as your husband probably is often around other families and wanting to connect with parents of other kids while your kids are playing.</p>
<p id="p-46">Is that right? Yeah, of course.</p>
<p id="p-47">So this is just, it's so much fun to talk about these things when you're at the playground and you meet another parent, but it's even if you don't have kids, you were a kid, right? So people, this is a conversation topic that just comes up from time to time, even as adults, even if you don't have kids.</p>
<p id="p-48">So don't think, oh, I don't have kids.</p>
<p id="p-49">It's not about me today.</p>
<p id="p-50">You can still have these conversations and so you should be prepared for them because they're fun.</p>
<p id="p-51">No, you're right.</p>
<p id="p-52">It actually does come out when you've heard.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-53">It actually does come out with you for 20, 30, 40 connecting with friends over drinks.</p>
<p id="p-54">It might come up.</p>
<p id="p-55">It totally does.</p>
<p id="p-56">So we're getting into it today.</p>
<p id="p-57">So guys, hit follow because here on All Earth's English, we focus on connection, not perfection.</p>
<p id="p-58">And we look for the connection moment in every episode.</p>
<p id="p-59">We're going to show you what it is today.</p>
<p id="p-60">So Michelle, could you read our question for a change? We'll do something a little different today.</p>
<p id="p-61">Oh, mix that up.</p>
<p id="p-62">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-63">This question is from Barbara.</p>
<p id="p-64">So it says, Dears, I'm Barbara from Treviso, a small city in the north of Italy.</p>
<p id="p-65">Mom of two girls, three years and seven months.</p>
<p id="p-66">Oh, wow.</p>
<p id="p-67">I bet Barbara's busy.</p>
<p id="p-68">I was wondering if you could answer my question.</p>
<p id="p-69">What are the most common words in English mangled by kids? That's a great word.</p>
<p id="p-70">Whoa, excellent word.</p>
<p id="p-71">A really high level, yes.</p>
<p id="p-72">For example, in my, in Italian, my daughter says trige instead of tigre, which is, I'm assuming I'm saying it right, which is tiger.</p>
<p id="p-73">And maybe if you could add some detail.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-74">And maybe if you could add some details about kids' language, baby talk, etc., it would be great.</p>
<p id="p-75">Thanks a lot, Barbara.</p>
<p id="p-76">This is such a different question that is so much fun.</p>
<p id="p-77">I love when we get slightly different, interesting questions that really do apply to our entire audience, even if you're not going to have kids or don't have kids.</p>
<p id="p-78">So let's go through a couple of the things first, Michelle, that kids do mess up.</p>
<p id="p-79">I mean, they do mangle sometimes, by the way, fantastic word, right? That's going to be a key word for today.</p>
<p id="p-80">Again, what does it mean? Just to define it again? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-81">To mess up.</p>
<p id="p-82">Destroy.</p>
<p id="p-83">Destroy.</p>
<p id="p-84">It's kind of an extreme form of messing up, right? Mangle, ruin, completely destroy.</p>
<p id="p-85">Certain words.</p>
<p id="p-86">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-87">So to me, when I hear this, the first one that comes to mind, I don't know, Lindsay, if you've heard this, is instead of saying spaghetti, a lot of kids, including my kids,</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-88">A lot of kids, including my kids, say basketty.</p>
<p id="p-89">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-90">Oh, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-91">Yeah, that definitely sounds familiar.</p>
<p id="p-92">That is something I feel I probably would have said as a kid.</p>
<p id="p-93">Right, So it's tough.</p>
<p id="p-94">It's tough if you get spaghetti.</p>
<p id="p-95">It's a little bit of a toughie.</p>
<p id="p-96">So basketty for a while until they learn spaghetti.</p>
<p id="p-97">And as I said earlier, the next one, the LW sound can get really confusing.</p>
<p id="p-98">Right, So let's see.</p>
<p id="p-99">What does your son say? Well, when he was little, instead of calling water water, he would sometimes say Lada or Lodi.</p>
<p id="p-100">And yeah, or he had a teacher named Gladys and he would call her Gwadis.</p>
<p id="p-101">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-102">But I loved the Lodi thing because it was it didn't.</p>
<p id="p-103">I don't know how that came to be.</p>
<p id="p-104">But even it's very good to this day.</p>
<p id="p-105">Now he can say water.</p>
<p id="p-106">But we always will say Lodi.</p>
<p id="p-107">He would come up to me, run up to me, more Lodi, more Lodi.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-108">me more lovely, more lovely.</p>
<p id="p-109">That's very cute.</p>
<p id="p-110">That's very cute.</p>
<p id="p-111">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-112">And then hand sanitizer Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-113">Oh, they combine it.</p>
<p id="p-114">That is so smart.</p>
<p id="p-115">Actually, I love that.</p>
<p id="p-116">I like it too.</p>
<p id="p-117">I might take that.</p>
<p id="p-118">So yeah, so my son did this.</p>
<p id="p-119">But also I've been reading in other when I was doing research for this, I saw that this was a common one.</p>
<p id="p-120">Instead of saying hand sanitizer, they say handitizer.</p>
<p id="p-121">Brilliant, brilliant.</p>
<p id="p-122">I will that as a maybe start a company selling hand sanitizer one day.</p>
<p id="p-123">We'll see.</p>
<p id="p-124">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-125">And then and then my daughter she instead of she would have trouble saying the cuh.</p>
<p id="p-126">So she would make it a huh.</p>
<p id="p-127">So she instead of saying, Come on, come on, she would say, Come on, come on.</p>
<p id="p-128">Oh, cute.</p>
<p id="p-129">Those are cute ones.</p>
<p id="p-130">Any any that you others that you remember, or maybe one for your niece? Or I know there are some I know there were others.</p>
<p id="p-131">The only one that comes</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-132">I know there were others.</p>
<p id="p-133">The only one that comes to mind is the cow or pitter.</p>
<p id="p-134">And there's another one.</p>
<p id="p-135">And I just can't think of it because there were two that my dad used to make fun of me for together.</p>
<p id="p-136">And I just can't think of the other one.</p>
<p id="p-137">So long ago, Michelle, honestly.</p>
<p id="p-138">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-139">I mean, Lindsay, why do you think this is a good connection topic? Well, because it's all about telling stories.</p>
<p id="p-140">Connection is about telling stories that someone else is going to relate to.</p>
<p id="p-141">And our goal here is to be able to do that in English if we're living abroad or if we're just speaking in English with a native speaker.</p>
<p id="p-142">So that's what we're going to get into after the break, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-143">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-144">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-145">All right.</p>
<p id="p-146">OK, so we are back from the break.</p>
<p id="p-147">And let's talk about how we could turn these little these little pieces into a connection moment, these little stories of what your kids are saying or what you used to say.</p>
<p id="p-148">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-149">Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-150">So we have a couple of different contexts here.</p>
<p id="p-151">So the first one is to share.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-152">here.</p>
<p id="p-153">So, the first one is to share about someone else.</p>
<p id="p-154">So, Lindsay, could you give us the first example? Yes, So, we could say, my son or daughter or niece or nephew calls XY.</p>
<p id="p-155">So, for example, my son calls spaghetti, bischetti.</p>
<p id="p-156">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-157">Right, Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-158">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-159">They call XY.</p>
<p id="p-160">That's also kind of cool.</p>
<p id="p-161">Yes, Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-162">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-163">So, if you're somewhere in some silly Italian restaurant or something, spaghetti, bischetti.</p>
<p id="p-164">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-165">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-166">Or you could say it like this, my son, daughter, niece, nephew, whoever it is, a child you have a connection with, says X instead of Y.</p>
<p id="p-167">So, instead of calls XY, here we're saying says X instead of Y.</p>
<p id="p-168">So, of course, X is the incorrect way and Y is the correct way.</p>
<p id="p-169">So, for example, my daughter says hannitizer instead of hand sanitizer.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-170">sanitizer.</p>
<p id="p-171">And it's very cute.</p>
<p id="p-172">I mean, these are the things that we love about our kids, our nieces and nephews, right? These are the little personality quirks that, you know, is so endearing or very endearing.</p>
<p id="p-173">But then we could also talk about ourselves, right? Right, Which is interesting because this honestly does come up, Michelle, among friends.</p>
<p id="p-174">It does.</p>
<p id="p-175">It does.</p>
<p id="p-176">So, Lindsay, what's one thing you could say about yourself? So you could say, when I was a kid, I would say X instead of Y.</p>
<p id="p-177">It's interesting that we're using would there.</p>
<p id="p-178">What do we use would for instead of I said X instead of Y? What do you think? What's the subtle difference, grammatically speaking? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-179">Instead of saying I said X instead of Y.</p>
<p id="p-180">I'm trying to think of why specifically we would do that.</p>
<p id="p-181">Lindsay, any thoughts? Well, it seems to me like it's you're telling, talking about a habit that you had.</p>
<p id="p-182">Something that you would do repetitively.</p>
<p id="p-183">If I said, when I was a kid, I said X instead of Y.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-184">When I was a kid, I said X instead of Y.</p>
<p id="p-185">It actually does imply it's a habit, but it also could have been once.</p>
<p id="p-186">If I want to be very clear, it was a repetitive habit, I would say X instead of Y.</p>
<p id="p-187">Yes, Good point.</p>
<p id="p-188">Okay, good.</p>
<p id="p-189">I'm glad that you brought that up.</p>
<p id="p-190">That's very good.</p>
<p id="p-191">Or another thing.</p>
<p id="p-192">Oh, so what's the example there? Okay, so I think you better do that, Richelle, because that's true.</p>
<p id="p-193">Okay, when I was a kid, I would say Eanies instead of earrings.</p>
<p id="p-194">Nice, nice.</p>
<p id="p-195">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-196">And then next one, you could say, my parents told me I couldn't say the blank sound, so I called X Y.</p>
<p id="p-197">Okay, so what does that look like, Richelle, in an example? Okay, my parents told me I couldn't say the L sound, so I called my sister Laura, Wara.</p>
<p id="p-198">I'm not sure when that goes away.</p>
<p id="p-199">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-200">We don't teach kids here at All ears English, so we don't really know exactly when that goes away, but it's a good question.</p>
<p id="p-201">Do you have a sense?</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-202">But it's a good question.</p>
<p id="p-203">Do you have a sense? I mean, I would say, I was trying to listen to how my son speaks.</p>
<p id="p-204">I think a lot of it has gone away.</p>
<p id="p-205">The LW specifically, but there are times when I'll hear still he's he'll be six in November.</p>
<p id="p-206">And there are times when I still hear a slight, you know, incorrect pronunciation or something like that.</p>
<p id="p-207">But I would say four or five or when things and it's so funny, because it happens so suddenly, it happens all of a sudden, you realize one day, you know, my daughter would say to me, come on.</p>
<p id="p-208">And then all of a sudden, she just said, Come on, mommy.</p>
<p id="p-209">And that's so moment.</p>
<p id="p-210">There's this moment as a parent where you're so happy, like, wow, oh, my gosh, you did it.</p>
<p id="p-211">And then there's also a little bit of sadness.</p>
<p id="p-212">Oh, that's cool.</p>
<p id="p-213">That must be cool to watch that in real time happening.</p>
<p id="p-214">Right?</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-215">time.</p>
<p id="p-216">Happening, right? That change.</p>
<p id="p-217">I think so many of our listeners are going to be able to relate to that.</p>
<p id="p-218">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-219">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-220">But there's a little bit of, oh, sometimes, oh, so actually one that my son says instead of, oh, I broke something, he would say, I broke it.</p>
<p id="p-221">And he still says it to this day.</p>
<p id="p-222">And I'll say, don't correct him.</p>
<p id="p-223">I like it.</p>
<p id="p-224">But then Dan says, no, he's going to be, we have to correct.</p>
<p id="p-225">He's going to be in high school saying, no, we don't want that.</p>
<p id="p-226">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-227">You probably do have to correct it.</p>
<p id="p-228">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-229">Probably.</p>
<p id="p-230">It's probably the best thing.</p>
<p id="p-231">But the cool thing about this is we can get nicknames that can come out of this, right? Or siblings could bond over maybe later in life.</p>
<p id="p-232">You still call something a certain way.</p>
<p id="p-233">Right? Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-234">I mean, even when I was little, um, I, my mom said that I would get on the phone with my grandparents and I would say, um, damma, that's what I called grandma.</p>
<p id="p-235">Uh, and I would say, wanna talk to Tampa da minute.</p>
<p id="p-236">So gamma, damma and Tampa.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-237">of Dama and Tampa.</p>
<p id="p-238">So there are things that they just come up and you never forget them.</p>
<p id="p-239">And it's a part of your family history.</p>
<p id="p-240">And maybe it becomes the name.</p>
<p id="p-241">We did an episode.</p>
<p id="p-242">I think you and I did that episode, right? Or was it Aubrey and I? I can never remember which ones you and I recorded or Aubrey and I.</p>
<p id="p-243">But anyways, there was an episode about what you call your grandparent.</p>
<p id="p-244">Yes, that was me.</p>
<p id="p-245">Yes, you and I did that one together.</p>
<p id="p-246">And that could go into that too, right? So Michelle, let's do a role play then about how this looks.</p>
<p id="p-247">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-248">Okay, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-249">So in this role play, sorry, I had to scroll down to it.</p>
<p id="p-250">We are talking about our kids.</p>
<p id="p-251">Okay, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-252">Yes, Stevie has started doing the funniest thing.</p>
<p id="p-253">He calls turtles furples.</p>
<p id="p-254">That's adorable.</p>
<p id="p-255">Janie says papa instead of pasta.</p>
<p id="p-256">Adorable.</p>
<p id="p-257">My parents told me I couldn't say the S sound.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-258">My parents told me I couldn't say the S sound, so I called my sister Steffy Teffy.</p>
<p id="p-259">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-260">Very typical.</p>
<p id="p-261">And also what it would look like if you're just talking about your own weird habits as a kid would be very similar to this role play, right? Yes, Yes, Do we go back and take a look at it, Michelle? Let's do it.</p>
<p id="p-262">All right.</p>
<p id="p-263">So here, first thing you said was Stevie has started doing the funniest thing.</p>
<p id="p-264">That's an interesting way to open a conversation.</p>
<p id="p-265">We could talk about that another day on All Ears English, guys.</p>
<p id="p-266">Hit that follow button.</p>
<p id="p-267">But you said he calls turtles furples.</p>
<p id="p-268">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-269">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-270">He calls X, Y, right? And then you said that's adorable.</p>
<p id="p-271">And then you said Janie says papa instead of pasta.</p>
<p id="p-272">So something instead of the correct thing.</p>
<p id="p-273">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-274">And then you said my parents told me I couldn't say the S sound, so I called my sister Stephanie .</p>
<p id="p-275">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-276">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-277">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-278">Yeah.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-279">My sister Stephanie Stephanie Teffy.</p>
<p id="p-280">Yeah, that's cute.</p>
<p id="p-281">That sounds very typical, right? Yes Wow, good topic great question from our amazing listener.</p>
<p id="p-282">We love your questions guys Thank you to Barbara for that question.</p>
<p id="p-283">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-284">Yeah This is this has been a really fun one and guys if you want to listen to another really fun episode We just did recently episode 2273.</p>
<p id="p-285">That was wacky English vocabulary for fun Conversation so after you finish with this one go on over and listen to that one.</p>
<p id="p-286">Well, Michelle What do you think is the takeaway today for our listeners? Where should we leave them leave them in terms of connection? What should we remember? That this is all about storytelling.</p>
<p id="p-287">Like you said in the beginning.</p>
<p id="p-288">This is not about oh, I have kids I can talk about this.</p>
<p id="p-289">If you don't have kids you can't relate.</p>
