<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p id="p-10">In this part two of our two-part series, learn four classic phrases that include alliteration to use both literally and abstractly in English.</p>
<p id="p-11">Hey, Aubrey, question for you today.</p>
<p id="p-12">All right, let's hear it.</p>
<p id="p-13">So do you drive a gas guzzler?</p>
<p id="p-14">Oh, I do drive an SUV that is a bit of a gas guzzler.</p>
<p id="p-15">I drive it as seldom as possible, and then I have an electric vehicle that I try to drive as much as possible to save gas.</p>
<p id="p-16">Oh, my God.</p>
<p id="p-17">I definitely drive a gas guzzler.</p>
<p id="p-18">I drive an old Toyota 4Runner from 2006.</p>
<p id="p-19">Oh, man.</p>
<p id="p-20">Supreme gas guzzler.</p>
<p id="p-21">Yeah, What is a gas guzzler, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-22">What is that?</p>
<p id="p-23">Yeah, a gas guzzler is a car that just guzzles up so much gas, just consumes gas very quickly.</p>
<p id="p-24">And when gas prices are up, we can feel it for sure.</p>
<p id="p-25">Seriously.</p>
<p id="p-26">Yes, this is a car that is not fuel efficient.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-27">This is a car that is not fuel-efficient.</p>
<p id="p-28">So when you go to fill the tank, first of all, you're filling it very often, and then it goes through gas really quickly.</p>
<p id="p-29">So especially older cars, right?</p>
<p id="p-30">They're more fuel-efficient these days.</p>
<p id="p-31">The older cars, oof, bad.</p>
<p id="p-32">Yeah, I didn't realize it, but SUVs have gotten a lot more fuel-efficient, you know?</p>
<p id="p-33">Yes, They really have.</p>
<p id="p-34">Especially a lot of even hybrids, electric vehicles that are SUVs.</p>
<p id="p-35">It's amazing the power they're able to get with those these days.</p>
<p id="p-36">Yeah, It's impressive.</p>
<p id="p-37">It's impressive.</p>
<p id="p-38">So how does this tie into the topic today, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-39">Yes, go ahead.</p>
<p id="p-40">Yes, We are talking about idioms that have alliteration.</p>
<p id="p-41">We did a part one on the Business English podcast, Stay to the End, and we'll let you know which episode that was if you missed it.</p>
<p id="p-42">You don't have to have heard that one to understand this one.</p>
<p id="p-43">Today, we're sharing idioms that also have alliteration that we use in everyday conversations.</p>
<p id="p-44">Yeah, In the other episode, we talked about how these are just fun to say, they're punchy, they sound smooth.</p>
<p id="p-45">They're just fun and kind of funny at times.</p>
<p id="p-46">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-47">Alliteration is when you have a repeated sound, like</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-48">Alliteration is when you have a repeated sound, like in Gas Guzzler, we have that hard G sound twice.</p>
<p id="p-49">And it does make it fun to say.</p>
<p id="p-50">So idioms, I mean, they're fun enough on their own.</p>
<p id="p-51">Add alliteration.</p>
<p id="p-52">Yes, Oh, whammy.</p>
<p id="p-53">It's another tool, right?</p>
<p id="p-54">Especially as our listeners get into B2C1.</p>
<p id="p-55">In our C1 course, we talk about speaking in metaphors.</p>
<p id="p-56">This could be another tool, speaking with alliteration.</p>
<p id="p-57">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-58">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-59">Yeah, Okay.</p>
<p id="p-60">Super interesting.</p>
<p id="p-61">All right.</p>
<p id="p-62">So let's go into number one, which is Gas Guzzler.</p>
<p id="p-63">We've already shared what it means.</p>
<p id="p-64">Let's share a couple more examples here.</p>
<p id="p-65">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-66">Here's one.</p>
<p id="p-67">This car is a real gas guzzler.</p>
<p id="p-68">Right?</p>
<p id="p-69">And my Toyota 4Runner is definitely a real gas guzzler.</p>
<p id="p-70">Yes, Yes, And this is not a compliment, right?</p>
<p id="p-71">This is a complaint.</p>
<p id="p-72">This is someone complaining about their car.</p>
<p id="p-73">That's right.</p>
<p id="p-74">What was another one, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-75">You might say, I'm shopping for a more fuel efficient car.</p>
<p id="p-76">I'm tired of driving a gas guzzler.</p>
<p id="p-77">And this is just the phrase, this phrase, everyone knows it, right?</p>
<p id="p-78">Native speakers just know it.</p>
<p id="p-79">And so to learn it and to be able to start using it, we'll just...</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-80">learn it and to be able to start using it will just feel natural.</p>
<p id="p-81">You know, people will just recognize it when you say it.</p>
<p id="p-82">Yeah, Yes, And it's really interesting.</p>
<p id="p-83">It's amazing how much that alliteration makes it more playful.</p>
<p id="p-84">Because if you're going to say, you know, Oh, I want a more fuel efficient car, it's fun and informal and playful to say, Oh, I don't want to drive a gas guzzler.</p>
<p id="p-85">Yeah, You know, if we said that, I mean, it's not wrong.</p>
<p id="p-86">It's fine.</p>
<p id="p-87">But sometimes, I don't know, it can feel something saying that would feel kind of formal kind of distant kind of adds a distance.</p>
<p id="p-88">And just, you know, using idioms and slaying a span alliteration, it closes that distance and makes this connection closer.</p>
<p id="p-89">Oh, I think that's the topic today, right?</p>
<p id="p-90">How to close the distance using alliteration.</p>
<p id="p-91">That's right there.</p>
<p id="p-92">Yeah, So, Aubrey, what's our second one?</p>
<p id="p-93">This one feels a little older to me.</p>
<p id="p-94">Yeah, this is my parents said this a lot.</p>
<p id="p-95">It's get your goat, which means to like bother or annoy.</p>
<p id="p-96">And whenever my brother would do something annoying,</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-97">my brother would do something annoying and I would complain about him.</p>
<p id="p-98">My mom especially would say, why do you let him get your goat?</p>
<p id="p-99">That meant like, why do you let him bother you?</p>
<p id="p-100">Why do you care?</p>
<p id="p-101">Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-102">Were you and your brother close in age or how far apart in age are you?</p>
<p id="p-103">Yes, A couple years apart.</p>
<p id="p-104">I'm actually going to see him on Thanksgiving in a few days.</p>
<p id="p-105">I'm very excited.</p>
<p id="p-106">That's awesome.</p>
<p id="p-107">But we really were at fist to cuffs as kids.</p>
<p id="p-108">You heard that phrase?</p>
<p id="p-109">We were just always fighting, always arguing.</p>
<p id="p-110">Yeah, My brother and I were the same way.</p>
<p id="p-111">We're two and a half years apart.</p>
<p id="p-112">He's two and a half years younger, but I think that age difference is really, really, you know... Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-113">That's exactly what we are.</p>
<p id="p-114">He's two and a half years younger than me.</p>
<p id="p-115">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-116">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-117">The fighting is intense when you're a kid.</p>
<p id="p-118">So let's see.</p>
<p id="p-119">What is another sample sentence?</p>
<p id="p-120">Yeah?</p>
<p id="p-121">So you might say about somebody, that guy really gets my goat, right?</p>
<p id="p-122">Or that lady really gets my goat.</p>
<p id="p-123">And this is a more informal, playful way of saying they really bother me.</p>
<p id="p-124">They really annoy me, which that is a phrase that you want to kind of take some of the ire out of.</p>
<p id="p-125">You want to make it...</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-126">the ire out of.</p>
<p id="p-127">You want to make it more playful because otherwise it's like you're being too serious about it or you're like, you know, it's not a good look to get really annoyed.</p>
<p id="p-128">Yeah, What are you going to say?</p>
<p id="p-129">I really hate that person.</p>
<p id="p-130">No, right.</p>
<p id="p-131">You need something else to say to kind of, yeah, to lighten it, to lighten it and make it diffuse what you're saying a little bit.</p>
<p id="p-132">Yeah, Yeah, And this is a little less common.</p>
<p id="p-133">I think you're right.</p>
<p id="p-134">You're kind of feeling like it's maybe a little older, maybe the generation older than us used it more.</p>
<p id="p-135">I do still hear it.</p>
<p id="p-136">I think you guys will hear it on TV podcasts, but a little less common.</p>
<p id="p-137">Yeah, I still hear, I think my grandmother used to say it, but I still hear it for sure.</p>
<p id="p-138">So it lives on.</p>
<p id="p-139">It lives on.</p>
<p id="p-140">I hope it will.</p>
<p id="p-141">It's fun.</p>
<p id="p-142">And the alliteration, get your goat.</p>
<p id="p-143">So fun.</p>
<p id="p-144">And number three is make a mountain out of a molehill.</p>
<p id="p-145">This one is also still very common, although it may be a little bit older to make a big deal out of something small.</p>
<p id="p-146">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-147">So you might say I'm upset she's late, but I'm trying not to make a mountain out of a molehill.</p>
<p id="p-148">You're like, I'm trying to be chill.</p>
<p id="p-149">I'm trying not to make a big deal out of something.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-150">I'm trying not to make a big deal out of something that's really not a big deal.</p>
<p id="p-151">Right, To not be so dramatic.</p>
<p id="p-152">Right?</p>
<p id="p-153">Take the drama out of life a little bit.</p>
<p id="p-154">Yeah, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-155">Yes, Or you might say about someone.</p>
<p id="p-156">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-157">He's making a mountain out of a molehill.</p>
<p id="p-158">This really wasn't a big deal.</p>
<p id="p-159">Right?</p>
<p id="p-160">So, and that is if you're saying this about someone, you're trying to share that they're being too dramatic.</p>
<p id="p-161">Like you said, Lindsay, this is a good way to lighten it up a little bit.</p>
<p id="p-162">Do you know anyone, Aubrey, that tends to do this?</p>
<p id="p-163">They just kind of go full speed into feeling everything with intense drama?</p>
<p id="p-164">Probably me.</p>
<p id="p-165">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-166">I can't think of anyone who does this more than I do.</p>
<p id="p-167">Maybe I do too.</p>
<p id="p-168">I know actually all.</p>
<p id="p-169">It depends on the situation sometimes, you know, but I know I've mentioned on the podcast before that if I feel like someone's being treated unfairly, I'm like zero to 60.</p>
<p id="p-170">I'm right there in someone's face, like defending someone, maybe making a mountain out of a molehill sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-171">Right, Right, Yeah, It depends on who, for me, it depends on who I'm around.</p>
<p id="p-172">Like if I'm around my partner, I feel more liberty to be dramatic.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-173">or I feel more liberty to be dramatic.</p>
<p id="p-174">Totally, right?</p>
<p id="p-175">You're in a safe place.</p>
<p id="p-176">Yes, you know, just a friend that maybe I don't know as well.</p>
<p id="p-177">Among strangers, I might be a little more reserved.</p>
<p id="p-178">That's a good point.</p>
<p id="p-179">A little more easy going.</p>
<p id="p-180">Yeah, yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-181">So our personalities change depending on who we're around, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-182">Oh my gosh, okay, pleased as punch.</p>
<p id="p-183">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-184">Also feels classic.</p>
<p id="p-185">Let's call it classic.</p>
<p id="p-186">They are all pretty classic, right?</p>
<p id="p-187">We've definitely heard our grandparents use these.</p>
<p id="p-188">We've seen them on older TV shows, but we do still hear them some.</p>
<p id="p-189">So this means very happy, to be pleased as punch.</p>
<p id="p-190">Yeah, so here's an example.</p>
<p id="p-191">I'm just pleased as punch about the present you got me.</p>
<p id="p-192">I feel like I should say that in a Southern accent for some reason.</p>
<p id="p-193">I don't know why.</p>
<p id="p-194">Or like imitate a cute little grandma.</p>
<p id="p-195">Yeah, that's true.</p>
<p id="p-196">Or you might say, he looks pleased as punch.</p>
<p id="p-197">Something really good must have happened.</p>
<p id="p-198">I think we often, at least our generation and younger, we often use this to be a little more silly, right?</p>
<p id="p-199">Where like, don't you just look pleased?</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-200">We're like, don't you just look pleased as punch, and we're almost teasing them for being so happy about something.</p>
<p id="p-201">So you're saying you're not necessarily using it in a fully serious way, right?</p>
<p id="p-202">Yeah, I feel like this is when I use it the most, and it's that chunk.</p>
<p id="p-203">If I see that someone's just giddy, like super happy, especially if it's something really little and silly, then I'll say, don't you just look pleased as punch.</p>
<p id="p-204">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-205">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-206">Yeah, I mean, sometimes older phrases that have been around, we heard our grandparents use, we use them still, but we use them in a more figurative way or a fun, sarcastic way.</p>
<p id="p-207">They love teasing.</p>
<p id="p-208">Yeah, Almost like we're imitating our grandparents saying it to us.</p>
<p id="p-209">Yes, Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-210">Huh.</p>
<p id="p-211">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-212">Good to know, though.</p>
<p id="p-213">Good to know.</p>
<p id="p-214">So in this role play, which we're going to go into right now, after we take a quick break, let's take a quick break, Aubrey, and then we'll be right back.</p>
<p id="p-215">Awesome.</p>
<p id="p-216">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-217">We are back from break.</p>
<p id="p-218">Here in this role play, you work at a car dealership, and I'm shopping for a new car.</p>
<p id="p-219">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-220">Let's do it.</p>
<p id="p-221">You want to start us out?</p>
<p id="p-222">Yes, Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-223">All right.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-224">Yes, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-225">All right, can you tell me how many miles per gallon this car gets?</p>
<p id="p-226">I don't want a gas guzzler.</p>
<p id="p-227">I know what you mean.</p>
<p id="p-228">It really gets my goat when you see that gas gauge dropping so fast.</p>
<p id="p-229">Yes, not to make a mountain out of a molehill, but I definitely want to avoid that.</p>
<p id="p-230">Well, I think you'll be pleased as punch with this one.</p>
<p id="p-231">It gets 30 miles per gallon on the highway and 25 in town.</p>
<p id="p-232">I would make a good car salesman.</p>
<p id="p-233">Yes, I know, you don't drive your soul out of a bargain.</p>
<p id="p-234">I know, it's just like, talk about the features, talk about the efficiency of the car.</p>
<p id="p-235">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-236">Exactly, right?</p>
<p id="p-237">All right, so here, I said, can you tell me how many miles per gallon this car gets?</p>
<p id="p-238">And I said, I don't want a gas guzzler.</p>
<p id="p-239">And that was the car that tends to use gas quickly.</p>
<p id="p-240">It just absorbs it.</p>
<p id="p-241">Exactly, and we didn't really talk about the actual verb guzzle means to drink very fast.</p>
<p id="p-242">We'll say this like someone could guzzle a soda.</p>
<p id="p-243">It means you're like drinking something really fast.</p>
<p id="p-244">So this is very idiomatic.</p>
<p id="p-245">It's sort of personification to say.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-246">It's sort of personification to say that the car is drinking the gas quickly.</p>
<p id="p-247">It is.</p>
<p id="p-248">Cool.</p>
<p id="p-249">Kind of creative, right?</p>
<p id="p-250">Yeah, Fun.</p>
<p id="p-251">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-252">And then what if you said, oh yeah, it really gets my goat when you see that gas gauge dropping.</p>
<p id="p-253">So this is a fun way to use it.</p>
<p id="p-254">I am showing empathy to you.</p>
<p id="p-255">I get it.</p>
<p id="p-256">I also hate driving a gas guzzler.</p>
<p id="p-257">And so then I can say, yeah, that really gets my goat.</p>
<p id="p-258">That also really bothers me.</p>
<p id="p-259">And also a good sales skill, right?</p>
<p id="p-260">In order to sell, people have to feel that you understand them with empathy.</p>
<p id="p-261">And you do.</p>
<p id="p-262">You're genuine here, right?</p>
<p id="p-263">It's true.</p>
<p id="p-264">I missed my calling as a car salesman.</p>
<p id="p-265">Salesperson.</p>
<p id="p-266">Would have been a different life for sure.</p>
<p id="p-267">Yeah, it would have.</p>
<p id="p-268">And then I said, yes, not to make a mountain out of a molehill, but I definitely want to avoid that.</p>
<p id="p-269">So I'm saying I'm not trying to be dramatic or make a really huge deal out of this one goal of the car, but I don't want it, right?</p>
<p id="p-270">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-271">Right, So I'm saying a little to not seem dramatic, not seem picky, like, oh, I'm not trying to be dramatic.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-272">picky like, Oh, I'm not trying to be driven.</p>
<p id="p-273">I'm not trying to make a mountain out of a molehill.</p>
<p id="p-274">But you know, this is an important feature to me.</p>
<p id="p-275">You have to say what you're looking for when you're in the market for anything, right?</p>
<p id="p-276">Yes, Yeah, And then I finished by saying, I think you'll be pleased as punch with this one.</p>
<p id="p-277">And this, I could see myself saying this, even in this kind of situation and be like, it means the same as I think you're really going to love this other one.</p>
<p id="p-278">I'm going to show you, but it's a little more playful.</p>
<p id="p-279">Yeah, I'd be pleased as punch with this one.</p>
<p id="p-280">Yeah, And this is used in a more straightforward way, right?</p>
<p id="p-281">Cause it's just a sales deal and you don't know the person.</p>
<p id="p-282">So it's being used in the way that maybe our parents' generation used it or our grandparents.</p>
<p id="p-283">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-284">And this is interesting to look at this role play because a lot of you out there might think you need to reserve idioms and slaying for like friends, close friends, very informal conversations, right here.</p>
<p id="p-285">We're, you know, a salesperson and someone buying a car, we don't know each other.</p>
<p id="p-286">Well, it's a little more of a formal situation and it still doesn't feel strange to be throwing in idioms because it just is very native and natural.</p>
<p id="p-287">It's still.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-288">native and natural.</p>
<p id="p-289">It's still a pretty informal conversation if you're shopping for a car.</p>
<p id="p-290">Oh, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-291">There are so many contexts for idioms and expressions and slang phrases.</p>
<p id="p-292">So it's not just those close friends.</p>
<p id="p-293">100% agree.</p>
<p id="p-294">So let's send our listeners to the first episode in this series.</p>
<p id="p-295">Aubrey, what episode was that?</p>
<p id="p-296">Yes, it was episode 349 on the Business English Podcast called Amazing Alliteration.</p>
<p id="p-297">Commit these sticky phrases to memory.</p>
<p id="p-298">And we talked a little more about alliteration and how it's used by brands to make things memorable.</p>
