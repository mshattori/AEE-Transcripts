<p id="p-19">Lindsay, if we're all set up, what should we do then?</p>
<p id="p-20">Start recording?</p>
<p id="p-21">Start the episode?</p>
<p id="p-22">I guess we should just get started, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-23">Let's just dive right into it.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-24">Let's just dive right into it then.</p>
<p id="p-25">Let's get started then.</p>
<p id="p-26">Guys, you may have noticed Lindsey and I using the word then a lot just at the beginning of this episode.</p>
<p id="p-27">Today we're going to answer a great question from our listener Julia about this word.</p>
<p id="p-28">It's funny.</p>
<p id="p-29">I love these episodes where they're about a teeny tiny word and there's so much to it and there's a lot we can talk about.</p>
<p id="p-30">So this is such a good question.</p>
<p id="p-31">I'm excited.</p>
<p id="p-32">Yeah, it's a teeny tiny word, but it's everywhere in English.</p>
<p id="p-33">All the time, constantly.</p>
<p id="p-34">It's one of those.</p>
<p id="p-35">So this is the kind of episode that's going to get our listeners thinking after they listen today.</p>
<p id="p-36">Let's see all the different places I can find this word and how can I start to use it to link together ideas to feel more natural in English, right?</p>
<p id="p-37">What should our listeners do before we read our question of the day from Julia?</p>

<p id="p-39">Sometimes I have it where if there's a podcast I listen to</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-40">I have it where if there's a podcast I listen to and I don't follow it, then I realize, oh wait, I missed all these episodes, right?</p>
<p id="p-41">And so this way it's just so much easier if you like a podcast to follow it and then I just get these little alerts and it's great.</p>
<p id="p-42">Yeah, good stuff.</p>
<p id="p-43">So hit that follow button right now, guys.</p>
<p id="p-44">Okay, Michelle, so today's question comes from Julia.</p>
<p id="p-45">Shall I read the question?</p>
<p id="p-46">Sure.</p>
<p id="p-47">All right, so Julia says, hi, how are you doing?</p>
<p id="p-48">I'm Julia and I really enjoy the podcast.</p>
<p id="p-49">Well, thank you, Julia.</p>
<p id="p-50">That's great to know.</p>
<p id="p-51">I've noticed that then is sometimes used to express surprise, disbelief, or emphasis, such as, if you didn't take it, who did then?</p>
<p id="p-52">Or, well then, that's unexpected.</p>
<p id="p-53">Or, what do you want then?</p>
<p id="p-54">How does then function in these cases?</p>
<p id="p-55">Is it mainly for emphasis or does it have another role?</p>
<p id="p-56">I'd love to hear your thoughts.</p>
<p id="p-57">Thank you, Beth, Julia.</p>
<p id="p-58">Excellent.</p>
<p id="p-59">Yeah, great question.</p>
<p id="p-60">This is going to help a lot.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-61">Great question.</p>
<p id="p-62">This is going to help a lot of people, Julia, so thank you for bringing this to our attention.</p>
<p id="p-63">So this is an important focus of the word then.</p>
<p id="p-64">So let's start out by going through Julia's examples.</p>
<p id="p-65">So if you didn't take it, who did then?</p>
<p id="p-66">What is the then doing?</p>
<p id="p-67">Could we have just said who did?</p>
<p id="p-68">In this case, it means in that case.</p>
<p id="p-69">You could say if you didn't take it, who did?</p>
<p id="p-70">And sometimes people do say that, but this kind of rounds it out, I would say, a bit more.</p>
<p id="p-71">It makes it more emphatic, wouldn't you say, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-72">Yeah, I would say who did in that case, right?</p>
<p id="p-73">It's just, yeah, I like that.</p>
<p id="p-74">I think it rounds it out.</p>
<p id="p-75">It makes it a little bit more complete.</p>
<p id="p-76">You could have left it the other way too, but we say things in different ways, right?</p>
<p id="p-77">Yeah, and I think it also makes it a little bit more dramatic.</p>
<p id="p-78">So we said emphatic, but also maybe dramatic.</p>
<p id="p-79">Emphatic, dramatic, all the rhyming words.</p>
<p id="p-80">Yeah,</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-81">Yeah, there are times in life when we want to be dramatic, right?</p>
<p id="p-82">If you didn't take it, who did then?</p>
<p id="p-83">Who did then?</p>
<p id="p-84">Bring the drama.</p>
<p id="p-85">Don't bring it all the time, but bring it once in a while.</p>
<p id="p-86">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-87">But once in a while.</p>
<p id="p-88">Right, So then the other example was, well then, that's unexpected.</p>
<p id="p-89">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-90">And again, this comes back to, I'm seeing a pattern developing here, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-91">Well, in that case, right?</p>
<p id="p-92">So it comes back to, in these examples, in that case, related to what you just said.</p>
<p id="p-93">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-94">Or what about this?</p>
<p id="p-95">What do you want then?</p>
<p id="p-96">So this one to me is, it's like, yeah, in that case, in light of this, whatever is happening, what do you want then?</p>
<p id="p-97">Yeah, Yeah, same idea.</p>
<p id="p-98">Yeah, same idea.</p>
<p id="p-99">And of course, this is always going to be spoken in response to what someone said to us, right?</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-100">There's a breakup happening, right?</p>
<p id="p-101">And I don't know, some kind of drama with the end of a relationship.</p>
<p id="p-102">What do you want then?</p>
<p id="p-103">This person says, oh, you don't make me happy.</p>
<p id="p-104">What do you want then?</p>
<p id="p-105">Right?</p>
<p id="p-106">So just emphasize that we wouldn't have the then unless someone were saying something to us.</p>
<p id="p-107">Right, right.</p>
<p id="p-108">It's rounding out.</p>
<p id="p-109">It's not just in isolation.</p>
<p id="p-110">It's a full response.</p>
<p id="p-111">It kind of connects to something else.</p>
<p id="p-112">Yeah, good point.</p>
<p id="p-113">And yeah, the question also was, does it show surprise and disbelief?</p>
<p id="p-114">Good question.</p>
<p id="p-115">What do you think, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-116">Yeah, so maybe, but not always.</p>
<p id="p-117">But it does emphasize what you're saying.</p>
<p id="p-118">So yeah, Julie mentioned that she's noticed that it shows surprise, disbelief, or emphasis.</p>
<p id="p-119">So yeah, let's kind of talk about that.</p>
<p id="p-120">So not always.</p>
<p id="p-121">I mean, this is not about time, right?</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-122">about time.</p>
<p id="p-123">Right, Yes, There are a lot of... We're talking about it in a different context.</p>
<p id="p-124">Yeah, There are a lot of different ways to use then, which I think we're going to talk about maybe another day.</p>
<p id="p-125">And we have before on the show.</p>
<p id="p-126">Then is such a common word in the English language.</p>
<p id="p-127">We don't have time in one episode to cover all the uses of it.</p>
<p id="p-128">Right, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-129">Yeah, it's very, very common.</p>
<p id="p-130">So, but let's give some more examples.</p>
<p id="p-131">So I'll see you tomorrow then.</p>
<p id="p-132">So sometimes it's just used in that relaxed way.</p>
<p id="p-133">Yeah, Yeah, this is really, really a marker of kind of native speaking here, how we can level up our English.</p>
<p id="p-134">Now, when we say it this way, it's not adding the layer of drama, right?</p>
<p id="p-135">But it is rounding it out in a sense that it's responding to what someone has said, which is we're going to see each other again soon, if that makes sense.</p>
<p id="p-136">Right, Again, and I think that to me, the best when I think of what this word actually means, if you boil</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-137">of what this word actually means if you boil it down.</p>
<p id="p-138">It's in that case, in light of this.</p>
<p id="p-139">So that connects to something else.</p>
<p id="p-140">That's what it means in my mind.</p>
<p id="p-141">Yeah, And to throw a curveball in here, sometimes people say this, and I've heard myself do this, it's incredibly natural.</p>
<p id="p-142">We say it not in response to what someone said.</p>
<p id="p-143">For example, I might get on the phone if you and I were meeting.</p>
<p id="p-144">Okay, next week I'm going to a conference in California.</p>
<p id="p-145">I might say to someone, so where are you from then?</p>
<p id="p-146">Sometimes it's just, you just put it there.</p>
<p id="p-147">You just put it there, and it's not like there's anything that really came before that.</p>
<p id="p-148">We've introduced ourselves, and that is a very natural.</p>
<p id="p-149">And what you're trying to do is make that question feel more natural and more smooth in a sense.</p>
<p id="p-150">Right, It's less abrupt sounding.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-151">up sounding, it kind of, I don't know, it's like you're coming down smoothly from, you're on the off ramp, right?</p>
<p id="p-152">Yes, Really interesting.</p>
<p id="p-153">But let's continue with these more direct examples and maybe we'll come back to that example, just to throw a curveball in case our listeners have heard native speakers say that then at the end and don't know what it's connected to.</p>
<p id="p-154">Yeah, And then Julia also had talked about well then.</p>
<p id="p-155">So yeah, we have well then, don't you look nice?</p>
<p id="p-156">And yeah, this is, I think this well then is almost more of a chunk.</p>
<p id="p-157">I mean, it's more about surprise.</p>
<p id="p-158">Well then, let's blah, blah, blah, right?</p>
<p id="p-159">Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p id="p-160">I agree.</p>
<p id="p-161">You think it's about surprise?</p>
<p id="p-162">Yeah, Hmm.</p>
<p id="p-163">Well then.</p>
<p id="p-164">Not always in this example, but it could always be, well then, I think we should change what we're doing, right?</p>
<p id="p-165">Yes, I like that.</p>
<p id="p-166">And then we have a quote here, if he doesn't show up, what will we do then?</p>
<p id="p-167">Well, this is more about time.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-168">then, well, this is more about time, right?</p>
<p id="p-169">What will we do at that time?</p>
<p id="p-170">To me, it's funny because I could see it in that way, but I wasn't thinking about it in time.</p>
<p id="p-171">I was still thinking about what will we do in that event, in that scenario.</p>
<p id="p-172">Not necessarily what will we do exactly, but more... That's really interesting.</p>
<p id="p-173">Right?</p>
<p id="p-174">It still serves kind of the same function.</p>
<p id="p-175">It just matters what intonation you use, right?</p>
<p id="p-176">If he doesn't show up, what will we do then?</p>
<p id="p-177">That's about time.</p>
<p id="p-178">If he doesn't show up, what will we do then?</p>
<p id="p-179">That's about the response in that case, right?</p>
<p id="p-180">Interesting, right?</p>
<p id="p-181">Woo! My brain is going in so many different directions.</p>
<p id="p-182">Yes, What about another example, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-183">All right.</p>
<p id="p-184">This one is similar.</p>
<p id="p-185">This one is very similar to what I already gave.</p>
<p id="p-186">So the restaurant says they may not have any tables.</p>
<p id="p-187">So where will we eat then?</p>
<p id="p-188">Yeah, I think that one is clearly, that one's a response in that case.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-189">That one's a response in that case.</p>
<p id="p-190">If that happens, where will we eat?</p>
<p id="p-191">Right?</p>
<p id="p-192">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-193">This is such a good question from Julia.</p>
<p id="p-194">We're going to take a quick break and come back and keep answering this question.</p>
<p id="p-195">Yes, Okay, Michelle, we are back.</p>
<p id="p-196">Now, when would we see ourselves throwing in then?</p>
<p id="p-197">Yeah, Right, So as we mentioned, here are some of the things we've kind of already talked about.</p>
<p id="p-198">So changing plans, reviewing plans, kind of planning for another, maybe if you need to plan something, a backup plan, what will we do then?</p>
<p id="p-199">If that doesn't work, what will we do then?</p>
<p id="p-200">Or ending conversations.</p>
<p id="p-201">So like, see you tomorrow then.</p>
<p id="p-202">Right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-203">In that case, in the case that we will come together tomorrow, I'll see you tomorrow then, right?</p>
<p id="p-204">When you're stating surprise, well then, I never knew XYZ, right?</p>
<p id="p-205">Or saying in that case, or in that</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-206">saying in that case or in that scenario, if that happens.</p>
<p id="p-207">And to me, that's the, for me, I think that's the biggest one that I'd love our listeners to walk away with, is thinking of it in that case.</p>
<p id="p-208">Because we're talking about a lot here, and it might be a little bit intimidating here to hear all of this because there's a lot of different situations.</p>
<p id="p-209">So in our opinion, try thinking of it in that case, in that event, in that scenario, and see how you can put it on there.</p>
<p id="p-210">If you're going to pick up one thing from the episode and walk away without overwhelming yourself, start with that.</p>
<p id="p-211">Yeah, I'm glad you said that, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-212">That's so true.</p>
<p id="p-213">That's going to cover probably 80% of the scenarios with the use of then in this way, not to talk about time or other things.</p>
<p id="p-214">Right?</p>
<p id="p-215">So in that case is what we're trying to say here.</p>
<p id="p-216">Let's see this in a role play, Michelle, shall we?</p>
<p id="p-217">Let's do it.</p>
<p id="p-218">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-219">All right, so we are friends planning for</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-220">We are friends planning for our friend's surprise party.</p>
<p id="p-221">Okay, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-222">All right.</p>
<p id="p-223">Okay, so we will tell her what?</p>
<p id="p-224">That she has a meeting with her boss.</p>
<p id="p-225">Okay, but isn't her boss away?</p>
<p id="p-226">How would that help us then?</p>
<p id="p-227">Oh, good point.</p>
<p id="p-228">We can just tell her I need help moving then.</p>
<p id="p-229">Oh, good idea.</p>
<p id="p-230">Well, then I'm glad you like it.</p>
<p id="p-231">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-232">All right.</p>
<p id="p-233">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-234">So again, in that case, right, using this as an example to mean in that case.</p>
<p id="p-235">So first you said, well, I said that we could tell her that she has a meeting with her boss.</p>
<p id="p-236">And you said, okay, but isn't her boss away?</p>
<p id="p-237">How would that help us then?</p>
<p id="p-238">And then here then means in that case in response to what?</p>
<p id="p-239">In response to you saying that we could say she has a meeting with the boss.</p>
<p id="p-240">Yeah, Because her boss is away.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-241">Yeah, because her boss is away, right?</p>
<p id="p-242">So you're kind of responding to yourself.</p>
<p id="p-243">You've said, oh, her boss is away.</p>
<p id="p-244">So how would that help us in that case, the case that her boss is away?</p>
<p id="p-245">Right, And again, I could have just said, how will that help us?</p>
<p id="p-246">But again, I think of this as an off-ramp.</p>
<p id="p-247">I just think of it as a way to smooth it out.</p>
<p id="p-248">I'm just adding it on.</p>
<p id="p-249">I don't need it, but it just does make it sound a little bit more gentle.</p>
<p id="p-250">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-251">Is it like we're downshifting from fifth gear into fourth gear and getting off the freeway?</p>
<p id="p-252">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-253">Slow down, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-254">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-255">Yeah, so it's an off-ramp.</p>
<p id="p-256">It's a response.</p>
<p id="p-257">It's rounding it out.</p>
<p id="p-258">It's really responding because we've talked about on this show that a key marker of connection is actually responding to what the person has said.</p>
<p id="p-259">In this case, you responded to yourself, right?</p>
<p id="p-260">Right, I'm talking to myself.</p>
<p id="p-261">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-262">Then you said, oh, good point.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-263">You said, oh, good point.</p>
<p id="p-264">We can just tell her I need help moving then.</p>
<p id="p-265">So you're making another suggestion.</p>
<p id="p-266">You're saying in light of what you said.</p>
<p id="p-267">In light of is another way to say it.</p>
<p id="p-268">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-269">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-270">Right, And then you said, oh, good idea.</p>
<p id="p-271">And now I brought out the different, the more dramatic way by saying what?</p>
<p id="p-272">Well, then I'm glad you like it.</p>
<p id="p-273">And well, then I don't want to introduce another context necessarily, but just really quickly, sometimes you might hear, well, then I'm leaving, right?</p>
<p id="p-274">Yeah, Yes, It's a very different use here of then, right?</p>
<p id="p-275">But we talked about it earlier in the episodes.</p>
<p id="p-276">We just wanted to show you an example here.</p>
<p id="p-277">Good.</p>
<p id="p-278">Michelle, is there another episode our listeners should check out?</p>
<p id="p-279">Yeah, guys, head on over to episode 2380.</p>
<p id="p-280">That was keep English straight with these idioms.</p>
<p id="p-281">Very nice.</p>
<p id="p-282">And guys, don't forget to hit that follow button on the show.</p>
<p id="p-283">And I think for our takeaway today, Michelle, it comes back to connection.</p>
<p id="p-284">Like I said, as much as you can</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-285">As much as you can let the person know you've heard them and you are responding to them, because these days people don't listen, right?</p>
<p id="p-286">They don't always listen.</p>
<p id="p-287">And so people like to make sure to know that you're listening to them, right?</p>
<p id="p-288">Yeah, Yeah, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-289">Very important.</p>
<p id="p-290">And again, if you're walking, if you are overwhelmed at all by the information you learned today, try it in pieces.</p>
<p id="p-291">I would say first, just go with that in light of.</p>
<p id="p-292">I would go with that and try it first in that way, like using it in that case.</p>
<p id="p-293">And then you can move on to some of these other examples.</p>
<p id="p-294">But yeah, definitely give this a try.</p>
<p id="p-295">It's very useful.</p>
<p id="p-296">It sounds nice when you add then.</p>
<p id="p-297">It sounds nice.</p>
