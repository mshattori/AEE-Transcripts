<p>Hello, Michelle.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>Good, good, Lindsay.</p>
<p>Lindsay, if we're all set up, what should we do then?</p>
<p>Start recording?</p>
<p>Start the episode?</p>
<p>I guess we should just get started, Michelle.</p>
<p>Let's just dive right into it.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>Let's just dive right into it then.</p>
<p>Let's get started then.</p>
<p>Guys, you may have noticed Lindsey and I using the word then a lot just at the beginning of this episode.</p>
<p>Today we're going to answer a great question from our listener Julia about this word.</p>
<p>It's funny.</p>
<p>I love these episodes where they're about a teeny tiny word and there's so much to it and there's a lot we can talk about.</p>
<p>So this is such a good question.</p>
<p>I'm excited.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's a teeny tiny word, but it's everywhere in English.</p>
<p>All the time, constantly.</p>
<p>It's one of those.</p>
<p>So this is the kind of episode that's going to get our listeners thinking after they listen today.</p>
<p>Let's see all the different places I can find this word and how can I start to use it to link together ideas to feel more natural in English, right?</p>
<p>What should our listeners do before we read our question of the day from Julia?</p>
<p>Please hit the follow button because we don't want you to miss anything from us.</p>
<p>Sometimes I have it where if there's a podcast I listen to</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>I have it where if there's a podcast I listen to and I don't follow it, then I realize, oh wait, I missed all these episodes, right?</p>
<p>And so this way it's just so much easier if you like a podcast to follow it and then I just get these little alerts and it's great.</p>
<p>Yeah, good stuff.</p>
<p>So hit that follow button right now, guys.</p>
<p>Okay, Michelle, so today's question comes from Julia.</p>
<p>Shall I read the question?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>All right, so Julia says, hi, how are you doing?</p>
<p>I'm Julia and I really enjoy the podcast.</p>
<p>Well, thank you, Julia.</p>
<p>That's great to know.</p>
<p>I've noticed that then is sometimes used to express surprise, disbelief, or emphasis, such as, if you didn't take it, who did then?</p>
<p>Or, well then, that's unexpected.</p>
<p>Or, what do you want then?</p>
<p>How does then function in these cases?</p>
<p>Is it mainly for emphasis or does it have another role?</p>
<p>I'd love to hear your thoughts.</p>
<p>Thank you, Beth, Julia.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Yeah, great question.</p>
<p>This is going to help a lot.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>This is going to help a lot of people, Julia, so thank you for bringing this to our attention.</p>
<p>So this is an important focus of the word then.</p>
<p>So let's start out by going through Julia's examples.</p>
<p>So if you didn't take it, who did then?</p>
<p>What is the then doing?</p>
<p>Could we have just said who did?</p>
<p>In this case, it means in that case.</p>
<p>You could say if you didn't take it, who did?</p>
<p>And sometimes people do say that, but this kind of rounds it out, I would say, a bit more.</p>
<p>It makes it more emphatic, wouldn't you say, Michelle?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say who did in that case, right?</p>
<p>It's just, yeah, I like that.</p>
<p>I think it rounds it out.</p>
<p>It makes it a little bit more complete.</p>
<p>You could have left it the other way too, but we say things in different ways, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think it also makes it a little bit more dramatic.</p>
<p>So we said emphatic, but also maybe dramatic.</p>
<p>Emphatic, dramatic, all the rhyming words.</p>
<p>Yeah,</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>Yeah, there are times in life when we want to be dramatic, right?</p>
<p>If you didn't take it, who did then?</p>
<p>Who did then?</p>
<p>Bring the drama.</p>
<p>Don't bring it all the time, but bring it once in a while.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But once in a while.</p>
<p>Right, So then the other example was, well then, that's unexpected.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And again, this comes back to, I'm seeing a pattern developing here, Michelle.</p>
<p>Well, in that case, right?</p>
<p>So it comes back to, in these examples, in that case, related to what you just said.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Or what about this?</p>
<p>What do you want then?</p>
<p>So this one to me is, it's like, yeah, in that case, in light of this, whatever is happening, what do you want then?</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, same idea.</p>
<p>Yeah, same idea.</p>
<p>And of course, this is always going to be spoken in response to what someone said to us, right?</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>There's a breakup happening, right?</p>
<p>And I don't know, some kind of drama with the end of a relationship.</p>
<p>What do you want then?</p>
<p>This person says, oh, you don't make me happy.</p>
<p>What do you want then?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So just emphasize that we wouldn't have the then unless someone were saying something to us.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>It's rounding out.</p>
<p>It's not just in isolation.</p>
<p>It's a full response.</p>
<p>It kind of connects to something else.</p>
<p>Yeah, good point.</p>
<p>And yeah, the question also was, does it show surprise and disbelief?</p>
<p>Good question.</p>
<p>What do you think, Michelle?</p>
<p>Yeah, so maybe, but not always.</p>
<p>But it does emphasize what you're saying.</p>
<p>So yeah, Julie mentioned that she's noticed that it shows surprise, disbelief, or emphasis.</p>
<p>So yeah, let's kind of talk about that.</p>
<p>So not always.</p>
<p>I mean, this is not about time, right?</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>about time.</p>
<p>Right, Yes, There are a lot of... We're talking about it in a different context.</p>
<p>Yeah, There are a lot of different ways to use then, which I think we're going to talk about maybe another day.</p>
<p>And we have before on the show.</p>
<p>Then is such a common word in the English language.</p>
<p>We don't have time in one episode to cover all the uses of it.</p>
<p>Right, Michelle?</p>
<p>Yeah, it's very, very common.</p>
<p>So, but let's give some more examples.</p>
<p>So I'll see you tomorrow then.</p>
<p>So sometimes it's just used in that relaxed way.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, this is really, really a marker of kind of native speaking here, how we can level up our English.</p>
<p>Now, when we say it this way, it's not adding the layer of drama, right?</p>
<p>But it is rounding it out in a sense that it's responding to what someone has said, which is we're going to see each other again soon, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>Right, Again, and I think that to me, the best when I think of what this word actually means, if you boil</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>of what this word actually means if you boil it down.</p>
<p>It's in that case, in light of this.</p>
<p>So that connects to something else.</p>
<p>That's what it means in my mind.</p>
<p>Yeah, And to throw a curveball in here, sometimes people say this, and I've heard myself do this, it's incredibly natural.</p>
<p>We say it not in response to what someone said.</p>
<p>For example, I might get on the phone if you and I were meeting.</p>
<p>Okay, next week I'm going to a conference in California.</p>
<p>I might say to someone, so where are you from then?</p>
<p>Sometimes it's just, you just put it there.</p>
<p>You just put it there, and it's not like there's anything that really came before that.</p>
<p>We've introduced ourselves, and that is a very natural.</p>
<p>And what you're trying to do is make that question feel more natural and more smooth in a sense.</p>
<p>Right, It's less abrupt sounding.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>up sounding, it kind of, I don't know, it's like you're coming down smoothly from, you're on the off ramp, right?</p>
<p>Yes, Really interesting.</p>
<p>But let's continue with these more direct examples and maybe we'll come back to that example, just to throw a curveball in case our listeners have heard native speakers say that then at the end and don't know what it's connected to.</p>
<p>Yeah, And then Julia also had talked about well then.</p>
<p>So yeah, we have well then, don't you look nice?</p>
<p>And yeah, this is, I think this well then is almost more of a chunk.</p>
<p>I mean, it's more about surprise.</p>
<p>Well then, let's blah, blah, blah, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>You think it's about surprise?</p>
<p>Yeah, Hmm.</p>
<p>Well then.</p>
<p>Not always in this example, but it could always be, well then, I think we should change what we're doing, right?</p>
<p>Yes, I like that.</p>
<p>And then we have a quote here, if he doesn't show up, what will we do then?</p>
<p>Well, this is more about time.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>then, well, this is more about time, right?</p>
<p>What will we do at that time?</p>
<p>To me, it's funny because I could see it in that way, but I wasn't thinking about it in time.</p>
<p>I was still thinking about what will we do in that event, in that scenario.</p>
<p>Not necessarily what will we do exactly, but more... That's really interesting.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>It still serves kind of the same function.</p>
<p>It just matters what intonation you use, right?</p>
<p>If he doesn't show up, what will we do then?</p>
<p>That's about time.</p>
<p>If he doesn't show up, what will we do then?</p>
<p>That's about the response in that case, right?</p>
<p>Interesting, right?</p>
<p>Woo! My brain is going in so many different directions.</p>
<p>Yes, What about another example, Michelle?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>This one is similar.</p>
<p>This one is very similar to what I already gave.</p>
<p>So the restaurant says they may not have any tables.</p>
<p>So where will we eat then?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that one is clearly, that one's a response in that case.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>That one's a response in that case.</p>
<p>If that happens, where will we eat?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>This is such a good question from Julia.</p>
<p>We're going to take a quick break and come back and keep answering this question.</p>
<p>Yes, Okay, Michelle, we are back.</p>
<p>Now, when would we see ourselves throwing in then?</p>
<p>Yeah, Right, So as we mentioned, here are some of the things we've kind of already talked about.</p>
<p>So changing plans, reviewing plans, kind of planning for another, maybe if you need to plan something, a backup plan, what will we do then?</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, what will we do then?</p>
<p>Or ending conversations.</p>
<p>So like, see you tomorrow then.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>In that case, in the case that we will come together tomorrow, I'll see you tomorrow then, right?</p>
<p>When you're stating surprise, well then, I never knew XYZ, right?</p>
<p>Or saying in that case, or in that</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>saying in that case or in that scenario, if that happens.</p>
<p>And to me, that's the, for me, I think that's the biggest one that I'd love our listeners to walk away with, is thinking of it in that case.</p>
<p>Because we're talking about a lot here, and it might be a little bit intimidating here to hear all of this because there's a lot of different situations.</p>
<p>So in our opinion, try thinking of it in that case, in that event, in that scenario, and see how you can put it on there.</p>
<p>If you're going to pick up one thing from the episode and walk away without overwhelming yourself, start with that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm glad you said that, Michelle.</p>
<p>That's so true.</p>
<p>That's going to cover probably 80% of the scenarios with the use of then in this way, not to talk about time or other things.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So in that case is what we're trying to say here.</p>
<p>Let's see this in a role play, Michelle, shall we?</p>
<p>Let's do it.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>All right, so we are friends planning for</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>We are friends planning for our friend's surprise party.</p>
<p>Okay, here we go.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Okay, so we will tell her what?</p>
<p>That she has a meeting with her boss.</p>
<p>Okay, but isn't her boss away?</p>
<p>How would that help us then?</p>
<p>Oh, good point.</p>
<p>We can just tell her I need help moving then.</p>
<p>Oh, good idea.</p>
<p>Well, then I'm glad you like it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>So again, in that case, right, using this as an example to mean in that case.</p>
<p>So first you said, well, I said that we could tell her that she has a meeting with her boss.</p>
<p>And you said, okay, but isn't her boss away?</p>
<p>How would that help us then?</p>
<p>And then here then means in that case in response to what?</p>
<p>In response to you saying that we could say she has a meeting with the boss.</p>
<p>Yeah, Because her boss is away.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>Yeah, because her boss is away, right?</p>
<p>So you're kind of responding to yourself.</p>
<p>You've said, oh, her boss is away.</p>
<p>So how would that help us in that case, the case that her boss is away?</p>
<p>Right, And again, I could have just said, how will that help us?</p>
<p>But again, I think of this as an off-ramp.</p>
<p>I just think of it as a way to smooth it out.</p>
<p>I'm just adding it on.</p>
<p>I don't need it, but it just does make it sound a little bit more gentle.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Is it like we're downshifting from fifth gear into fourth gear and getting off the freeway?</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Slow down, yeah.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it's an off-ramp.</p>
<p>It's a response.</p>
<p>It's rounding it out.</p>
<p>It's really responding because we've talked about on this show that a key marker of connection is actually responding to what the person has said.</p>
<p>In this case, you responded to yourself, right?</p>
<p>Right, I'm talking to myself.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Then you said, oh, good point.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>You said, oh, good point.</p>
<p>We can just tell her I need help moving then.</p>
<p>So you're making another suggestion.</p>
<p>You're saying in light of what you said.</p>
<p>In light of is another way to say it.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Right, And then you said, oh, good idea.</p>
<p>And now I brought out the different, the more dramatic way by saying what?</p>
<p>Well, then I'm glad you like it.</p>
<p>And well, then I don't want to introduce another context necessarily, but just really quickly, sometimes you might hear, well, then I'm leaving, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, Yes, It's a very different use here of then, right?</p>
<p>But we talked about it earlier in the episodes.</p>
<p>We just wanted to show you an example here.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Michelle, is there another episode our listeners should check out?</p>
<p>Yeah, guys, head on over to episode 2380.</p>
<p>That was keep English straight with these idioms.</p>
<p>Very nice.</p>
<p>And guys, don't forget to hit that follow button on the show.</p>
<p>And I think for our takeaway today, Michelle, it comes back to connection.</p>
<p>Like I said, as much as you can</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>As much as you can let the person know you've heard them and you are responding to them, because these days people don't listen, right?</p>
<p>They don't always listen.</p>
<p>And so people like to make sure to know that you're listening to them, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, Exactly.</p>
<p>Very important.</p>
<p>And again, if you're walking, if you are overwhelmed at all by the information you learned today, try it in pieces.</p>
<p>I would say first, just go with that in light of.</p>
<p>I would go with that and try it first in that way, like using it in that case.</p>
<p>And then you can move on to some of these other examples.</p>
<p>But yeah, definitely give this a try.</p>
<p>It's very useful.</p>
<p>It sounds nice when you add then.</p>
<p>It sounds nice.</p>
<p>We want to sound nice.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>It sounds nice.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Sounds good, Michelle.</p>
<p>I'll see you in the next episode.</p>
<p>You take care.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>You too.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
