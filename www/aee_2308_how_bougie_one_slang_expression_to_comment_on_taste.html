<p id="p-10">trendy slang term that we use when someone makes an expensive choice.</p>
<p id="p-11">Find out exactly how to use this today.</p>
<p id="p-12">Hello, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-13">How's it going today?</p>
<p id="p-14">Good, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-15">Lindsay, I have a question for you.</p>
<p id="p-16">Okay, I'm ready.</p>
<p id="p-17">Are you bougie?</p>
<p id="p-18">Bougie?</p>
<p id="p-19">Oh my gosh, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-20">I actually don't think I'm very bougie, but some people might think, some people might think so.</p>
<p id="p-21">It's all your perspective, right?</p>
<p id="p-22">It's true.</p>
<p id="p-23">Right, Some people might classify certain things as bougie and certain things as not bougie.</p>
<p id="p-24">Right, Yes, Yes, What about you, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-25">Are you bougie?</p>
<p id="p-26">I also don't think so.</p>
<p id="p-27">But again, same as you.</p>
<p id="p-28">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-29">I really don't think so.</p>
<p id="p-30">That's so funny.</p>
<p id="p-31">But you never know.</p>
<p id="p-32">So, but today we're going to answer a question from a listener about this word.</p>
<p id="p-33">This is such a good question.</p>
<p id="p-34">And recently, even this came up in my everyday life.</p>
<p id="p-35">I heard</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-36">my everyday life, I heard somebody using it, so I was excited when I saw this episode.</p>
<p id="p-37">It's really amazing when I hear something and then I realize, oh my gosh, a listener just asked a question about that.</p>
<p id="p-38">That tells me that this listener is super in tune with the English language and learning.</p>
<p id="p-39">And so I just want to say that's a great, great question.</p>
<p id="p-40">I know.</p>
<p id="p-41">I feel the same way, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-42">I'm going to go ahead and read the question.</p>
<p id="p-43">And this comes from YouTube.</p>
<p id="p-44">And the question is, thanks so much, Lindsay and Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-45">I love your amazing podcasts.</p>
<p id="p-46">Okay, Michelle, that's wonderful to hear.</p>
<p id="p-47">Could you please make a video about this slang word, bougie?</p>
<p id="p-48">Thank you in advance.</p>
<p id="p-49">Omid from Iran.</p>
<p id="p-50">Wow.</p>
<p id="p-51">Good question.</p>
<p id="p-52">Yeah, Very, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-53">This is going to be a fun one.</p>
<p id="p-54">Yeah, Like I said, I've been hearing this word a lot just the other day I heard it.</p>
<p id="p-55">So we're going to talk about what it means.</p>
<p id="p-56">So just to give you a little bit of a background, I found an article on USA Today dot com by</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-57">I don't have the date on it for some reason, but it basically talks about, it says, it's called what you're, oh, sorry, I have it, June, it's from a while back, June 30th, 2017.</p>
<p id="p-58">And it's called what you're really saying when you call something bougie.</p>
<p id="p-59">And it goes into a lot.</p>
<p id="p-60">But one of the things that says it's, and I bet our French listeners know, it's from the French word bourgeoisie, which the article says, I quote, means of middle class status.</p>
<p id="p-61">Yes, So that's interesting.</p>
<p id="p-62">And then a little bit more interesting is this is again, from the article, it says in Marxist philosophy, the bourgeoisie were the owners and producers and industrialization and factory life.</p>
<p id="p-63">They typically valued property, profit and maintaining their societal status.</p>
<p id="p-64">Yes, The proletariat was the working class, pro is slang for low status.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-65">class.</p>
<p id="p-66">Prole is slang for low status, but it's not used at all that much these days.</p>
<p id="p-67">Yeah, I don't hear that.</p>
<p id="p-68">Also, it would be rude to call someone prole.</p>
<p id="p-69">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-70">So the word actually evolved.</p>
<p id="p-71">The article talks about how then it was used for middle or upper class materialism.</p>
<p id="p-72">And then it has now over time, it evolved to generally mean upper or high class.</p>
<p id="p-73">It could be that a person is really upper class for their taste, or maybe they aren't really, but they want to be.</p>
<p id="p-74">Or they want to appear that way, right?</p>
<p id="p-75">Right, So this word has had a little bit of an evolution.</p>
<p id="p-76">So I just wanted to give that back research that I did.</p>
<p id="p-77">Yeah, Yes, Yeah, It's had an evolution and it's having a resurgence now in slang.</p>
<p id="p-78">So this is something that you might hear your friend say to you if you order a</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-79">that you might hear your friend say to you if you order a fancy coffee or something, right?</p>
<p id="p-80">And we'll get into examples here.</p>
<p id="p-81">But yeah, so what part of speech is this?</p>
<p id="p-82">Is this a noun, a verb, what is it?</p>
<p id="p-83">Right, so we use that as an adjective actually.</p>
<p id="p-84">So we say something is bougie or someone is bougie.</p>
<p id="p-85">So let's give some examples.</p>
<p id="p-86">There were many examples in the article, but I came up with some on my own that I thought of.</p>
<p id="p-87">So these are fun.</p>
<p id="p-88">So one thing I thought of was having a wine and cheese weekly club with your friends, that's kind of bougie.</p>
<p id="p-89">What do you think, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-90">I totally agree.</p>
<p id="p-91">Anything involving wine and cheese is probably kind of bougie or you could say it's bougie, right?</p>
<p id="p-92">It's all about someone proclaiming this is really bougie.</p>
<p id="p-93">Yeah, or a fancy restaurant, right?</p>
<p id="p-94">Or sometimes I love when you go into hotels and the water is infused with lime, lemon, fruit, pineapple, all sorts of things.</p>
<p id="p-95">Yeah, water and it's not just.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-96">Cucumber.</p>
<p id="p-97">Yeah, Water.</p>
<p id="p-98">And not just water.</p>
<p id="p-99">Water.</p>
<p id="p-100">Right, Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-101">At a hotel.</p>
<p id="p-102">Yeah, Yeah, And it's usually in a fancy large jar.</p>
<p id="p-103">Right, It looks beautiful.</p>
<p id="p-104">Presentation.</p>
<p id="p-105">Yes, That's bougie.</p>
<p id="p-106">Yes, Or or, you know, just in a typical one is just buying expensive things.</p>
<p id="p-107">Maybe certain clothes are bougie or purses are bougie.</p>
<p id="p-108">So, Lindsay, we were talking about if we can tell if we are bougie and it's a little bit tricky.</p>
<p id="p-109">But do you know anyone who's bougie?</p>
<p id="p-110">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-111">I did not.</p>
<p id="p-112">I wouldn't say any of my friends, really.</p>
<p id="p-113">I guess I know some people indirectly who maybe have, let's say, slightly more expensive elevated taste.</p>
<p id="p-114">Maybe.</p>
<p id="p-115">Right, They might choose instead of a mid-range hotel like like Hilton on the side of the highway, they might like when you're doing a road trip, they might go to a Marriott.</p>
<p id="p-116">What is the high end Marriott?</p>
<p id="p-117">Marriott.</p>
<p id="p-118">J.W. J.W. Marriott.</p>
<p id="p-119">Yes,</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-120">J.W. Marriott.</p>
<p id="p-121">J.W. Marriott, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-122">Yes, yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-123">And so that kind of thing.</p>
<p id="p-124">I would say I would qualify as bougie, somewhat bougie, or trending towards bougie.</p>
<p id="p-125">Yeah, what about you, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-126">Are you bougie?</p>
<p id="p-127">Bougie adjacent.</p>
<p id="p-128">Again, I don't think I'm bougie, but yeah, I'm trying to think, you know, probably guys, when you're listening to us talk about this, there's somebody, when you hear this word, someone pops into your head, a picture of someone.</p>
<p id="p-129">Yeah, What does, I definitely know some bougie people.</p>
<p id="p-130">So what does this person do?</p>
<p id="p-131">What does this person like?</p>
<p id="p-132">So, I mean, bougie can be a person, a place, a thing, an activity, a general feeling, someone's taste, lots of different things to use bougie for.</p>
<p id="p-133">So it's very, very useful.</p>
<p id="p-134">So let's talk about how we would use it.</p>
<p id="p-135">Lindsay, you wanna do an example for us?</p>
<p id="p-136">Yeah, we can say, oh gosh, this hotel is so bougie.</p>
<p id="p-137">Ooh, they even have cucumber-infused water up at the front.</p>
<p id="p-138">I'll be right.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-139">infused water up at the front.</p>
<p id="p-140">I'll be right back.</p>
<p id="p-141">That's fun.</p>
<p id="p-142">Sometimes, you know, when you, when you, it's fun to stay in a nice hotel sometimes, you know?</p>
<p id="p-143">Yes, it is.</p>
<p id="p-144">It is definitely nice.</p>
<p id="p-145">Um, or here's another one.</p>
<p id="p-146">I like her, but she's a bit too bougie for me.</p>
<p id="p-147">I generally hang out with people who are a little bit more down to earth.</p>
<p id="p-148">Would we say that that's an opposite of bougie down to earth?</p>
<p id="p-149">Would you say, I think that's a pretty good Anton in there.</p>
<p id="p-150">I mean, this is going to, it makes it sound like bougie is a bad thing.</p>
<p id="p-151">I mean, do you think that bougie has a negative connotation or a positive connotation or it really kind of depends?</p>
<p id="p-152">I think it depends on who you talk to, but I don't think I, I'm not, I'm not trying to judge people based on how they want to spend their money.</p>
<p id="p-153">You know, it's a free country.</p>
<p id="p-154">You could spend your money however you want.</p>
<p id="p-155">Maybe, maybe this person has as much money as someone else who dresses modestly, drives a modest car, but that other person wants to compound their funds on the stock market.</p>
<p id="p-156">That's totally legitimate too.</p>
<p id="p-157">They say that Warren Buffett.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-158">legitimate, too.</p>
<p id="p-159">They say that Warren Buffett drives like an old kicker car or just a kind of just not a great car.</p>
<p id="p-160">And his son, I heard his son begs him to get a new car every ten years or something like that.</p>
<p id="p-161">Oh, really?</p>
<p id="p-162">I mean, a lot of truly wealthy people don't show their wealth.</p>
<p id="p-163">That's the truth.</p>
<p id="p-164">So sometimes when I see bougie, I think this person might be trying to appear wealthy, but may actually not be that.</p>
<p id="p-165">That's that's a trend.</p>
<p id="p-166">If you look at really, really, I mean, you could see them in just like jeans and everyday clothes sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-167">Yeah, because I don't want to be known as being wealthy sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-168">Right, Yeah, That's very interesting.</p>
<p id="p-169">I've heard that, too, about, you know.</p>
<p id="p-170">Yeah, And also showing your wealth.</p>
<p id="p-171">Yeah, And also like purchasing things like a fancy car.</p>
<p id="p-172">We know that's a terrible investment.</p>
<p id="p-173">So they would know that if people are wealthy.</p>
<p id="p-174">So sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-175">Yeah, I think but I think it's OK if you want to wear fancy clothes and buy fancy drinks.</p>
<p id="p-176">Yeah, As we say.</p>
<p id="p-177">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-178">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-179">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-180">So.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-181">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-182">So, yeah, it could be really either, but if you hear somebody, you really have to listen to the person's tone of voice who's using it.</p>
<p id="p-183">So example, for example, in the first one you gave about the hotel, you said, this hotel is so bougie.</p>
<p id="p-184">It sounds like you're happy about it, right?</p>
<p id="p-185">You like that.</p>
<p id="p-186">Yeah, yeah, because I could be a person who's not bougie, but I go to a place, I happen to book something that is bougie, and then I can really enjoy it.</p>
<p id="p-187">So I can comment on the situation, right?</p>
<p id="p-188">Yes, right.</p>
<p id="p-189">Or let's give another example.</p>
<p id="p-190">The scent in this place makes it seem so bougie.</p>
<p id="p-191">So that's kind of neutral sounding, we don't really know.</p>
<p id="p-192">So again, it depends on the context.</p>
<p id="p-193">It depends on how you say it.</p>
<p id="p-194">Yes, yes.</p>
<p id="p-195">You really have to listen up when you hear this word to know what connotation it has.</p>
<p id="p-196">Right, so you're saying maybe you walk into a yoga studio and there's a.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-197">yoga studio and the lobby is infused with lavender or something like that, right?</p>
<p id="p-198">That sort of thing, bougie.</p>
<p id="p-199">Bougie.</p>
<p id="p-200">All right, good stuff.</p>

<p id="p-215">Let's get some other ways we could say this.</p>
<p id="p-216">There are some other things, and it's interesting.</p>
<p id="p-217">I don't think of American society as very classist in that sense.</p>
<p id="p-218">In my mind, we don't pay a ton of attention to class.</p>
<p id="p-219">We pay attention to other things, but obviously we do because it's in our language, right?</p>
<p id="p-220">The first one is swanky.</p>
<p id="p-221">That bar is too swanky.</p>
<p id="p-222">There's a dress code and everything.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-223">everything.</p>
<p id="p-224">Yeah, Lindsay, have you ever heard of a bar having a dress code?</p>
<p id="p-225">And you're like, ah, especially shoes.</p>
<p id="p-226">Well, I found that more in Europe, I think.</p>
<p id="p-227">But probably fancier bars or clubs, especially in New York, you know, L.A. We try to walk in with white tennis shoes.</p>
<p id="p-228">Yeah, You might not get like basketball running shoes or something.</p>
<p id="p-229">You might not get in.</p>
<p id="p-230">Yeah, that's true.</p>
<p id="p-231">Right, For sure.</p>
<p id="p-232">Right, Right, Right, Right, So maybe.</p>
<p id="p-233">Yeah, Yeah, It's I mean, listen, it's fair if a business has a certain.</p>
<p id="p-234">Yeah, Idea of what they how they want to appear and the kind of, you know, it is fair.</p>
<p id="p-235">Sometimes it's annoying, but yeah, it's fair.</p>
<p id="p-236">It's fair.</p>
<p id="p-237">Have you ever been turned away from a club, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-238">Oh, I feel I go to I went to so few clubs that I don't think I could have been.</p>
<p id="p-239">But I definitely have been worried about my Birkenstocks.</p>
<p id="p-240">Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-241">If I can get if I can get into that.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-242">get if I can get into that.</p>
<p id="p-243">You know, I sometimes oh, not a club, but there was recently a restaurant that we wanted to try out and we didn't realize it looked really nice on the outside, but we brought our kids there.</p>
<p id="p-244">And as soon as we walked in, we thought, Oh, this is not Oh, not for them.</p>
<p id="p-245">This is not for them.</p>
<p id="p-246">Yeah, And we were wearing people were more dressed up than we were.</p>
<p id="p-247">It wasn't what we were imagining.</p>
<p id="p-248">So yeah, that's a little bad, but it was good food.</p>
<p id="p-249">Oh, well, there you go.</p>
<p id="p-250">You got in though.</p>
<p id="p-251">You got served and everything.</p>
<p id="p-252">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-253">Yeah, You were those people.</p>
<p id="p-254">Oh, I'm those people all the time.</p>
<p id="p-255">We went to a restaurant the other night and my daughter was just throwing rice everywhere.</p>
<p id="p-256">And we were thinking probably when we leave, everybody was gonna dig a clap.</p>
<p id="p-257">You know, it was just Yeah, Oh, that's so funny.</p>
<p id="p-258">So that's that's</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-259">Oh, that's so funny.</p>
<p id="p-260">So that's that's a swanky restaurant where, you know, yeah, you walk in and you realize, OK, this is not you know, we're not dressed for this or something.</p>
<p id="p-261">Oh, or or or or do you ever like is it?</p>
<p id="p-262">So I think we've talked about this before.</p>
<p id="p-263">If you walk into a clothing store and you check, you look at one price tag and you think I am in the wrong place, but now they've said hello to me and now I have to kind of do the lap around and pretend that I'm looking.</p>
<p id="p-264">But there's no chance I'm coming back here.</p>
<p id="p-265">Yeah, you shared that before that, you know, you look at the price tags just to make sure that people don't think you don't know that you feel like it's not for you or something.</p>
<p id="p-266">Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-267">I think our listeners can resonate.</p>
<p id="p-268">Right, Yeah, It reminds me a little bit of Pretty Woman, the movie when she went to the fancy store and then but she actually did have the money.</p>
<p id="p-269">Remember that scene in Beverly Hills?</p>
<p id="p-270">I've only seen Pretty Woman once.</p>
<p id="p-271">Are you kidding me?</p>
<p id="p-272">I know, I know, I know.</p>
<p id="p-273">That's actually a good example of looking at class and society.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-274">looking at class in society.</p>
<p id="p-275">If you want, in American society, if you're curious about how class works here, guys, that would be a, I mean, it's an old movie, but it's a classic, and it's all about class, right?</p>
<p id="p-276">Yeah, Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-277">So, all right, another word would be upscale.</p>
<p id="p-278">So you could say, there's this adorable boutique I love, it's really upscale.</p>
<p id="p-279">Yes, or snobby.</p>
<p id="p-280">Okay, so this adds a bit more of a value judgment on it, right?</p>
<p id="p-281">Because someone could be bougie, but perfectly nice.</p>
<p id="p-282">Right?</p>
<p id="p-283">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-284">If you're snobby, you're adding an attitude.</p>
<p id="p-285">So her group of friends is pretty snobby.</p>
<p id="p-286">And snobby, does it always come with money?</p>
<p id="p-287">No.</p>
<p id="p-288">Good question, right?</p>
<p id="p-289">No, it doesn't always come with money.</p>
<p id="p-290">Right, it doesn't have to.</p>
<p id="p-291">And yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-292">This is the most, this word out of all of them is the one with the most judgment.</p>
<p id="p-293">So you wouldn't use this as a total replacement.</p>
<p id="p-294">Oh, this hotel is so snobby.</p>
<p id="p-295">Yeah, it just wouldn't necessarily work in the...</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-296">It just wouldn't necessarily work in that way.</p>
<p id="p-297">This one is holding judgment.</p>
<p id="p-298">So we talk about being able to tell from the context.</p>
<p id="p-299">This one, there's no telling from the context.</p>
<p id="p-300">It says it right in the word.</p>
<p id="p-301">Yeah, And so what it means is rude or exclusive, right?</p>
<p id="p-302">If someone is snobby, they're acting exclusively.</p>
<p id="p-303">A group could be not talking to other people outside of the group because they think they're superior, right?</p>
<p id="p-304">That is snobby.</p>
<p id="p-305">Usually, it's associated with money but not all the time.</p>
<p id="p-306">I remember when I was a kid, I thought certain other kids were snobby but I had nothing to do with how much money they had.</p>
<p id="p-307">It was just kind of their attitude.</p>
<p id="p-308">They're a little bit, you know, that kind of thing.</p>
<p id="p-309">Yes, Yes, And what's the last one?</p>
<p id="p-310">Expensive taste, right?</p>
<p id="p-311">So this is good.</p>
<p id="p-312">I have expensive taste, especially when it comes to fashion.</p>
<p id="p-313">And when you have a conversation about your money values, it's totally fine to say, I have expensive taste when it comes to X but everything else, I have more down to earth taste, right?</p>
<p id="p-314">Because some people value certain things, maybe like...</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p id="p-315">things, maybe like where the neighborhood they live in or the kind of car they buy or I don't know, quality clothing, but everything else they don't care about.</p>
<p id="p-316">So it's okay to differentiate and you're not all bougie or all not bougie.</p>
<p id="p-317">Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p id="p-318">Yes, And it is very interesting because I know people who maybe they have bougie taste when it comes to things for their house, but they walk around in sweats all the time.</p>
<p id="p-319">I know people who don't want to spend money on expensive clothes, but they go buy expensive theater tickets.</p>
<p id="p-320">So again, it's, it's yeah, everybody's taste is just different.</p>
<p id="p-321">Yeah, So Michelle, we do have a poll result to announce from a previous episode.</p>
<p id="p-322">Let's take a quick moment and announce those results.</p>
<p id="p-323">What episode was this poll from?</p>
<p id="p-324">So this was episode 2282.</p>
<p id="p-325">That was, we keep missing each other.</p>
<p id="p-326">And the question was, do you still have time?</p>
<p id="p-327">Do you still have catch-up conversations with people on the phone?</p>
<p id="p-328">So yes, all the time was 27.</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p id="p-329">all the time was 27%. This is interesting.</p>
<p id="p-330">No, I'm a texter was also 27%. Wow, weird.</p>
<p id="p-331">I was split down the middle.</p>
<p id="p-332">Weird.</p>
<p id="p-333">And then sometimes was 45%. So, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-334">Okay, interesting.</p>
<p id="p-335">Yeah, because we were talking in that episode about, yeah, are we still texting?</p>
<p id="p-336">Are we calling people?</p>
<p id="p-337">Really important conversation, right?</p>
<p id="p-338">Yeah, Definitely.</p>
<p id="p-339">Yeah, So, all right.</p>
<p id="p-340">Let's go ahead and put this together in a role play.</p>
<p id="p-341">All right.</p>
<p id="p-342">Here we just walked into a store.</p>
<p id="p-343">So, let's see who's bougie and who's not.</p>
<p id="p-344">Okay, okay, okay.</p>
<p id="p-345">All right.</p>
<p id="p-346">This place is gorgeous.</p>
<p id="p-347">Oh my goodness.</p>
<p id="p-348">They are serving champagne.</p>
<p id="p-349">How bougie?</p>
<p id="p-350">I knew it would be upscale, but I'm really, really impressed.</p>
<p id="p-351">It's so swanky.</p>
<p id="p-352">I just hope the salespeople aren't snobby.</p>
<p id="p-353">Same here.</p>
<p id="p-354">It's a good thing we have expensive taste.</p>
<p id="p-355">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-356">I know when you go to shop for a wedding dress, sometimes they'll offer you champagne, right?</p>
<p id="p-357">I don't know.</p>
<h2>Part-21</h2>
<p id="p-358">Right when you go or maybe I don't I've never had this experience But when you go to a really fancy jewelry store, maybe they offer you really high-end stuff.</p>
<p id="p-359">They probably don't serve champagne, right?</p>
<p id="p-360">Probably probably All right.</p>
<p id="p-361">So what would be the first thing?</p>
<p id="p-362">So first you said, oh my goodness They are serving champagne and then you said I said how bougie, right?</p>
<p id="p-363">Yes, and then I said I knew it would be upscale, but I'm really really impressed.</p>
<p id="p-364">Yes, perfect And then I said, it's just so it's so swanky, right?</p>
<p id="p-365">It's so swanky Yes, and then I used the judgment word.</p>
<p id="p-366">I said, I just hope that salespeople aren't snobby So I'm you know passing judgment on okay.</p>
<p id="p-367">It's really nice.</p>
<p id="p-368">So maybe they're snobby.</p>
<p id="p-369">Yes, exactly And then I said same here.</p>
<p id="p-370">It's a good thing.</p>
<p id="p-371">We have expensive taste All right.</p>
<p id="p-372">So yeah, it's a it's a little awkward when you go shopping with a friend who doesn't have the same taste Have you had that experience I don't go shopping a ton and I have a feeling maybe</p>
<h2>Part-22</h2>
<p id="p-373">shopping a ton.</p>
<p id="p-374">And I have a feeling maybe, not sure if you do, Michelle, shop a lot.</p>
<p id="p-375">No, not a lot.</p>
<p id="p-376">I mean, I mostly go around Target.</p>
<p id="p-377">Yeah, right.</p>
<p id="p-378">Yeah, So, but I mean, I definitely have friends or family members who have, you know, who spend different amount of money on clothes than I do.</p>
<p id="p-379">And that's totally fine.</p>
<p id="p-380">Yeah, Yeah, So you don't mind shopping with them and just kind of watching them buy stuff?</p>
<p id="p-381">I feel like I don't go shopping with them that much, actually.</p>
<p id="p-382">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-383">It doesn't happen.</p>
<p id="p-384">Yeah, Shopping for me is not a big hobby.</p>
<p id="p-385">So it's not a way I spend my time all that much.</p>
<p id="p-386">Yeah, Yeah, I go if I need something.</p>
<p id="p-387">If you need something.</p>
<p id="p-388">And boy, do I need something.</p>
<p id="p-389">Yeah, I need clothes.</p>
<p id="p-390">So anyway.</p>
<p id="p-391">All right, Michelle, what is another episode our listeners could check out?</p>
<p id="p-392">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-393">Episode 2193 was, is it too pricey how to talk about your money values in English?</p>
<p id="p-394">So that really gets into it.</p>
<p id="p-395">That was a good one.</p>
<p id="p-396">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-397">What's our takeaway for today?</p>
<p id="p-398">Where should we leave our listeners?</p>
<p id="p-399">I feel like we've got a lot of stuff that's come out today.</p>
<h2>Part-23</h2>
<p id="p-400">we've got a lot of stuff that's come out today around class and values around money.</p>
<p id="p-401">I mean, what do you think, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-402">Yeah, I mean, well, first of all, this is just such a great word.</p>
<p id="p-403">And it's just interesting how, yeah, people spend money on different things.</p>
<p id="p-404">And it doesn't necessarily mean they're bougie or whatever, but everybody has different values and how they want to spend their hard-earned money.</p>
<p id="p-405">And yeah, we have to respect that.</p>
<p id="p-406">And also just consider when we use these words, the context and how they sound.</p>
<p id="p-407">Yeah, I think the important thing to emphasize here is this slang word is used more for independent scenarios and situations and actions rather than describing a whole person as their ongoing character.</p>
<p id="p-408">Does that make sense?</p>
<p id="p-409">So again, like I said, at the top of the show, you ordered a double macchiato latte.</p>
<p id="p-410">How bougie.</p>
<p id="p-411">It's just the order.</p>
<p id="p-412">It's not, you are bougie, right?</p>
<p id="p-413">That's kind of, and that's always a good rule of thumb when it comes.</p>
<h2>Part-24</h2>
<p id="p-414">Rule of thumb when it comes to slang that could be interpreted as offensive to some people at some times It's just the action rather than the person, right?</p>
<p id="p-415">That makes it.</p>
<p id="p-416">Yeah, Yeah, I think yeah I think that's a great way to look at it because otherwise you might end up passing judgment on someone Right, or you know assuming certain things about them that aren't true So if we try and keep things away from the person and say okay in this situation Yeah, but we don't know all the information.</p>
<p id="p-417">Sure.</p>
<p id="p-418">Somebody might be bougie all the way around It's better to give people a chance I think yeah I mean there are people that just really love coffee and they'll buy the most expensive coffee and the grinders and everything But then they'll save money on other things So make it about the situation or the action not so much the person and you'll be good to go with this slang All right.</p>
<p id="p-419">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-420">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-421">All right, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-422">Thank you so much.</p>
<p id="p-423">And thank you to omit for this question Yes, take care Michelle.</p>
