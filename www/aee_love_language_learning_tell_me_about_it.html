<p id="p-9">What does it mean when someone says, tell me?</p>
<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p id="p-10">when someone says, tell me about it.</p>
<p id="p-11">It could mean two very different things depending on the intonation.</p>
<p id="p-12">Listen in for two amazing ways to connect in English.</p>
<p id="p-13">Hey Aubrey, how's it going today?</p>
<p id="p-14">I am great, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-15">How are you?</p>
<p id="p-16">Oh my gosh, busy, crazy week over here on my end.</p>
<p id="p-17">Oh, tell me about it.</p>
<p id="p-18">I have got a to-do list a mile long.</p>
<p id="p-19">Oh, we both have a busy week.</p>
<p id="p-20">And we can really understand each other, right?</p>
<p id="p-21">In that sense.</p>
<p id="p-22">Yeah, Oh man, this is such a great way.</p>
<p id="p-23">This is what we're talking about today, this expression, tell me about it, which is such a great way to express solidarity, but in a really fun, natural way.</p>
<p id="p-24">And also to kind of vent a little bit yourself, right?</p>
<p id="p-25">Because if you're also, you need a way to vent that out.</p>
<p id="p-26">You're also stressed or busy and you need to say that too.</p>
<p id="p-27">So build the connection, express solidarity.</p>
<p id="p-28">But before we get into this amazing phrase, let's ask our listeners to go ahead and hit that follow button.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-29">go ahead and hit that follow button.</p>
<p id="p-30">Aubrey, why should they hit follow on All Ears English?</p>
<p id="p-31">Yes, we have five episodes every week, guys.</p>
<p id="p-32">So if you're not following the podcast, you might be missing some of these.</p>
<p id="p-33">I know that's how I am with my podcasts.</p>
<p id="p-34">I just kind of like, I'll catch a couple.</p>
<p id="p-35">But honestly, most of the podcasts I listen to, one episode a week.</p>
<p id="p-36">So if I had one that was five episodes a week, I would definitely hit follow so that I didn't miss any.</p>
<p id="p-37">Especially if you believe in our philosophy, which is connection, not perfection.</p>
<p id="p-38">Connection, human connection to us is the most important thing when it comes to learning a language.</p>
<p id="p-39">That is why we're learning English.</p>
<p id="p-40">Ultimately, it is the reason.</p>
<p id="p-41">And that's how we angle every episode over here, guys.</p>
<p id="p-42">So hit that follow button.</p>
<p id="p-43">All right.</p>
<p id="p-44">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-45">Speaking of connection, I can't wait for this episode.</p>
<p id="p-46">We got a great question on YouTube from Omid Zakari.</p>
<p id="p-47">Would you like to read this question for us, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-48">Yes, let's do it.</p>
<p id="p-49">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-50">So Omid says, Hi, Aubrey, Lindsay, and Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-51">First of all, thanks so much for your amazing podcast.</p>
<p id="p-52">I've been listening to your podcast for</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-53">I've been listening to your podcast for nine years.</p>
<p id="p-54">Oh my gosh, Aubrey, a nine-year listener.</p>
<p id="p-55">That is so great.</p>
<p id="p-56">It's so good.</p>
<p id="p-57">I have a question for you.</p>
<p id="p-58">I read in a textbook the phrase, tell me about it, that it means I agree.</p>
<p id="p-59">To be honest, I'm a bit confused.</p>
<p id="p-60">Would it be possible for you to make a video and explain this phrase for me?</p>
<p id="p-61">Thank you in advance.</p>
<p id="p-62">Omid from Iran.</p>
<p id="p-63">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-64">Such a good question.</p>
<p id="p-65">I love this when we get a question about one specific phrase, and there's a reason Omid might be a little confused because we do use this two very different ways, and they have very different pronunciations as well.</p>
<p id="p-66">So I'm excited to dive into this.</p>
<p id="p-67">And we don't want to mix them up because you could end up in a conversation you're not trying to be in.</p>
<p id="p-68">Right?</p>
<p id="p-69">Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-70">It could be really confusing.</p>
<p id="p-71">That's for sure.</p>
<p id="p-72">So how are we going to, which way are we going to talk about first, Aubrey, for our listeners?</p>
<p id="p-73">First we're going to talk about the way Omid referred to where it means I agree.</p>
<p id="p-74">And this is a great connection skill.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-75">great connection skill.</p>
<p id="p-76">Instead of saying just, I agree, right?</p>
<p id="p-77">This is more interesting, more enthusiastic.</p>
<p id="p-78">I often say, same.</p>
<p id="p-79">You've for sure heard this in role plays.</p>
<p id="p-80">I'm like, same.</p>
<p id="p-81">This is another fun way to do this.</p>
<p id="p-82">Yeah, Saying same is a little more trendy right now, I think.</p>
<p id="p-83">But I think, tell me about it, is a classic over the years, over the decades.</p>
<p id="p-84">I know people were saying this back in the 90s.</p>
<p id="p-85">I was saying it a lot, but people still say it today, right?</p>
<p id="p-86">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-87">And to just be really clear up the top, there are two different ways that we say this.</p>
<p id="p-88">And one is when we, something's negative or hard, right?</p>
<p id="p-89">Like at the top of the episode, you said I'm super busy.</p>
<p id="p-90">I'm like, tell me about it.</p>
<p id="p-91">So that's the first one here.</p>
<p id="p-92">And the second one is when we're agreeing about something positive, our intonation is different.</p>
<p id="p-93">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-94">So it's kind of generally still agreeing, right?</p>
<p id="p-95">Still agreeing with someone.</p>
<p id="p-96">Yeah, both agreeing.</p>
<p id="p-97">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-98">But it's interesting how, when it's...</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-99">that's interesting how when it's something negative, we emphasize tell a lot more.</p>
<p id="p-100">Tell me about it, right?</p>
<p id="p-101">You can hear in my intonation that I'm upset about something or something's hard or frustrating.</p>
<p id="p-102">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-103">So today's episode is all about identifying, right?</p>
<p id="p-104">This use of tell me about it, all about identifying.</p>
<p id="p-105">So let's do a role play, Aubrey, real quick.</p>
<p id="p-106">Yeah, So this is usually as a response.</p>
<p id="p-107">So you're going to hear some role plays.</p>
<p id="p-108">You and I are in a doctor's office in the waiting room in this role play.</p>
<p id="p-109">All right.</p>
<p id="p-110">I'll start us out.</p>
<p id="p-111">Yes, I've been here for hours.</p>
<p id="p-112">This is so frustrating.</p>
<p id="p-113">Tell me about it.</p>
<p id="p-114">I don't know what's going on, but I've been waiting forever too.</p>
<p id="p-115">Right, So, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-116">So this is, you can hear in your intonation, you're also upset.</p>
<p id="p-117">And this is such a great connection skill.</p>
<p id="p-118">If someone is upset to the point, they're expressing it to you, a stranger, it's probably going to diffuse the situation and really help for you to also be like, I agree.</p>
<p id="p-119">I'm right there with you.</p>
<p id="p-120">Right, Because imagine what is the flip side?</p>
<p id="p-121">What if you don't say anything?</p>
<p id="p-122">You just go back to your magazine.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-123">don't say anything, you just go back to your magazine.</p>
<p id="p-124">You just listen to them, maybe turn your head, then go back to your magazine.</p>
<p id="p-125">You don't... Right, Or just be like, I don't mind waiting.</p>
<p id="p-126">Yeah, That would be so weird.</p>
<p id="p-127">So weird, especially for a stranger to hear that coming from someone.</p>
<p id="p-128">Exactly, right?</p>
<p id="p-129">I'm always... If someone's ever venting like this, I'm much more likely to be like, tell me about it.</p>
<p id="p-130">I know, right?</p>
<p id="p-131">So frustrating.</p>
<p id="p-132">Yeah, Okay.</p>
<p id="p-133">So here's another role play.</p>
<p id="p-134">Here we're waiting in the return line at Costco.</p>
<p id="p-135">Michelle and I just talked about Costco.</p>
<p id="p-136">Yeah, Oh, nice.</p>
<p id="p-137">I love Costco, but this one's positive.</p>
<p id="p-138">So notice the difference in the intonation of the phrase.</p>
<p id="p-139">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-140">All right.</p>
<p id="p-141">I love Costco's return policy.</p>
<p id="p-142">Tell me about it.</p>
<p id="p-143">It's so nice to not have to keep track of receipts.</p>
<p id="p-144">Yeah, So it's a little more positive.</p>
<p id="p-145">How's it different?</p>
<p id="p-146">It's less common, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-147">Don't you think?</p>
<p id="p-148">I mostly use tell me about it to express frustration, to agree about something negative.</p>
<p id="p-149">You can hear it.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-150">negative.</p>
<p id="p-151">You can hear it positive like this, and it's definitely different intonation.</p>
<p id="p-152">But I definitely use it more and I feel like I hear it more for negative things.</p>
<p id="p-153">What about you?</p>
<p id="p-154">Yeah, I would say so too.</p>
<p id="p-155">I would say, yeah, it's really, it's commiserating as they say, right?</p>
<p id="p-156">Tell me about it.</p>
<p id="p-157">Yeah, it's usually not about positive things in general.</p>
<p id="p-158">Okay, so I feel like that covers, you know, the commiserating idea.</p>
<p id="p-159">Now, where do we go from here, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-160">Yes, we have a second totally different meaning, which is more literal, where you're actually saying, tell me more about it when you say, tell me about it, right?</p>
<p id="p-161">So you do need to keep in mind that you could hear this phrase and it might mean I agree.</p>
<p id="p-162">And it might mean, you know, tell me more.</p>
<p id="p-163">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-164">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-165">So for example, what can we say?</p>
<p id="p-166">I heard you're doing a fundraiser.</p>
<p id="p-167">Tell me about it, right?</p>
<p id="p-168">Tell me about it.</p>
<p id="p-169">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-170">Just give me some information.</p>
<p id="p-171">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-172">Yeah, Or Mark told me you got a new job.</p>
<p id="p-173">Tell me about it.</p>
<p id="p-174">So this is really, it's very different.</p>
<p id="p-175">It's like saying you're</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-176">So this is really is very different.</p>
<p id="p-177">It's like saying you're open.</p>
<p id="p-178">You've heard something is going on and you're opening up a conversation.</p>
<p id="p-179">You're saying, I'm ready to listen.</p>
<p id="p-180">I'm interested.</p>
<p id="p-181">Right?</p>
<p id="p-182">Right, Right, So tricky that the exact same words have such a different meaning.</p>
<p id="p-183">You can really hear the difference in the intonation when someone's like, tell me about it.</p>
<p id="p-184">Yeah, It's just like, it's a little more flat kind of just like, tell me about it.</p>
<p id="p-185">Totally.</p>
<p id="p-186">So here's a role play.</p>
<p id="p-187">You ready?</p>
<p id="p-188">Yeah, I'll start us.</p>
<p id="p-189">Anything new with you?</p>
<p id="p-190">Well, I found a new gym that I really love.</p>
<p id="p-191">Oh, cool.</p>
<p id="p-192">Tell me about it.</p>
<p id="p-193">It's just around the corner from my house and they offer a ton of classes.</p>
<p id="p-194">That's good.</p>
<p id="p-195">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-196">Yes, Yeah, So yes, you can see there's a flatter intonation, right?</p>
<p id="p-197">You're not having to emphasize any words cause you're just, all you mean is, Oh, tell me more about that.</p>
<p id="p-198">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-199">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-200">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-201">Aubrey, should we have another role play now to bring everything together into one scenario?</p>
<p id="p-202">Yeah, Yeah, This role play has both of these uses, right?</p>
<p id="p-203">So listen for the different intonation.</p>
<p id="p-204">You can tell from context.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-205">the different intonation.</p>
<p id="p-206">You can tell from context what is meant, but especially from intonation.</p>
<p id="p-207">Yes, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-208">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-209">So weird.</p>
<p id="p-210">Yeah, New Year's resolutions.</p>
<p id="p-211">Okay, good topic.</p>
<p id="p-212">All right.</p>
<p id="p-213">Making any New Year's resolutions this year, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-214">Yeah, I'm trying out a new diet.</p>
<p id="p-215">Oh, cool.</p>
<p id="p-216">Tell me about it.</p>
<p id="p-217">Well, it's intermittent fasting combined with just a balanced diet.</p>
<p id="p-218">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-219">I should try that.</p>
<p id="p-220">I just have a hard time staying consistent with anything.</p>
<p id="p-221">Tell me about it.</p>
<p id="p-222">I'm hoping this one will stick.</p>
<p id="p-223">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-224">Very different intonation.</p>
<p id="p-225">Very, very different.</p>
<p id="p-226">I hope your listeners got that.</p>
<p id="p-227">Super different.</p>
<p id="p-228">Saying completely different things here, which is, I'm glad we're covering this topic.</p>
<p id="p-229">It's perfect for the show.</p>
<p id="p-230">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-231">Yes, Yeah, Okay.</p>
<p id="p-232">So the first one we used, I had just said, I'm trying a new diet.</p>
<p id="p-233">And so you said, oh, cool.</p>
<p id="p-234">Tell me about it.</p>
<p id="p-235">This just means I want to hear more, right?</p>
<p id="p-236">Give me some details.</p>
<p id="p-237">I'm open.</p>
<p id="p-238">I'm ready to listen.</p>
<p id="p-239">I'm interested.</p>
<p id="p-240">I'm curious.</p>
<p id="p-241">All really good signs for connection, right?</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-242">for connection.</p>
<p id="p-243">Right?</p>
<p id="p-244">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-245">What a great phrase, because there are a lot of ways you can say it, but this is another option.</p>
<p id="p-246">Yeah, perfect.</p>
<p id="p-247">And then I said, nice, I should try that.</p>
<p id="p-248">I just have a hard time staying consistent with anything.</p>
<p id="p-249">And then you identified with me and you said, tell me about it.</p>
<p id="p-250">And that is that kind of a bit of commiserating, a bit of shared pain, kind of.</p>
<p id="p-251">Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-252">Right, You can say, oh, I agree or same, but this gives you a fun, friendly.</p>
<p id="p-253">I like this one the most, really.</p>
<p id="p-254">It's not quite as common, but I feel like it is the most commiserating, like you said, like really showing that you understand and feel what they're going through.</p>
<p id="p-255">Yeah, no, it's a good one.</p>
<p id="p-256">It's a good one.</p>
<p id="p-257">This is good.</p>
<p id="p-258">So where's our, what's our takeaway for today for our listeners, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-259">Yeah, As you've heard from us before, sometimes intonation is really key for phrases like this.</p>
<p id="p-260">So tell me about it can mean two very different things depending on your intonation, but also what a great connection skill to share with someone.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-261">connection skill to share with someone that you have this in common, especially when it's something that you're venting about.</p>
<p id="p-262">I think both are good connection skills, showing you're curious, interested and open and ready to listen.</p>
<p id="p-263">Right, The first one we talked about.</p>
<p id="p-264">And then commiserating.</p>
<p id="p-265">Also, I'm not sure which is stronger, right?</p>
<p id="p-266">Sometimes it can be very strong to commiserate with people.</p>
<p id="p-267">We've done episodes about that to share, talk about how you share their pain in a certain way.</p>
<p id="p-268">It can be a strong connection skill, actually.</p>
<p id="p-269">Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-270">But you're right that the other one is so valuable, too.</p>
<p id="p-271">We often have students asking us, how can I keep the conversation going?</p>
<p id="p-272">This is one way, right?</p>
<p id="p-273">If someone tells you something new, some kind of detail, tell me about it.</p>
<p id="p-274">Tell me more.</p>
<p id="p-275">Be genuinely interested.</p>
<p id="p-276">Ask for more details that will keep the conversation going.</p>
<p id="p-277">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-278">That's kind of a best kept secret of the great conversationalists.</p>
<p id="p-279">Get the other people to continue talking.</p>
<p id="p-280">Get the other person to keep talking.</p>
<p id="p-281">Keep asking them questions.</p>
<p id="p-282">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-283">So good.</p>
<p id="p-284">All right.</p>
<p id="p-285">We are done for today, but I'll see you in the next episode.</p>
<p id="p-286">All right.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-287">the next episode.</p>
<p id="p-288">All right.</p>
