<p>What does it mean when someone says, tell me?</p>
<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p>when someone says, tell me about it.</p>
<p>It could mean two very different things depending on the intonation.</p>
<p>Listen in for two amazing ways to connect in English.</p>
<p>Hey Aubrey, how's it going today?</p>
<p>I am great, Lindsay.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, busy, crazy week over here on my end.</p>
<p>Oh, tell me about it.</p>
<p>I have got a to-do list a mile long.</p>
<p>Oh, we both have a busy week.</p>
<p>And we can really understand each other, right?</p>
<p>In that sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, Oh man, this is such a great way.</p>
<p>This is what we're talking about today, this expression, tell me about it, which is such a great way to express solidarity, but in a really fun, natural way.</p>
<p>And also to kind of vent a little bit yourself, right?</p>
<p>Because if you're also, you need a way to vent that out.</p>
<p>You're also stressed or busy and you need to say that too.</p>
<p>So build the connection, express solidarity.</p>
<p>But before we get into this amazing phrase, let's ask our listeners to go ahead and hit that follow button.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>go ahead and hit that follow button.</p>
<p>Aubrey, why should they hit follow on All Ears English?</p>
<p>Yes, we have five episodes every week, guys.</p>
<p>So if you're not following the podcast, you might be missing some of these.</p>
<p>I know that's how I am with my podcasts.</p>
<p>I just kind of like, I'll catch a couple.</p>
<p>But honestly, most of the podcasts I listen to, one episode a week.</p>
<p>So if I had one that was five episodes a week, I would definitely hit follow so that I didn't miss any.</p>
<p>Especially if you believe in our philosophy, which is connection, not perfection.</p>
<p>Connection, human connection to us is the most important thing when it comes to learning a language.</p>
<p>That is why we're learning English.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is the reason.</p>
<p>And that's how we angle every episode over here, guys.</p>
<p>So hit that follow button.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Speaking of connection, I can't wait for this episode.</p>
<p>We got a great question on YouTube from Omid Zakari.</p>
<p>Would you like to read this question for us, Lindsay?</p>
<p>Yes, let's do it.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>So Omid says, Hi, Aubrey, Lindsay, and Michelle.</p>
<p>First of all, thanks so much for your amazing podcast.</p>
<p>I've been listening to your podcast for</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>I've been listening to your podcast for nine years.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, Aubrey, a nine-year listener.</p>
<p>That is so great.</p>
<p>It's so good.</p>
<p>I have a question for you.</p>
<p>I read in a textbook the phrase, tell me about it, that it means I agree.</p>
<p>To be honest, I'm a bit confused.</p>
<p>Would it be possible for you to make a video and explain this phrase for me?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>Omid from Iran.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Such a good question.</p>
<p>I love this when we get a question about one specific phrase, and there's a reason Omid might be a little confused because we do use this two very different ways, and they have very different pronunciations as well.</p>
<p>So I'm excited to dive into this.</p>
<p>And we don't want to mix them up because you could end up in a conversation you're not trying to be in.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>It could be really confusing.</p>
<p>That's for sure.</p>
<p>So how are we going to, which way are we going to talk about first, Aubrey, for our listeners?</p>
<p>First we're going to talk about the way Omid referred to where it means I agree.</p>
<p>And this is a great connection skill.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>great connection skill.</p>
<p>Instead of saying just, I agree, right?</p>
<p>This is more interesting, more enthusiastic.</p>
<p>I often say, same.</p>
<p>You've for sure heard this in role plays.</p>
<p>I'm like, same.</p>
<p>This is another fun way to do this.</p>
<p>Yeah, Saying same is a little more trendy right now, I think.</p>
<p>But I think, tell me about it, is a classic over the years, over the decades.</p>
<p>I know people were saying this back in the 90s.</p>
<p>I was saying it a lot, but people still say it today, right?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And to just be really clear up the top, there are two different ways that we say this.</p>
<p>And one is when we, something's negative or hard, right?</p>
<p>Like at the top of the episode, you said I'm super busy.</p>
<p>I'm like, tell me about it.</p>
<p>So that's the first one here.</p>
<p>And the second one is when we're agreeing about something positive, our intonation is different.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>So it's kind of generally still agreeing, right?</p>
<p>Still agreeing with someone.</p>
<p>Yeah, both agreeing.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>But it's interesting how, when it's...</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>that's interesting how when it's something negative, we emphasize tell a lot more.</p>
<p>Tell me about it, right?</p>
<p>You can hear in my intonation that I'm upset about something or something's hard or frustrating.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So today's episode is all about identifying, right?</p>
<p>This use of tell me about it, all about identifying.</p>
<p>So let's do a role play, Aubrey, real quick.</p>
<p>Yeah, So this is usually as a response.</p>
<p>So you're going to hear some role plays.</p>
<p>You and I are in a doctor's office in the waiting room in this role play.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I'll start us out.</p>
<p>Yes, I've been here for hours.</p>
<p>This is so frustrating.</p>
<p>Tell me about it.</p>
<p>I don't know what's going on, but I've been waiting forever too.</p>
<p>Right, So, yeah.</p>
<p>So this is, you can hear in your intonation, you're also upset.</p>
<p>And this is such a great connection skill.</p>
<p>If someone is upset to the point, they're expressing it to you, a stranger, it's probably going to diffuse the situation and really help for you to also be like, I agree.</p>
<p>I'm right there with you.</p>
<p>Right, Because imagine what is the flip side?</p>
<p>What if you don't say anything?</p>
<p>You just go back to your magazine.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>don't say anything, you just go back to your magazine.</p>
<p>You just listen to them, maybe turn your head, then go back to your magazine.</p>
<p>You don't... Right, Or just be like, I don't mind waiting.</p>
<p>Yeah, That would be so weird.</p>
<p>So weird, especially for a stranger to hear that coming from someone.</p>
<p>Exactly, right?</p>
<p>I'm always... If someone's ever venting like this, I'm much more likely to be like, tell me about it.</p>
<p>I know, right?</p>
<p>So frustrating.</p>
<p>Yeah, Okay.</p>
<p>So here's another role play.</p>
<p>Here we're waiting in the return line at Costco.</p>
<p>Michelle and I just talked about Costco.</p>
<p>Yeah, Oh, nice.</p>
<p>I love Costco, but this one's positive.</p>
<p>So notice the difference in the intonation of the phrase.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I love Costco's return policy.</p>
<p>Tell me about it.</p>
<p>It's so nice to not have to keep track of receipts.</p>
<p>Yeah, So it's a little more positive.</p>
<p>How's it different?</p>
<p>It's less common, for sure.</p>
<p>Don't you think?</p>
<p>I mostly use tell me about it to express frustration, to agree about something negative.</p>
<p>You can hear it.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>negative.</p>
<p>You can hear it positive like this, and it's definitely different intonation.</p>
<p>But I definitely use it more and I feel like I hear it more for negative things.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say so too.</p>
<p>I would say, yeah, it's really, it's commiserating as they say, right?</p>
<p>Tell me about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's usually not about positive things in general.</p>
<p>Okay, so I feel like that covers, you know, the commiserating idea.</p>
<p>Now, where do we go from here, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yes, we have a second totally different meaning, which is more literal, where you're actually saying, tell me more about it when you say, tell me about it, right?</p>
<p>So you do need to keep in mind that you could hear this phrase and it might mean I agree.</p>
<p>And it might mean, you know, tell me more.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>So for example, what can we say?</p>
<p>I heard you're doing a fundraiser.</p>
<p>Tell me about it, right?</p>
<p>Tell me about it.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Just give me some information.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, Or Mark told me you got a new job.</p>
<p>Tell me about it.</p>
<p>So this is really, it's very different.</p>
<p>It's like saying you're</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>So this is really is very different.</p>
<p>It's like saying you're open.</p>
<p>You've heard something is going on and you're opening up a conversation.</p>
<p>You're saying, I'm ready to listen.</p>
<p>I'm interested.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Right, Right, So tricky that the exact same words have such a different meaning.</p>
<p>You can really hear the difference in the intonation when someone's like, tell me about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, It's just like, it's a little more flat kind of just like, tell me about it.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>So here's a role play.</p>
<p>You ready?</p>
<p>Yeah, I'll start us.</p>
<p>Anything new with you?</p>
<p>Well, I found a new gym that I really love.</p>
<p>Oh, cool.</p>
<p>Tell me about it.</p>
<p>It's just around the corner from my house and they offer a ton of classes.</p>
<p>That's good.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Yes, Yeah, So yes, you can see there's a flatter intonation, right?</p>
<p>You're not having to emphasize any words cause you're just, all you mean is, Oh, tell me more about that.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Aubrey, should we have another role play now to bring everything together into one scenario?</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, This role play has both of these uses, right?</p>
<p>So listen for the different intonation.</p>
<p>You can tell from context.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>the different intonation.</p>
<p>You can tell from context what is meant, but especially from intonation.</p>
<p>Yes, I love it.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>So weird.</p>
<p>Yeah, New Year's resolutions.</p>
<p>Okay, good topic.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Making any New Year's resolutions this year, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm trying out a new diet.</p>
<p>Oh, cool.</p>
<p>Tell me about it.</p>
<p>Well, it's intermittent fasting combined with just a balanced diet.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>I should try that.</p>
<p>I just have a hard time staying consistent with anything.</p>
<p>Tell me about it.</p>
<p>I'm hoping this one will stick.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Very different intonation.</p>
<p>Very, very different.</p>
<p>I hope your listeners got that.</p>
<p>Super different.</p>
<p>Saying completely different things here, which is, I'm glad we're covering this topic.</p>
<p>It's perfect for the show.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Yes, Yeah, Okay.</p>
<p>So the first one we used, I had just said, I'm trying a new diet.</p>
<p>And so you said, oh, cool.</p>
<p>Tell me about it.</p>
<p>This just means I want to hear more, right?</p>
<p>Give me some details.</p>
<p>I'm open.</p>
<p>I'm ready to listen.</p>
<p>I'm interested.</p>
<p>I'm curious.</p>
<p>All really good signs for connection, right?</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>for connection.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>What a great phrase, because there are a lot of ways you can say it, but this is another option.</p>
<p>Yeah, perfect.</p>
<p>And then I said, nice, I should try that.</p>
<p>I just have a hard time staying consistent with anything.</p>
<p>And then you identified with me and you said, tell me about it.</p>
<p>And that is that kind of a bit of commiserating, a bit of shared pain, kind of.</p>
<p>Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>Right, You can say, oh, I agree or same, but this gives you a fun, friendly.</p>
<p>I like this one the most, really.</p>
<p>It's not quite as common, but I feel like it is the most commiserating, like you said, like really showing that you understand and feel what they're going through.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, it's a good one.</p>
<p>It's a good one.</p>
<p>This is good.</p>
<p>So where's our, what's our takeaway for today for our listeners, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yeah, As you've heard from us before, sometimes intonation is really key for phrases like this.</p>
<p>So tell me about it can mean two very different things depending on your intonation, but also what a great connection skill to share with someone.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>connection skill to share with someone that you have this in common, especially when it's something that you're venting about.</p>
<p>I think both are good connection skills, showing you're curious, interested and open and ready to listen.</p>
<p>Right, The first one we talked about.</p>
<p>And then commiserating.</p>
<p>Also, I'm not sure which is stronger, right?</p>
<p>Sometimes it can be very strong to commiserate with people.</p>
<p>We've done episodes about that to share, talk about how you share their pain in a certain way.</p>
<p>It can be a strong connection skill, actually.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>But you're right that the other one is so valuable, too.</p>
<p>We often have students asking us, how can I keep the conversation going?</p>
<p>This is one way, right?</p>
<p>If someone tells you something new, some kind of detail, tell me about it.</p>
<p>Tell me more.</p>
<p>Be genuinely interested.</p>
<p>Ask for more details that will keep the conversation going.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That's kind of a best kept secret of the great conversationalists.</p>
<p>Get the other people to continue talking.</p>
<p>Get the other person to keep talking.</p>
<p>Keep asking them questions.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>We are done for today, but I'll see you in the next episode.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
