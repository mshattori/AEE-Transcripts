<p id="p-20">Good, how are you?</p>
<p id="p-21">Very good, very good.</p>
<p id="p-22">So, Michelle, does it ever take you just a few tries to actually get something right?</p>
<p id="p-23">Of course.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-24">Of course.</p>
<p id="p-25">I don't, I don't get things right on the first time.</p>
<p id="p-26">No.</p>
<p id="p-27">Every time, you know, sometimes, sometimes, of course, but there are those moments when you're trying and you're trying and something's not working, right?</p>
<p id="p-28">It's true.</p>
<p id="p-29">It's true.</p>
<p id="p-30">Things take practice.</p>
<p id="p-31">You know, the timing has to be right.</p>
<p id="p-32">There's, yeah, so most things don't just happen right away.</p>
<p id="p-33">It takes a few tries, right?</p>
<p id="p-34">And we're going to share a very special phrase that is native and natural, and our listeners can use it right away.</p>
<p id="p-35">But first, before we share that phrase, Michelle, what should our listeners do right now?</p>
<p id="p-36">Guys, we want to remind you, if you haven't already, wherever you're listening to All Ears English, please hit the follow button so that you never miss anything from us.</p>
<p id="p-37">Yes, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-38">All right.</p>
<p id="p-39">So, Michelle, what is that phrase then that we can use to say sometimes it takes three tries?</p>
<p id="p-40">Yeah, it's third times a charm.</p>
<p id="p-41">Yes, This is a good one.</p>
<p id="p-42">You'll hear it all the time.</p>
<p id="p-43">Do you use this, Lindsay?</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-44">at all the time.</p>
<p id="p-45">Do you use this, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-46">Yeah, I do use this sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-47">I do.</p>
<p id="p-48">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-49">What does it mean?</p>
<p id="p-50">It means that, you know, you obviously use it when someone has, you know, when I guess you can use it in two scenarios.</p>
<p id="p-51">When someone has tried something twice and they're going for their third try and you're trying to encourage them and you say, hey, you know, could happen this time.</p>
<p id="p-52">Actually, you know what?</p>
<p id="p-53">I'm going to edit that.</p>
<p id="p-54">I think it's more after when you see that it's happened on the third try.</p>
<p id="p-55">Right, That's how I think of it.</p>
<p id="p-56">Yeah, Yeah, I mean, I could be it could be before just to encourage someone.</p>
<p id="p-57">But yeah, I think it's more, oh, you got something right on the third try.</p>
<p id="p-58">And, you know, afterwards, you would say it.</p>
<p id="p-59">That's how I feel like I hear it or I'm more and more likely to use it.</p>
<p id="p-60">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-61">One hundred percent.</p>
<p id="p-62">It's more like, you know, they've succeeded.</p>
<p id="p-63">That's the safest way to use this.</p>
<p id="p-64">And I don't maybe I've been saying this wrong.</p>
<p id="p-65">I usually say third time's the charm.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-66">third time's the charm.</p>
<p id="p-67">Third time's the charm.</p>
<p id="p-68">Third time's the charm.</p>
<p id="p-69">So I've been, I just checked it out again because I started thinking, no, so I, yeah, it can be said multiple ways.</p>
<p id="p-70">So it looks like some people say third time's the charm.</p>
<p id="p-71">Sometimes people might say third time's the charm.</p>
<p id="p-72">I mean, I see there's a, yeah, people ask about which one to say, but I see, I see both so frequently that I'm going to say don't worry about it.</p>
<p id="p-73">But I also sometimes hear three times a charm.</p>
<p id="p-74">Do you ever hear that?</p>
<p id="p-75">That one I haven't heard, but it makes sense.</p>
<p id="p-76">So there's a few variations on this.</p>
<p id="p-77">Clearly, maybe it depends on your region, your, what your family says, your personality, right?</p>
<p id="p-78">Yeah, And again, maybe there's a specific answer, but I found evidence of all of these.</p>
<p id="p-79">So yeah.</p>
<p id="p-80">And all, you know, our take on language is human connection.</p>
<p id="p-81">And if people are using all of these, it means that is the language in many cases where, you know, we're not super strict.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-82">We're not super strict to say that everything has one exact right way to say it, right?</p>
<p id="p-83">Of course, the grammar is grammar and we understand that but when it comes to phrases people adapt these for themselves So who is to say that this person is wrong and that person is right with this phrase, right?</p>
<p id="p-84">We're finding it on the internet it exists.</p>
<p id="p-85">So that's a good way to think about it.</p>
<p id="p-86">I think right I think three times a charm might be less common.</p>
<p id="p-87">Maybe that's something that I just Hear but I would say I hear I the one that I'm more likely to say is third times a charm Maybe in this episode I'll say third times the charm and you say third times the charm and it will it'll be fine It will be So, all right So let's get back to what it means.</p>
<p id="p-88">So for me this expression shows some humor and vulnerability Because you're you're saying oh I couldn't get this.</p>
<p id="p-89">Ah now I got it.</p>
<p id="p-90">So yes, let's do a couple examples So the first one is ah, I can't get this</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-91">The first one is, I can't get this lock open again.</p>
<p id="p-92">Okay, I'll try once more.</p>
<p id="p-93">Got it.</p>
<p id="p-94">Third time's a charm.</p>
<p id="p-95">Or here's another one.</p>
<p id="p-96">I passed my exam.</p>
<p id="p-97">Finally, third time's the charm.</p>
<p id="p-98">Right?</p>
<p id="p-99">So here, yeah, I agree with you, Michelle, humor, self deprecation, vulnerability, because I had to take my exam three times.</p>
<p id="p-100">I'm kind of poking fun at that a little bit when I say third time's the charm.</p>
<p id="p-101">I've seen this with when I was 16 with driver's tests, right?</p>
<p id="p-102">When people had to take their driving test over and over again.</p>
<p id="p-103">Things like that.</p>
<p id="p-104">Right?</p>
<p id="p-105">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-106">Also, I'm thinking of like the bar exam.</p>
<p id="p-107">Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-108">Right?</p>
<p id="p-109">Much harder to retake that.</p>
<p id="p-110">Yeah, So I mean, you can use it to talk about your own efforts, or you can use it to talk about somebody else.</p>
<p id="p-111">So let's do how it might look in a conversation.</p>
<p id="p-112">Okay, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-113">I was so exhausted the first two classes, but by the third class, I got into the groove.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-114">of the third class, I got into the groove.</p>
<p id="p-115">Nice, third time's a charm.</p>
<p id="p-116">Good, yeah, so you're responding and you're commenting here on this person's experience.</p>
<p id="p-117">And again, this is not about passing a test or not passing a test, but it's about settling into something.</p>
<p id="p-118">Also applicable, right?</p>
<p id="p-119">Yes, and let's talk for a second about the tone of voice for it because I think it's said in a very specific way.</p>
<p id="p-120">Lindsay, it's almost like a little song.</p>
<p id="p-121">Yeah, third time's a charm, right?</p>
<p id="p-122">I'm gonna add the third time's the charm, right?</p>
<p id="p-123">It is a little sing-songy, isn't it, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-124">Yes, exactly, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-125">So, and the other thing is this can be a motivating expression as well.</p>
<p id="p-126">So, Lindsay, I am gonna touch on what you brought up at the beginning because I think it is important to bring it up.</p>
<p id="p-127">So, telling someone to keep going, keep trying.</p>
<p id="p-128">So, you know, just if somebody's having a hard time with something, maybe they tried something twice, they might say, try it once more, you know, third time's a charm.</p>
<p id="p-129">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-130">What does that mean, though, a charm?</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-131">What does that mean, though?</p>
<p id="p-132">A charm or the charm?</p>
<p id="p-133">What is the charm?</p>
<p id="p-134">I mean, I don't know the etymology of the phrase.</p>
<p id="p-135">We don't know what it is.</p>
<p id="p-136">These phrases all go back to something somewhere.</p>
<p id="p-137">So we don't know.</p>
<p id="p-138">But a charm is usually signifies good luck.</p>
<p id="p-139">Right, Or success.</p>
<p id="p-140">Yeah, right.</p>
<p id="p-141">Success.</p>
<p id="p-142">Mm hmm.</p>
<p id="p-143">It's almost like charming, I would say, you know, like it just something's worked.</p>
<p id="p-144">It's saying something worked on the third time.</p>
<p id="p-145">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-146">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-147">And can we use this at work, Michelle, as well as in our personalized?</p>
<p id="p-148">Would you use this in a work context?</p>
<p id="p-149">Would you say?</p>
<p id="p-150">I think I think it's fine to do that.</p>
<p id="p-151">I would say just whenever you use it, make sure that it's encouraging or if you're comfortable with close colleagues, you could use it in a self-deprecating way.</p>
<p id="p-152">But I wouldn't necessarily say it to your boss.</p>
<p id="p-153">What do you think?</p>
<p id="p-154">Yeah, Yeah, I would.</p>
<p id="p-155">Because, again, if you're there's a little bit of self-deprecation here in some cases or just look out for that.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-156">Um, just look out for the context, right?</p>
<p id="p-157">Just look out for the context.</p>
<p id="p-158">It could totally be applicable to the work world.</p>
<p id="p-159">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-160">Yeah, Yeah, Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-161">Mm hmm.</p>
<p id="p-162">All right, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-163">So other ways to say this, we don't always have to just say, uh, you know, third time's the charm.</p>
<p id="p-164">We could say other things that are a little more straightforward and simple, right?</p>
<p id="p-165">Mm hmm.</p>
<p id="p-166">So we are going to really hear talk about the context of encouraging someone, um, because I think that's important.</p>
<p id="p-167">I think that's good for connection.</p>
<p id="p-168">So we're going to focus on that for this part of the, for this part of the episode.</p>
<p id="p-169">So one thing you could say is keep going.</p>
<p id="p-170">So yes, I like that.</p>
<p id="p-171">Keep going.</p>
<p id="p-172">Yeah, Yeah, Don't give up.</p>
<p id="p-173">Keep going.</p>
<p id="p-174">Very straightforward, but also very kind way of supporting someone and letting them know that you're on their side and you want them to keep pursuing their goal.</p>
<p id="p-175">Right, The next one, you'll get the next one, right?</p>
<p id="p-176">Keep trying.</p>
<p id="p-177">You'll get the next one.</p>
<p id="p-178">You'll get the next one.</p>
<p id="p-179">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-180">And the next one.</p>
<p id="p-181">So before then switching back a little bit, I finally got it.</p>
<p id="p-182">If you're talking.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-183">it.</p>
<p id="p-184">I finally got it.</p>
<p id="p-185">If you're talking about something that you've been trying for.</p>
<p id="p-186">So because I, ah, I finally got it.</p>
<p id="p-187">Yeah, These are all really accessible for our listeners.</p>
<p id="p-188">And I think you're right, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-189">I think encouraging something is huge, right?</p>
<p id="p-190">Encouraging someone, sorry, to keep going for something.</p>
<p id="p-191">I mean, it's such a part of our narrative in American culture to keep going for something, achieving something, setting a goal and going after it.</p>
<p id="p-192">Any thoughts on that when it comes to connection, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-193">Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-194">If you're able to express that, especially towards somebody else, that's going to be huge for your connection.</p>
<p id="p-195">So just this idea of don't give up and, you know, you can, you can still get it.</p>
<p id="p-196">You can still make it happen.</p>
<p id="p-197">Just try one more time.</p>
<p id="p-198">Right?</p>
<p id="p-199">I think that is hugely ingrained in our culture.</p>
<p id="p-200">And so I think if you're able to express that feeling, showing someone that you believe in them, that's really important.</p>
<p id="p-201">Yeah, that's important.</p>
<p id="p-202">Let's show it all in a little roleplay conversation here.</p>
<p id="p-203">So here we're at a carnival playing a game.</p>
<p id="p-204">Oh, so maybe the</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-205">carnival playing a game.</p>
<p id="p-206">Oh, so maybe the basketball game, for example.</p>
<p id="p-207">Yeah, All right.</p>
<p id="p-208">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-209">Whack-a-mole, maybe.</p>
<p id="p-210">All right.</p>
<p id="p-211">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-212">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-213">So you just throw the ball in the basket.</p>
<p id="p-214">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-215">Ah, missed.</p>
<p id="p-216">Keep going.</p>
<p id="p-217">Keep going.</p>
<p id="p-218">Oh, no.</p>
<p id="p-219">Again.</p>
<p id="p-220">You'll get the next one.</p>
<p id="p-221">Oh, okay.</p>
<p id="p-222">One more time.</p>
<p id="p-223">There you go.</p>
<p id="p-224">Third time's the charm.</p>
<p id="p-225">I finally got it.</p>
<p id="p-226">Yeah, That game where you just throw basketball after basketball constantly, right?</p>
<p id="p-227">Yeah, That's what we're doing.</p>
<p id="p-228">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-229">Yeah, Fun.</p>
<p id="p-230">All right, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-231">So here, yeah, I was standing next to you watching you throw these basketballs and just encouraging you, telling you to keep going, right?</p>
<p id="p-232">Yes, So I first, I missed and you said, keep going.</p>
<p id="p-233">And then I missed again.</p>
<p id="p-234">And you said, you'll get the next one.</p>
<p id="p-235">And then I said, okay, one more time.</p>
<p id="p-236">And then you said, I finally got it.</p>
<p id="p-237">Are you good at that game, Michelle, would you say?</p>
<p id="p-238">No, of course not.</p>
<p id="p-239">Are you?</p>
<p id="p-240">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-241">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-242">Maybe you have like a good shot when it comes to basketball.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-243">a good shot when it comes to basketball.</p>
<p id="p-244">Who knows?</p>
<p id="p-245">Sometimes you surprise us, Michelle, on the show and come up with these hidden talents, right?</p>
<p id="p-246">No, no, no, no.</p>
<p id="p-247">Hand-eye coordination is not one of them.</p>
<p id="p-248">And you said third time's a charm.</p>
<p id="p-249">So yeah, this was just really good.</p>
<p id="p-250">You were encouraging me and you used this expression when I did achieve the goal, I got a basket.</p>
<p id="p-251">So it felt very good, very interactive, also very quick.</p>
<p id="p-252">We could move back and forth quickly with this.</p>
<p id="p-253">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-254">Perfect.</p>
<p id="p-255">So Michelle, was there another episode that our listeners should check out before we finish up?</p>
<p id="p-256">Yes, we had a lot of fun with this one.</p>
<p id="p-257">This was All Ears English, just crickets, what to say when no one responds.</p>
<p id="p-258">That was a really fun episode, right?</p>
<p id="p-259">Yes, yes.</p>
<p id="p-260">Really captures a human, a very human feeling that we all experience at some point in our lives.</p>
<p id="p-261">So check it out.</p>
<p id="p-262">Check out that episode, guys, and hit follow while you're at it.</p>
<p id="p-263">Hit that follow button.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-264">while you're at it.</p>
<p id="p-265">Hit that follow button to make sure that all there's English just drops right into your listening cue five days a week.</p>
<p id="p-266">What's the takeaway today, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-267">Guys, use these to encourage people or to show a little bit of vulnerability when talking about yourself and just being real with people.</p>
<p id="p-268">That's what's going to get that connection flowing.</p>
<p id="p-269">You can even use this to yourself.</p>
<p id="p-270">I mean, if you're trying to open your key or where I am right now, there's just a code to press.</p>
<p id="p-271">Every once in a while, you press.</p>
<p id="p-272">Oh, or what about, Lindsay, when you're at a hotel and they have the key card, and you put it in and it comes up red, and then you put it in again, and then you have that moment where you think, uh-oh, and then you get it on the third time.</p>
<p id="p-273">You say, oh, third time's a charm.</p>
<p id="p-274">This is a very common expression.</p>
<p id="p-275">It'll come up.</p>
<p id="p-276">You'll hear it.</p>
<p id="p-277">It's just kind of a fun thing to say.</p>
<p id="p-278">It's true.</p>
<p id="p-279">There are a lot of these little moments, and this is what I love when we bring it back to connection.</p>
<p id="p-280">Every single one of our listeners</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-281">to connection.</p>
<p id="p-282">Every single one of our listeners is going to be able to relate to these moments.</p>
<p id="p-283">Moments when you try to put the key card in, doesn't work, doesn't work, doesn't work.</p>
<p id="p-284">So we can go through life just cursing those moments, right?</p>
<p id="p-285">And being upset and frustrated or bitter.</p>
<p id="p-286">Or we can say something like, yep, third time's a charm, and then just keep rolling with our day.</p>
<p id="p-287">And my guess is at the end of the day, you'll be happier if you err on the side of say something positive.</p>
<p id="p-288">Okay, so we'll leave it at that, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-289">All right.</p>
<p id="p-290">Well, all right.</p>
<p id="p-291">I'll see you soon.</p>
<p id="p-292">You have a good day.</p>
<p id="p-293">Bye, Lindsay.</p>
