<p id="p-8">One of our listeners heard the phrase attagirl on a TV show and wants to know if you can use it in everyday English.</p>
<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p id="p-9">it in everyday English.</p>
<p id="p-10">Today, we give you all of the context that you need to use or not use this English phrase.</p>
<p id="p-11">Hey there, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-12">How are you doing today?</p>
<p id="p-13">I'm good, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-14">How are you?</p>
<p id="p-15">Good.</p>
<p id="p-16">Feeling good.</p>
<p id="p-17">You have a question today?</p>
<p id="p-18">Yes, When is the last time someone told you, oh no, that you told someone good job for something?</p>
<p id="p-19">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-20">I tell my dog good job all the time for going to the bathroom.</p>
<p id="p-21">I had a feeling you were going to say something about keeper.</p>
<p id="p-22">What about you, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-23">What about you?</p>
<p id="p-24">Probably one of my kids.</p>
<p id="p-25">Who knows what it's been?</p>
<p id="p-26">Oh, maybe doing homework, maybe a homework problem or something.</p>
<p id="p-27">My son is very into math now, so he does a lot of math problems, so that's kind of fun to watch.</p>
<p id="p-28">That's cute.</p>
<p id="p-29">Yeah, Today, we are going to get into a really interesting question.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-30">to a really interesting question from Gianluca from Italy.</p>
<p id="p-31">Lindsay, would you like to read the question?</p>
<p id="p-32">Yeah, I'm going to go ahead and read this right away.</p>
<p id="p-33">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-34">Hello, girls.</p>
<p id="p-35">I'm writing from Italy and I would like to say thank you for your amazing show.</p>
<p id="p-36">Everybody, I can't wait to clock out or every day I can't wait to clock out and listen to your legendary podcast while I'm running on a treadmill.</p>
<p id="p-37">You are my daily pick-me-up.</p>
<p id="p-38">Oh, that is so nice, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-39">We love that.</p>
<p id="p-40">Thank you very much.</p>
<p id="p-41">Thank you so much.</p>
<p id="p-42">I've been listening to you for ages and you've already answered one of my questions in episode 745.</p>
<p id="p-43">It was such an honor.</p>
<p id="p-44">Now, I have another question for you.</p>
<p id="p-45">I was watching one of my favorite series for the nth time, namely Gilmore Girls.</p>
<p id="p-46">I heard a new expression and would like it to be part of my vocabulary, but I didn't understand exactly how to use it and especially whether it was sarcastic or genuine.</p>
<p id="p-47">The expression is, attagirl.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-48">is Attagirl.</p>
<p id="p-49">Thank you so much for your lovely show.</p>
<p id="p-50">You are great.</p>
<p id="p-51">Gianluca from Italy.</p>
<p id="p-52">Wow, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-53">Thanks for that beautiful question and the beautiful words.</p>
<p id="p-54">So really, thank you for listening and for sending in your questions.</p>
<p id="p-55">And we're happy that we can be a part of your day.</p>
<p id="p-56">Yeah, And it is actually a really good question, isn't it, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-57">Oh, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-58">Oh, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-59">This is good stuff.</p>
<p id="p-60">So, all right, let's get into it.</p>
<p id="p-61">Lindsay, what do you think?</p>
<p id="p-62">Do you say or do you hear Attagirl a lot?</p>
<p id="p-63">I don't really say it in less, maybe select times when I'm being very, very sarcastic.</p>
<p id="p-64">But I do hear it.</p>
<p id="p-65">I think there's a place and a time for it.</p>
<p id="p-66">And I can see why Gianluca heard this on Gilmore Girls.</p>
<p id="p-67">I don't really know Gilmore Girls that well, but I think you'd be more likely to hear it on a funny sitcom than anything, honestly.</p>
<p id="p-68">Yeah, Yeah, I don't know Gilmore Girls either, which I feel like I'm the only I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-69">It seems like everybody.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-70">lonely.</p>
<p id="p-71">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-72">It seems like everybody from our generation loved Gilmore Girls.</p>
<p id="p-73">Do you ever feel that way?</p>
<p id="p-74">And I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-75">I just never get into it.</p>
<p id="p-76">Yeah, I never did.</p>
<p id="p-77">You were too busy watching Friends, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-78">I was too busy watching Friends and Seinfeld.</p>
<p id="p-79">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-80">So but okay.</p>
<p id="p-81">So what is attagirl mean?</p>
<p id="p-82">And also Gianluca asked if it's sarcastic or genuine.</p>
<p id="p-83">So what do you think, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-84">Okay, so you mentioned sarcasm already.</p>
<p id="p-85">Well, let's go back to where like what it well, I think it derives from that a girl like that's a girl like it means good job in a way.</p>
<p id="p-86">It's basically saying good job.</p>
<p id="p-87">You did a good job.</p>
<p id="p-88">And we hear this for at a boy as well.</p>
<p id="p-89">We hear it sometimes in different kinds of circles.</p>
<p id="p-90">Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-91">Right, So yeah, it basically means good job.</p>
<p id="p-92">Nice job.</p>
<p id="p-93">It's encouraging.</p>
<p id="p-94">Good job.</p>
<p id="p-95">Keep going.</p>
<p id="p-96">Keep at it.</p>
<p id="p-97">So when when could you use it?</p>
<p id="p-98">Yeah,</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-99">When could you use it?</p>
<p id="p-100">Yeah, so if someone accomplished something, like they got a good grade on a test, they got a part in a play, they won an athletic competition, maybe they got a promotion, right?</p>
<p id="p-101">You got the part, atta girl, I knew you could do it.</p>
<p id="p-102">It's not really in my personality to say this so much.</p>
<p id="p-103">What about you, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-104">Would you, I mean, maybe to your kids, right?</p>
<p id="p-105">But like, would you say it to a friend?</p>
<p id="p-106">It feels a little exaggerated to me.</p>
<p id="p-107">Yeah, I don't know that I really use this very frequently.</p>
<p id="p-108">Now, Gilmore Girls is also not a current show, so it's possible maybe at that time more people were using it, but I don't, I know this, it's one that's great to know, but I wouldn't try and force it into your vocabulary.</p>
<p id="p-109">This is not something to force.</p>
<p id="p-110">This is something to make sure that you've heard it in different places outside of sitcoms, that you're hearing it in your circles, and then maybe try playing around with it, but it's really.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-111">around with it, but it's really, I don't know, it's more of a TV phrase, I think, personally.</p>
<p id="p-112">Yeah, Yeah, I mean, well, it could be when you're, someone is getting the hang of something.</p>
<p id="p-113">What does that mean to get the hang of something?</p>
<p id="p-114">Oh, that's a good one.</p>
<p id="p-115">Getting used to something, starting to learn something.</p>
<p id="p-116">Mm-hmm.</p>
<p id="p-117">Mm-hmm.</p>
<p id="p-118">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-119">So if somebody, for example, I could see it being used if a, someone's child is learning how to ride a bike and then they start going and all of a sudden they're pedaling on their own and they might say, attagirl, you got it, right?</p>
<p id="p-120">I could see it in that way more of a parent to a child.</p>
<p id="p-121">To me, it's a little bit juvenile sounding, maybe a little bit awkward sounding even.</p>
<p id="p-122">Yeah, Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p id="p-123">I agree.</p>
<p id="p-124">I think it's much, much more likely to hear it from a parent to a child or attagirl or thatagirl, right?</p>
<p id="p-125">Thatagirl, like, that's, like, it's kind of like you're saying, that's a good girl or like you're doing a good job.</p>
<p id="p-126">I think that's what it's coming from.</p>
<p id="p-127">I don't actually even know what it's coming from.</p>
<p id="p-128">Yeah, I don't even know.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-129">Yeah, I don't even know, really, either.</p>
<p id="p-130">But so let's talk about, so Gianluca asked if it could be used sarcastically.</p>
<p id="p-131">I mean, you could.</p>
<p id="p-132">You could say something like, attagirl, you finally caught a fish, right?</p>
<p id="p-133">You're fishing with your friend.</p>
<p id="p-134">They're terrible at it, and they can't get it.</p>
<p id="p-135">And then they finally got one, and they finally did it.</p>
<p id="p-136">So in kind of a humorous way, I could actually hear that more likely than in the genuine way, because it's Between adults, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-137">Yeah, right.</p>
<p id="p-138">Because you're not, yeah, no one's an attagirl in a real genuine way.</p>
<p id="p-139">It is more, if you're going to use it, either I would say use it with a child or use it kind of in a sarcastic, funny, teasing way with an adult.</p>
<p id="p-140">I completely agree, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-141">That's well put.</p>
<p id="p-142">I would not use it seriously with another adult, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-143">Yeah, because first of all, you are saying girl, and it's a woman, an adult, right, that you're talking to.</p>
<p id="p-144">Yeah,</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-145">right?</p>
<p id="p-146">That you're talking to in theory.</p>
<p id="p-147">And then it's just it's it's sarcastic.</p>
<p id="p-148">It's a little condescending, not condescending, but it's it's playful.</p>
<p id="p-149">It's silly.</p>
<p id="p-150">It's right.</p>
<p id="p-151">It's silly.</p>
<p id="p-152">That's why it's perfect for Gilmore Girls.</p>
<p id="p-153">I'm sure it's a silly, funny show, right?</p>
<p id="p-154">It makes sense.</p>
<p id="p-155">Yeah, right, right, right.</p>
<p id="p-156">Yeah, I wonder.</p>
<p id="p-157">Well, and it's also about a parent.</p>
<p id="p-158">Isn't it about a mom and a daughter?</p>
<p id="p-159">And so, okay, okay, that makes sense.</p>
<p id="p-160">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-161">Well, I don't know exactly how it was used.</p>
<p id="p-162">Of course, we're not exactly sure how it was used in this context, but that's our opinion on it.</p>
<p id="p-163">Yeah, All Ears English is sponsored by Cambly.</p>

<p id="p-178">What about attaboy?</p>
<p id="p-179">I mean, you could say it too, right?</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-180">I mean, you could say it too, right?</p>
<p id="p-181">Same idea, I think.</p>
<p id="p-182">Lindsey, would you say that to Kiefer?</p>
<p id="p-183">Atta boy.</p>
<p id="p-184">I say good boy, like if he goes to the bathroom.</p>
<p id="p-185">But when I think about atta boy around adults, between adults, I think of old boy networks.</p>
<p id="p-186">I think of maybe kind of more, sometimes maybe a toxic culture at times around guys saying like, oh, that he slept with his girlfriend or something and his friends would say, atta boy, atta boy, like congratulating them on steps in life, different steps in life.</p>
<p id="p-187">Uh-huh, interesting.</p>
<p id="p-188">Which isn't always toxic necessarily, but can get that way, right?</p>
<p id="p-189">Right, right, right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-190">That's interesting.</p>
<p id="p-191">Yeah, so just in general, it's not my favorite expression.</p>
<p id="p-192">I don't use it frequently, but there are ways you could throw it in, but again, I wouldn't say, you know.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-193">Again, I wouldn't say, you know, Gianluca, I wouldn't say you should really be trying to, okay, now I want to try and use attagirl, attaboy.</p>
<p id="p-194">You could take it or leave it.</p>
<p id="p-195">Right?</p>
<p id="p-196">It's not something to force, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-197">But there's so many more important things to learn that can be planned and prepared and delivered at the right moment.</p>
<p id="p-198">This one might come up at some point, but you want to be hearing it a lot.</p>
<p id="p-199">Okay?</p>
<p id="p-200">Yeah, Should we do a role play, Michelle, and see what it looks like live, even though we don't necessarily use it a ton or recommend it that much?</p>
<p id="p-201">Right, Yeah, Right, And just to give you an idea, you know, you could also say something like, that's my girl, right, about, to your daughter, right?</p>
<p id="p-202">I could see if, okay, my daughter is going to be starting potty training.</p>
<p id="p-203">I could say, oh, that's my girl, if she does a good job, or that's my boy, but, you know, you really have to think about the relationship, but there's always other more neutral ones like you got this or amazing job, right?</p>
<p id="p-204">Yeah, I just want to build out the other piece, adult to adult scenario.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-205">piece, adult-to-adult scenarios, for example.</p>
<p id="p-206">So you have some good examples about talking to your kids, but adults-to-adults, let's say on a college campus, they have like rush week, right?</p>
<p id="p-207">And you're rushing a fraternity and they basically like force pledges to drink a lot of alcohol, or at least they used to.</p>
<p id="p-208">I think that's coming down a little bit now, but that might be something like you do a keg stand or something and people are like, attaboy, keg stand.</p>
<p id="p-209">Or on the football team.</p>
<p id="p-210">It's kind of a bro-y sort of thing.</p>
<p id="p-211">It's kind of a masculine thing to say.</p>
<p id="p-212">So it'd be unlikely to see like a woman say that to a man maybe unless she's kind of punching his shoulder and also being sarcastic.</p>
<p id="p-213">Right, Right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-214">So our recommendation, probably leave this one.</p>
<p id="p-215">There's a lot of context behind it, isn't there?</p>
<p id="p-216">Yeah, Yeah, there really is.</p>
<p id="p-217">But let's do a role play to show how it might be.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-218">So let's do a role play to show how it might be used.</p>
<p id="p-219">So here we are, two friends, and we are on a run.</p>
<p id="p-220">OK, OK, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-221">I can't go any faster.</p>
<p id="p-222">Lift your knees, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-223">Lift your knees.</p>
<p id="p-224">Ah! Atta girl.</p>
<p id="p-225">You got this.</p>
<p id="p-226">Ah, I'm so tired.</p>
<p id="p-227">Amazing job, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-228">You did it.</p>
<p id="p-229">Ah, thanks.</p>
<p id="p-230">Oh, no.</p>
<p id="p-231">That's a rough run.</p>
<p id="p-232">You're struggling there.</p>
<p id="p-233">OK, In this case, I strategically used it to encourage you.</p>
<p id="p-234">But in terms of my personality, there's other things I would have said.</p>
<p id="p-235">I love to encourage people to keep running, keep going, good job.</p>
<p id="p-236">But I would have said something like, good job, you got this, or keep going.</p>
<p id="p-237">Just different things.</p>
<p id="p-238">I probably wouldn't have chosen atta girl.</p>
<p id="p-239">Right, right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-240">But you did say it.</p>
<p id="p-241">You said atta girl.</p>
<p id="p-242">You got this.</p>
<p id="p-243">And then you said, amazing job, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-244">So yeah, probably you're not going to hear this too much.</p>
<p id="p-245">Probably you're going to hear it on TV.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-246">Probably you're gonna hear it on TV or yeah, it I could see a movie with a frat or something but I've actually never seen it.</p>
<p id="p-247">But of course I know of it.</p>
<p id="p-248">Should I see it?</p>
<p id="p-249">I don't know I've never seen it either, but I know about college life and frat parties and yeah dudes in college So that's where you might see it.</p>
<p id="p-250">But yeah, it might be a little dated Although it looks like Gilmore Girls just came out in 2000 in the year 2000.</p>
<p id="p-251">Although that's already a while back.</p>
<p id="p-252">I know Yeah, it might be a little dated So maybe it's not your first go-to phrase now, but it's always good to be looking for little phrases to encourage people I think yeah.</p>
<p id="p-253">Yeah, absolutely absolutely so another episode you guys should check out is Episode 2173 that was stay cool with this popular native saying All right, and then that is the takeaway.</p>
<p id="p-254">So be selective about what you decide to</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-255">So, be selective about what you decide to use.</p>
<p id="p-256">Make sure you're hearing it around you a lot before you go and deploy one of these phrases that you hear on TV and come to us with what you hear on TV and we'll let you know whether that's appropriate to use, whether it's dated or what it means, what the undertones are to those phrases.</p>
<p id="p-257">All right?</p>
<p id="p-258">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-259">Well, this was a great question.</p>
<p id="p-260">Thanks for bringing this to us and I'm glad we could chat about it today.</p>
