<p id="p-23">Hey there, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-24">How's it going today?</p>
<p id="p-25">Good, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-26">Lindsay, have you ever had jury duty?</p>
<p id="p-27">I actually have recently, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-28">I was called in and you go through stages.</p>
<p id="p-29">You get a mailing and then you have to call the night before and find out if your number was called.</p>
<p id="p-30">My number was called, so that means you go in that day and then you watch the videos.</p>
<p id="p-31">And then if your number gets called again, you're actually on the selection process.</p>
<p id="p-32">So it's like three rounds that you have to be lucky or unlucky, depending on how you think of it.</p>
<p id="p-33">My number did not get called that time.</p>
<p id="p-34">What about you, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-35">Yes, I have had it.</p>
<p id="p-36">I've had it in New York.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-37">I've had it in New York and I remember I actually made it to the voir dire.</p>
<p id="p-38">The voir dire is voir dire.</p>
<p id="p-39">Yes, Yeah, And they give me a microphone and yeah, I did.</p>
<p id="p-40">And they asked me questions and I remember I was really nervous because it was right before kind of a break in my schedule or I had planned to go home.</p>
<p id="p-41">I think I said something to the judge and they were like, sorry, you know.</p>
<p id="p-42">But then luckily I didn't get chosen after the voir dire.</p>
<p id="p-43">They didn't like you as a jury then.</p>
<p id="p-44">As a juror, I guess is the word.</p>
<p id="p-45">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-46">What about courtroom dramas?</p>
<p id="p-47">Do you watch anything like Law &amp; Order?</p>
<p id="p-48">Of course.</p>
<p id="p-49">Of course.</p>
<p id="p-50">And there was a great movie called Jury Duty actually.</p>
<p id="p-51">And the TV show.</p>
<p id="p-52">Yeah, I highly recommend the movie.</p>
<p id="p-53">I remember thinking it was really funny or really good or something.</p>
<p id="p-54">Yeah, I've seen the courtroom dramas, you know, the crime shows, the true crime series.</p>
<p id="p-55">They're everywhere.</p>
<p id="p-56">I think most of what we learn about juries and trials is that</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-57">and Trials is actually on TV.</p>
<p id="p-58">Yes, or movies like I was thinking you and I have talked many times about My Cousin Vinny.</p>
<p id="p-59">Michelle, I have an update there.</p>
<p id="p-60">I actually watched that over the weekend.</p>
<p id="p-61">Oh, did you?</p>
<p id="p-62">Yes, I watched it over the weekend.</p>
<p id="p-63">Amazing.</p>
<p id="p-64">Still, right?</p>
<p id="p-65">It's such a good movie.</p>
<p id="p-66">But you know what?</p>
<p id="p-67">The second time or the third time, whatever time it was, I remember it being funnier the first time I watched it.</p>
<p id="p-68">This time, it was funny, but it wasn't like stitches funny.</p>
<p id="p-69">You know, I've got stitches in my belly funny.</p>
<p id="p-70">Yeah, It's good.</p>
<p id="p-71">It was a clever movie.</p>
<p id="p-72">Also, it's just fun because it's from the 80s.</p>
<p id="p-73">Yeah, Yeah, Oh, I love that movie.</p>
<p id="p-74">Yeah, Oh, that's so funny that we're talking about this then.</p>
<p id="p-75">So perfect.</p>
<p id="p-76">Guys, before we get into it, we want to let you know that we are going to have a poll on Spotify that we announced at the end of the episode, towards the end.</p>
<p id="p-77">And yeah, we have a lot of fun with these because we ask you guys a question.</p>
<p id="p-78">And if you're listening on Spotify, you can put your answer in.</p>
<p id="p-79">And some of them, like this one, we will read.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-80">Some of them, like this one, we will read on a future show.</p>
<p id="p-81">So we will read actually what the results were.</p>
<p id="p-82">So it's a really fun way to interact with us.</p>
<p id="p-83">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-84">And we'll get to that at the end of the episode.</p>
<p id="p-85">So stick with us here.</p>
<p id="p-86">But today we're going to have this fun episode about idioms that come from the courtroom.</p>
<p id="p-87">And I think it probably is the fact that courts and trials and juries are so embedded in our psyche due to the media.</p>
<p id="p-88">We actually use a lot of idioms, a lot of law idioms in everyday life, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-89">What do you think?</p>
<p id="p-90">Why?</p>
<p id="p-91">Why do you think we use them?</p>
<p id="p-92">Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p id="p-93">I would say that it's on TV.</p>
<p id="p-94">I mean, there's 100 different law and orders.</p>
<p id="p-95">And people seem to just gravitate towards courtroom stuff.</p>
<p id="p-96">They do.</p>
<p id="p-97">And so, yeah, I think it's just seeped its way into our natural vocabulary.</p>
<p id="p-98">Yes, people love, maybe they like justice.</p>
<p id="p-99">They like the truth.</p>
<p id="p-100">It seems dramatic and exciting, these jury trials.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-101">exciting, these jury trials, right?</p>
<p id="p-102">Lawyers, trial lawyers have to really think on their feet and be creative and also very smart.</p>
<p id="p-103">So it's kind of inspiring in a sense.</p>
<p id="p-104">Watching.</p>
<p id="p-105">Yeah, Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p id="p-106">So again, these expressions that we're going to teach, they use courtroom kind of lingo, but they're not used.</p>
<p id="p-107">You don't have to be talking about the court, right?</p>
<p id="p-108">Yes, we don't have to go.</p>
<p id="p-109">We don't have to be in a jury trial.</p>
<p id="p-110">Hopefully you're not, right?</p>
<p id="p-111">To use these expressions, right?</p>
<p id="p-112">We don't want to be in courtrooms.</p>
<p id="p-113">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-114">So, Lindsay, we did want to announce our Android app reviewers, right?</p>
<p id="p-115">Yeah, I just want to say a special shout out to one recent reviewer.</p>
<p id="p-116">Special thank you to Kazra, who reviewed us on February 27th, 2025 with a five-star review.</p>
<p id="p-117">You know, we love seeing these reviews, guys.</p>
<p id="p-118">They are huge for us because we do this podcast for you.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-119">We do this podcast for you.</p>
<p id="p-120">So huge thank you to Khazra.</p>
<p id="p-121">And Michelle, what can our listeners do if they want to hear their name on the show?</p>
<p id="p-122">Definitely go wherever you're listening to us and leave us a review because we do read them.</p>
<p id="p-123">Lindsay sends them around and I always read them and they make us smile.</p>
<p id="p-124">And you can even ask a question in your review.</p>
<p id="p-125">Yes, Just to know that we'll directly be reading that review.</p>
<p id="p-126">So go ahead and leave it, guys.</p>
<p id="p-127">We'll try to announce your name on the show.</p>
<p id="p-128">All right, Michelle, let's get into it.</p>
<p id="p-129">So where does jury and courtroom language show up in everyday English outside of court?</p>
<p id="p-130">Yes, So one thing sometimes people say is what's the verdict?</p>
<p id="p-131">Right, Do you ever hear people say that or you say that?</p>
<p id="p-132">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-133">Oh, yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-134">So what is the verdict?</p>
<p id="p-135">I mean, I'm not asking what's the verdict, but what is a verdict, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-136">A verdict.</p>
<p id="p-137">It's kind of this is the decision that the jury comes to.</p>
<p id="p-138">So the verdict, guilty, not guilty, right?</p>
<p id="p-139">Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-140">What's the decision?</p>
<p id="p-141">So someone...</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-142">So someone has been thinking about something in everyday language, someone's been considering something.</p>
<p id="p-143">Maybe they're thinking of taking a new job, for example, right?</p>
<p id="p-144">Or it's something lighter, like where do you want to go for lunch?</p>
<p id="p-145">I gave you some time to think about it.</p>
<p id="p-146">And Michelle, what's a sample sentence then?</p>
<p id="p-147">Yeah, so yeah, what's the verdict on lunch?</p>
<p id="p-148">Are we getting Thai, right?</p>
<p id="p-149">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-150">What was the outcome of the decision?</p>
<p id="p-151">What did you decide?</p>
<p id="p-152">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-153">And the key thing to know here, this is a real nuance, Michelle, but I feel like there needs to be a gap of time in which someone has been thinking about it, right?</p>
<p id="p-154">Let's say I called you in the morning and we're both at work.</p>
<p id="p-155">I say, hey, Michelle, you want to get lunch today?</p>
<p id="p-156">Sure.</p>
<p id="p-157">And you say sure.</p>
<p id="p-158">And then I say, can you think of where you want to go?</p>
<p id="p-159">And when we meet up, we can decide.</p>
<p id="p-160">So I gave you the choice, and I know that you're thinking about it.</p>
<p id="p-161">And then when we come back together, I'm going to say to you, so Michelle, what's the verdict on lunch?</p>
<p id="p-162">Verdict on lunch?</p>
<p id="p-163">Right, Don't you think there needs to be... Yeah, well, there needs to be that time, and I guess...</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-164">There needs to be that time.</p>
<p id="p-165">And I guess that comes, if you think about it, makes sense with the courtroom, right?</p>
<p id="p-166">The verdict is after some deliberation amongst the jury.</p>
<p id="p-167">So it's not, I wouldn't say to you, Lindsay, what do you want to do for lunch?</p>
<p id="p-168">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-169">And they say, what's the verdict?</p>
<p id="p-170">That makes no sense.</p>
<p id="p-171">And actually that's fun because that leads directly into our next one.</p>
<p id="p-172">The jury's still out.</p>
<p id="p-173">So the jury's out, right?</p>
<p id="p-174">Deciding where you want to go for lunch.</p>
<p id="p-175">We're just doing these fun little analogies here.</p>
<p id="p-176">So with the verdict piece, someone needs to have been thinking about something.</p>
<p id="p-177">Okay?</p>
<p id="p-178">So I wouldn't just say, hey, what do you want to do tonight?</p>
<p id="p-179">What's the verdict?</p>
<p id="p-180">No, that doesn't really work, right?</p>
<p id="p-181">No, no, no, no.</p>
<p id="p-182">There needs to be time.</p>
<p id="p-183">So with the jury still being out, the jury hasn't decided yet.</p>
<p id="p-184">There's no decision yet.</p>
<p id="p-185">So you could say the jury's out or you could even say the jury's still out.</p>
<p id="p-186">Either one.</p>
<p id="p-187">But what's an example with that?</p>
<p id="p-188">Okay, you could say the jury's still out as to whether or not school will be closed for snow tomorrow.</p>
<p id="p-189">And I don't know.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-190">No tomorrow.</p>
<p id="p-191">And I don't know what your thoughts are on kind of belaboring an analogy, but I probably wouldn't continue with that same line.</p>
<p id="p-192">Like if I asked you, what's the verdict on lunch?</p>
<p id="p-193">And you probably wouldn't say, oh, I don't know, the jury's still out.</p>
<p id="p-194">You probably wouldn't say that, right?</p>
<p id="p-195">That's too much, right?</p>
<p id="p-196">I mean, unless I was trying to be super, you know, I don't know, humorous or whatever.</p>
<p id="p-197">But no, I wouldn't. No.</p>
<p id="p-198">No.</p>
<p id="p-199">It doesn't mean we have to continue with these same, I guess it's kind of analogies in a sense.</p>
<p id="p-200">What's the word I'm looking for?</p>
<p id="p-201">Metaphors or I'm not sure, but it's too much.</p>
<p id="p-202">It just gets a little overwhelming.</p>
<p id="p-203">Yeah, Snow days, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-204">Do you remember being a kid and just like looking at the bottom of the TV to see if your school was closed or if the jury was still out?</p>
<p id="p-205">Yeah, And I remember there was a number we could call either TV downstairs or a number and I had memorized, you know, your school administrative unit district, right?</p>
<p id="p-206">And then you're waiting for that SAU 29.</p>
<p id="p-207">Come on, say it.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-208">at SAU 29.</p>
<p id="p-209">Come on, say it, say it.</p>
<p id="p-210">Yep, yep, yep, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-211">So a lot of, jury was still out.</p>
<p id="p-212">Anyway.</p>
<p id="p-213">Yeah, so funny.</p>
<p id="p-214">All right.</p>
<p id="p-215">Okay, so now, Michelle, we have another great one, super relevant in everyday life and culture.</p>
<p id="p-216">What is it?</p>
<p id="p-217">This is to plead the fifth.</p>
<p id="p-218">Yes, Now, yeah, let's get into the amendments a little bit.</p>
<p id="p-219">Lindsay, what is this about?</p>
<p id="p-220">Okay, this is talking about the Fifth Amendment in the Constitution, the amendment of not having to self-incriminate.</p>
<p id="p-221">So you don't have to say anything.</p>
<p id="p-222">If lawyers ask you questions or the DA, the district attorney is asking you questions, you can plead the fifth.</p>
<p id="p-223">And we see this a lot on crime shows.</p>
<p id="p-224">And also when people first get arrested, they're read their, what do they call them, the Miranda rights.</p>
<p id="p-225">And I think the Fifth Amendment is probably one of them.</p>
<p id="p-226">I'm guessing.</p>
<p id="p-227">I'm guessing.</p>
<p id="p-228">I don't know.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-229">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-230">But yeah, and whenever somebody says plead the fifth, you get this feeling of it's guilty.</p>
<p id="p-231">You know what I mean?</p>
<p id="p-232">Maybe it's not true.</p>
<p id="p-233">But at least in fun language, that's how it's used.</p>
<p id="p-234">Right, If you're kind of guilty of something.</p>
<p id="p-235">So let's do this little role play.</p>
<p id="p-236">Yeah, let's take this back to a normal situation at home, right?</p>
<p id="p-237">Hey, did you eat the last cookie?</p>
<p id="p-238">I plead the fifth.</p>
<p id="p-239">Yeah, so we're not in a courtroom here.</p>
<p id="p-240">Right, we're not being arrested.</p>
<p id="p-241">It's more like, oh, yeah, I probably did, but I'm just being playful and I'm not going to admit that I did.</p>
<p id="p-242">Right, right.</p>
<p id="p-243">I'm saying I did.</p>
<p id="p-244">Essentially, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-245">You're saying you did.</p>
<p id="p-246">Okay, that's an important piece.</p>
<p id="p-247">Case closed, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-248">Case closed.</p>
<p id="p-249">Yeah, this means the case has ended.</p>
<p id="p-250">The judge is moving on to the next one.</p>
<p id="p-251">Right?</p>
<p id="p-252">Yeah, this is fun.</p>
<p id="p-253">This episode is fun.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-254">Yeah, this is fun.</p>
<p id="p-255">This episode is fun.</p>
<p id="p-256">So essentially outside of the courtroom, which is where we all exist, it means this is over or this has been resolved.</p>
<p id="p-257">We're no longer talking about this thing, right?</p>
<p id="p-258">Maybe you've been debating this for a while.</p>
<p id="p-259">And this could be used in more serious arguments between spouses maybe, right?</p>
<p id="p-260">Like you want to live in the city and maybe he wants to live in the countryside and you've been debating for years.</p>
<p id="p-261">And then finally you decide, okay, case closed.</p>
<p id="p-262">We've decided this, right?</p>
<p id="p-263">Yep, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-264">Or it could be used in a much lighter way, like this is the best ice cream ever, case closed.</p>
<p id="p-265">Nice, I like that.</p>
<p id="p-266">So you can see the range for that one is pretty wide in terms of scenarios.</p>
<p id="p-267">Yeah, very much so.</p>
<p id="p-268">Lindsay, which of these do you like the most?</p>
<p id="p-269">Oh my gosh, I really like, I like the jury still out.</p>
<p id="p-270">I think that's kind of fun.</p>
<p id="p-271">The jury's still out because it means a decision is still being made about something.</p>
<p id="p-272">And often that's the place we live where we hang out in the world is we're ruminating over something.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-273">We're ruminating over something or we're thinking about something, you know, and taking our time.</p>
<p id="p-274">So the jury's still out.</p>
<p id="p-275">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-276">So let's get into our poll for today, guys.</p>
<p id="p-277">Again, you're going to see this on Spotify.</p>
<p id="p-278">So the question is, do you like to watch courtroom shows?</p>
<p id="p-279">Yes or no?</p>
<p id="p-280">So we want to know who's into those kinds of shows.</p>
<p id="p-281">Yes, And if you're listening in YouTube, Michelle, let's throw this out there.</p>
<p id="p-282">If you are watching today in YouTube, you can answer this too.</p>
<p id="p-283">Answer the poll in the comments, but tell us what is your favorite.</p>
<p id="p-284">So answer yes or no.</p>
<p id="p-285">But then if it's yes, you have a place to make a comment.</p>
<p id="p-286">So tell us what is your favorite courtroom drama.</p>
<p id="p-287">We're looking for recommendations.</p>
<p id="p-288">Right, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-289">All right.</p>
<p id="p-290">Perfect.</p>
<p id="p-291">All right.</p>
<p id="p-292">Let's do a role play, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-293">All right.</p>
<p id="p-294">So here we are friends and we're trying to figure out who forgot to pay their dinner bill on Venmo after a group dinner.</p>
<p id="p-295">So again, we're going to use these expressions.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-296">We're going to use these expressions, but as Lindsay mentioned earlier, you probably wouldn't use them all like this.</p>
<p id="p-297">Yes, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-298">You wouldn't belabor that too much, right?</p>
<p id="p-299">It just gets a little tacky.</p>
<p id="p-300">Yeah, it's a little much.</p>
<p id="p-301">Unless you're having fun.</p>
<p id="p-302">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-303">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-304">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-305">All right.</p>
<p id="p-306">So you paid?</p>
<p id="p-307">Yeah, Okay.</p>
<p id="p-308">So the jury's still out as to who didn't Venmo you yet?</p>
<p id="p-309">Yeah, I have to look through.</p>
<p id="p-310">Who ordered the giant cake?</p>
<p id="p-311">Oh, I plead the fifth, but I paid for it.</p>
<p id="p-312">Okay, good.</p>
<p id="p-313">And what's the verdict on the restaurant for next week?</p>
<p id="p-314">Undecided.</p>
<p id="p-315">Just because I hope whoever it is pays me back by then.</p>
<p id="p-316">Oh, wait.</p>
<p id="p-317">I just got an alert.</p>
<p id="p-318">Jared just paid.</p>
<p id="p-319">All good now.</p>
<p id="p-320">Oh, good.</p>
<p id="p-321">Case closed.</p>
<p id="p-322">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-323">We're going to investigate Jared if he doesn't pay.</p>
<p id="p-324">Yes, All right.</p>
<p id="p-325">So here we have a bunch of idioms, fun idioms.</p>
<p id="p-326">And first you said, so you paid?</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-327">I said, who, so you paid?</p>
<p id="p-328">Clearly you're looking to figure out who needs to pay.</p>
<p id="p-329">And then I said, okay, so the jury's still out as to who didn't Venmo yet, right?</p>
<p id="p-330">Right, so we don't know who it was, right?</p>
<p id="p-331">And just to pay attention to the grammar here, the jury's still out as to something, right?</p>
<p id="p-332">So I want our listeners to pay attention to that.</p>
<p id="p-333">We need the grammar to make this work, right?</p>
<p id="p-334">The jury is still out as to something.</p>
<p id="p-335">And again, this is a little bit different because it's not like, oh, the decision being made, right?</p>
<p id="p-336">The jury being out, but it's still, I think it's just used also in terms of something is still a mystery.</p>
<p id="p-337">Yeah, we're figuring something out.</p>
<p id="p-338">Yeah, you're figuring something out.</p>
<p id="p-339">There's a mystery.</p>
<p id="p-340">You've got to do some research maybe.</p>
<p id="p-341">Yes, yes.</p>
<p id="p-342">Then what?</p>
<p id="p-343">I said, who ordered the giant cake?</p>
<p id="p-344">And it was me, and I'm admitting it here, right?</p>
<p id="p-345">As we said, ooh, I plead the fifth, but I paid for it.</p>
<p id="p-346">And it's funny because by saying I plead the fifth, you're saying I ordered the...</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-347">You're saying I did it.</p>
<p id="p-348">Yeah, Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-349">Cause I didn't even ask you specifically, but you just, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-350">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-351">It's so funny.</p>
<p id="p-352">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-353">And I said, and what's the verdict on the restaurant for next week?</p>
<p id="p-354">So sounds like we do kind of a, maybe a weekly dinner or we just know that.</p>
<p id="p-355">Yeah, And we're deciding.</p>
<p id="p-356">So I'm saying what's the decision.</p>
<p id="p-357">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-358">Excellent.</p>
<p id="p-359">What's the verdict?</p>
<p id="p-360">Good.</p>
<p id="p-361">And then we went down to the bottom and you said, oh, Jared just paid all good now.</p>
<p id="p-362">And then I say, oh good.</p>
<p id="p-363">Case closed.</p>
<p id="p-364">Yeah, So that just means we figured it out.</p>
<p id="p-365">We're moving on.</p>
<p id="p-366">That issue is all set.</p>
<p id="p-367">Yeah, Good.</p>
<p id="p-368">Fun episode today, Michelle, especially because these actually, you know, we're not just making this up here, guys.</p>
<p id="p-369">Like these, we genuinely do use these expressions in everyday life.</p>
<p id="p-370">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-371">Yeah, That's why I, that's where I got the idea because I said, I said one of these in real life.</p>
<p id="p-372">So, and then I was like, oh, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-373">They're fun.</p>
<p id="p-374">Anyway, guys, check out episode 2382, drive safe or drive safely, when to use</p>

<p id="p-381">Oh, I plead the fifth.</p>
<p id="p-382">So, you know, just listen for these.</p>
