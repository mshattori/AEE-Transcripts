<p>Hey there, Michelle.</p>
<p>How's it going today?</p>
<p>Good, Lindsay.</p>
<p>Lindsay, have you ever had jury duty?</p>
<p>I actually have recently, Michelle.</p>
<p>I was called in and you go through stages.</p>
<p>You get a mailing and then you have to call the night before and find out if your number was called.</p>
<p>My number was called, so that means you go in that day and then you watch the videos.</p>
<p>And then if your number gets called again, you're actually on the selection process.</p>
<p>So it's like three rounds that you have to be lucky or unlucky, depending on how you think of it.</p>
<p>My number did not get called that time.</p>
<p>What about you, Michelle?</p>
<p>Yes, I have had it.</p>
<p>I've had it in New York.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>I've had it in New York and I remember I actually made it to the voir dire.</p>
<p>The voir dire is voir dire.</p>
<p>Yes, Yeah, And they give me a microphone and yeah, I did.</p>
<p>And they asked me questions and I remember I was really nervous because it was right before kind of a break in my schedule or I had planned to go home.</p>
<p>I think I said something to the judge and they were like, sorry, you know.</p>
<p>But then luckily I didn't get chosen after the voir dire.</p>
<p>They didn't like you as a jury then.</p>
<p>As a juror, I guess is the word.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>What about courtroom dramas?</p>
<p>Do you watch anything like Law &amp; Order?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>And there was a great movie called Jury Duty actually.</p>
<p>And the TV show.</p>
<p>Yeah, I highly recommend the movie.</p>
<p>I remember thinking it was really funny or really good or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, I've seen the courtroom dramas, you know, the crime shows, the true crime series.</p>
<p>They're everywhere.</p>
<p>I think most of what we learn about juries and trials is that</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>and Trials is actually on TV.</p>
<p>Yes, or movies like I was thinking you and I have talked many times about My Cousin Vinny.</p>
<p>Michelle, I have an update there.</p>
<p>I actually watched that over the weekend.</p>
<p>Oh, did you?</p>
<p>Yes, I watched it over the weekend.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>Still, right?</p>
<p>It's such a good movie.</p>
<p>But you know what?</p>
<p>The second time or the third time, whatever time it was, I remember it being funnier the first time I watched it.</p>
<p>This time, it was funny, but it wasn't like stitches funny.</p>
<p>You know, I've got stitches in my belly funny.</p>
<p>Yeah, It's good.</p>
<p>It was a clever movie.</p>
<p>Also, it's just fun because it's from the 80s.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, Oh, I love that movie.</p>
<p>Yeah, Oh, that's so funny that we're talking about this then.</p>
<p>So perfect.</p>
<p>Guys, before we get into it, we want to let you know that we are going to have a poll on Spotify that we announced at the end of the episode, towards the end.</p>
<p>And yeah, we have a lot of fun with these because we ask you guys a question.</p>
<p>And if you're listening on Spotify, you can put your answer in.</p>
<p>And some of them, like this one, we will read.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>Some of them, like this one, we will read on a future show.</p>
<p>So we will read actually what the results were.</p>
<p>So it's a really fun way to interact with us.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And we'll get to that at the end of the episode.</p>
<p>So stick with us here.</p>
<p>But today we're going to have this fun episode about idioms that come from the courtroom.</p>
<p>And I think it probably is the fact that courts and trials and juries are so embedded in our psyche due to the media.</p>
<p>We actually use a lot of idioms, a lot of law idioms in everyday life, Michelle.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why do you think we use them?</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>I would say that it's on TV.</p>
<p>I mean, there's 100 different law and orders.</p>
<p>And people seem to just gravitate towards courtroom stuff.</p>
<p>They do.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, I think it's just seeped its way into our natural vocabulary.</p>
<p>Yes, people love, maybe they like justice.</p>
<p>They like the truth.</p>
<p>It seems dramatic and exciting, these jury trials.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>exciting, these jury trials, right?</p>
<p>Lawyers, trial lawyers have to really think on their feet and be creative and also very smart.</p>
<p>So it's kind of inspiring in a sense.</p>
<p>Watching.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>So again, these expressions that we're going to teach, they use courtroom kind of lingo, but they're not used.</p>
<p>You don't have to be talking about the court, right?</p>
<p>Yes, we don't have to go.</p>
<p>We don't have to be in a jury trial.</p>
<p>Hopefully you're not, right?</p>
<p>To use these expressions, right?</p>
<p>We don't want to be in courtrooms.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So, Lindsay, we did want to announce our Android app reviewers, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I just want to say a special shout out to one recent reviewer.</p>
<p>Special thank you to Kazra, who reviewed us on February 27th, 2025 with a five-star review.</p>
<p>You know, we love seeing these reviews, guys.</p>
<p>They are huge for us because we do this podcast for you.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>We do this podcast for you.</p>
<p>So huge thank you to Khazra.</p>
<p>And Michelle, what can our listeners do if they want to hear their name on the show?</p>
<p>Definitely go wherever you're listening to us and leave us a review because we do read them.</p>
<p>Lindsay sends them around and I always read them and they make us smile.</p>
<p>And you can even ask a question in your review.</p>
<p>Yes, Just to know that we'll directly be reading that review.</p>
<p>So go ahead and leave it, guys.</p>
<p>We'll try to announce your name on the show.</p>
<p>All right, Michelle, let's get into it.</p>
<p>So where does jury and courtroom language show up in everyday English outside of court?</p>
<p>Yes, So one thing sometimes people say is what's the verdict?</p>
<p>Right, Do you ever hear people say that or you say that?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>So what is the verdict?</p>
<p>I mean, I'm not asking what's the verdict, but what is a verdict, Michelle?</p>
<p>A verdict.</p>
<p>It's kind of this is the decision that the jury comes to.</p>
<p>So the verdict, guilty, not guilty, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>What's the decision?</p>
<p>So someone...</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>So someone has been thinking about something in everyday language, someone's been considering something.</p>
<p>Maybe they're thinking of taking a new job, for example, right?</p>
<p>Or it's something lighter, like where do you want to go for lunch?</p>
<p>I gave you some time to think about it.</p>
<p>And Michelle, what's a sample sentence then?</p>
<p>Yeah, so yeah, what's the verdict on lunch?</p>
<p>Are we getting Thai, right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>What was the outcome of the decision?</p>
<p>What did you decide?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And the key thing to know here, this is a real nuance, Michelle, but I feel like there needs to be a gap of time in which someone has been thinking about it, right?</p>
<p>Let's say I called you in the morning and we're both at work.</p>
<p>I say, hey, Michelle, you want to get lunch today?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And you say sure.</p>
<p>And then I say, can you think of where you want to go?</p>
<p>And when we meet up, we can decide.</p>
<p>So I gave you the choice, and I know that you're thinking about it.</p>
<p>And then when we come back together, I'm going to say to you, so Michelle, what's the verdict on lunch?</p>
<p>Verdict on lunch?</p>
<p>Right, Don't you think there needs to be... Yeah, well, there needs to be that time, and I guess...</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>There needs to be that time.</p>
<p>And I guess that comes, if you think about it, makes sense with the courtroom, right?</p>
<p>The verdict is after some deliberation amongst the jury.</p>
<p>So it's not, I wouldn't say to you, Lindsay, what do you want to do for lunch?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>And they say, what's the verdict?</p>
<p>That makes no sense.</p>
<p>And actually that's fun because that leads directly into our next one.</p>
<p>The jury's still out.</p>
<p>So the jury's out, right?</p>
<p>Deciding where you want to go for lunch.</p>
<p>We're just doing these fun little analogies here.</p>
<p>So with the verdict piece, someone needs to have been thinking about something.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>So I wouldn't just say, hey, what do you want to do tonight?</p>
<p>What's the verdict?</p>
<p>No, that doesn't really work, right?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>There needs to be time.</p>
<p>So with the jury still being out, the jury hasn't decided yet.</p>
<p>There's no decision yet.</p>
<p>So you could say the jury's out or you could even say the jury's still out.</p>
<p>Either one.</p>
<p>But what's an example with that?</p>
<p>Okay, you could say the jury's still out as to whether or not school will be closed for snow tomorrow.</p>
<p>And I don't know.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>No tomorrow.</p>
<p>And I don't know what your thoughts are on kind of belaboring an analogy, but I probably wouldn't continue with that same line.</p>
<p>Like if I asked you, what's the verdict on lunch?</p>
<p>And you probably wouldn't say, oh, I don't know, the jury's still out.</p>
<p>You probably wouldn't say that, right?</p>
<p>That's too much, right?</p>
<p>I mean, unless I was trying to be super, you know, I don't know, humorous or whatever.</p>
<p>But no, I wouldn't. No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It doesn't mean we have to continue with these same, I guess it's kind of analogies in a sense.</p>
<p>What's the word I'm looking for?</p>
<p>Metaphors or I'm not sure, but it's too much.</p>
<p>It just gets a little overwhelming.</p>
<p>Yeah, Snow days, Lindsay.</p>
<p>Do you remember being a kid and just like looking at the bottom of the TV to see if your school was closed or if the jury was still out?</p>
<p>Yeah, And I remember there was a number we could call either TV downstairs or a number and I had memorized, you know, your school administrative unit district, right?</p>
<p>And then you're waiting for that SAU 29.</p>
<p>Come on, say it.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>at SAU 29.</p>
<p>Come on, say it, say it.</p>
<p>Yep, yep, yep, exactly.</p>
<p>So a lot of, jury was still out.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>Yeah, so funny.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Okay, so now, Michelle, we have another great one, super relevant in everyday life and culture.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>This is to plead the fifth.</p>
<p>Yes, Now, yeah, let's get into the amendments a little bit.</p>
<p>Lindsay, what is this about?</p>
<p>Okay, this is talking about the Fifth Amendment in the Constitution, the amendment of not having to self-incriminate.</p>
<p>So you don't have to say anything.</p>
<p>If lawyers ask you questions or the DA, the district attorney is asking you questions, you can plead the fifth.</p>
<p>And we see this a lot on crime shows.</p>
<p>And also when people first get arrested, they're read their, what do they call them, the Miranda rights.</p>
<p>And I think the Fifth Amendment is probably one of them.</p>
<p>I'm guessing.</p>
<p>I'm guessing.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>But yeah, and whenever somebody says plead the fifth, you get this feeling of it's guilty.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Maybe it's not true.</p>
<p>But at least in fun language, that's how it's used.</p>
<p>Right, If you're kind of guilty of something.</p>
<p>So let's do this little role play.</p>
<p>Yeah, let's take this back to a normal situation at home, right?</p>
<p>Hey, did you eat the last cookie?</p>
<p>I plead the fifth.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we're not in a courtroom here.</p>
<p>Right, we're not being arrested.</p>
<p>It's more like, oh, yeah, I probably did, but I'm just being playful and I'm not going to admit that I did.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>I'm saying I did.</p>
<p>Essentially, yeah.</p>
<p>You're saying you did.</p>
<p>Okay, that's an important piece.</p>
<p>Case closed, Michelle.</p>
<p>Case closed.</p>
<p>Yeah, this means the case has ended.</p>
<p>The judge is moving on to the next one.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is fun.</p>
<p>This episode is fun.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>Yeah, this is fun.</p>
<p>This episode is fun.</p>
<p>So essentially outside of the courtroom, which is where we all exist, it means this is over or this has been resolved.</p>
<p>We're no longer talking about this thing, right?</p>
<p>Maybe you've been debating this for a while.</p>
<p>And this could be used in more serious arguments between spouses maybe, right?</p>
<p>Like you want to live in the city and maybe he wants to live in the countryside and you've been debating for years.</p>
<p>And then finally you decide, okay, case closed.</p>
<p>We've decided this, right?</p>
<p>Yep, exactly.</p>
<p>Or it could be used in a much lighter way, like this is the best ice cream ever, case closed.</p>
<p>Nice, I like that.</p>
<p>So you can see the range for that one is pretty wide in terms of scenarios.</p>
<p>Yeah, very much so.</p>
<p>Lindsay, which of these do you like the most?</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, I really like, I like the jury still out.</p>
<p>I think that's kind of fun.</p>
<p>The jury's still out because it means a decision is still being made about something.</p>
<p>And often that's the place we live where we hang out in the world is we're ruminating over something.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>We're ruminating over something or we're thinking about something, you know, and taking our time.</p>
<p>So the jury's still out.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So let's get into our poll for today, guys.</p>
<p>Again, you're going to see this on Spotify.</p>
<p>So the question is, do you like to watch courtroom shows?</p>
<p>Yes or no?</p>
<p>So we want to know who's into those kinds of shows.</p>
<p>Yes, And if you're listening in YouTube, Michelle, let's throw this out there.</p>
<p>If you are watching today in YouTube, you can answer this too.</p>
<p>Answer the poll in the comments, but tell us what is your favorite.</p>
<p>So answer yes or no.</p>
<p>But then if it's yes, you have a place to make a comment.</p>
<p>So tell us what is your favorite courtroom drama.</p>
<p>We're looking for recommendations.</p>
<p>Right, Michelle?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Let's do a role play, Lindsay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So here we are friends and we're trying to figure out who forgot to pay their dinner bill on Venmo after a group dinner.</p>
<p>So again, we're going to use these expressions.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>We're going to use these expressions, but as Lindsay mentioned earlier, you probably wouldn't use them all like this.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah.</p>
<p>You wouldn't belabor that too much, right?</p>
<p>It just gets a little tacky.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's a little much.</p>
<p>Unless you're having fun.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So you paid?</p>
<p>Yeah, Okay.</p>
<p>So the jury's still out as to who didn't Venmo you yet?</p>
<p>Yeah, I have to look through.</p>
<p>Who ordered the giant cake?</p>
<p>Oh, I plead the fifth, but I paid for it.</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>And what's the verdict on the restaurant for next week?</p>
<p>Undecided.</p>
<p>Just because I hope whoever it is pays me back by then.</p>
<p>Oh, wait.</p>
<p>I just got an alert.</p>
<p>Jared just paid.</p>
<p>All good now.</p>
<p>Oh, good.</p>
<p>Case closed.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>We're going to investigate Jared if he doesn't pay.</p>
<p>Yes, All right.</p>
<p>So here we have a bunch of idioms, fun idioms.</p>
<p>And first you said, so you paid?</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>I said, who, so you paid?</p>
<p>Clearly you're looking to figure out who needs to pay.</p>
<p>And then I said, okay, so the jury's still out as to who didn't Venmo yet, right?</p>
<p>Right, so we don't know who it was, right?</p>
<p>And just to pay attention to the grammar here, the jury's still out as to something, right?</p>
<p>So I want our listeners to pay attention to that.</p>
<p>We need the grammar to make this work, right?</p>
<p>The jury is still out as to something.</p>
<p>And again, this is a little bit different because it's not like, oh, the decision being made, right?</p>
<p>The jury being out, but it's still, I think it's just used also in terms of something is still a mystery.</p>
<p>Yeah, we're figuring something out.</p>
<p>Yeah, you're figuring something out.</p>
<p>There's a mystery.</p>
<p>You've got to do some research maybe.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>Then what?</p>
<p>I said, who ordered the giant cake?</p>
<p>And it was me, and I'm admitting it here, right?</p>
<p>As we said, ooh, I plead the fifth, but I paid for it.</p>
<p>And it's funny because by saying I plead the fifth, you're saying I ordered the...</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p>You're saying I did it.</p>
<p>Yeah, Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>Cause I didn't even ask you specifically, but you just, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It's so funny.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And I said, and what's the verdict on the restaurant for next week?</p>
<p>So sounds like we do kind of a, maybe a weekly dinner or we just know that.</p>
<p>Yeah, And we're deciding.</p>
<p>So I'm saying what's the decision.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>What's the verdict?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>And then we went down to the bottom and you said, oh, Jared just paid all good now.</p>
<p>And then I say, oh good.</p>
<p>Case closed.</p>
<p>Yeah, So that just means we figured it out.</p>
<p>We're moving on.</p>
<p>That issue is all set.</p>
<p>Yeah, Good.</p>
<p>Fun episode today, Michelle, especially because these actually, you know, we're not just making this up here, guys.</p>
<p>Like these, we genuinely do use these expressions in everyday life.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, That's why I, that's where I got the idea because I said, I said one of these in real life.</p>
<p>So, and then I was like, oh, I love it.</p>
<p>They're fun.</p>
<p>Anyway, guys, check out episode 2382, drive safe or drive safely, when to use</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p>or drive safely, when to use flat adverbs in English.</p>
<p>Interesting, love it.</p>
<p>And what's our takeaway?</p>
<p>Where should we leave our listeners?</p>
<p>These are just fun.</p>
<p>They're used, as you can see, they're very versatile because they can be used in more serious situations or more lighthearted, humorous situations like, where's the ice cream?</p>
<p>Oh, I plead the fifth.</p>
<p>So, you know, just listen for these.</p>
<p>Don't use them all at once.</p>
<p>Give them a try and yeah, let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>You will definitely hear these around.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>And guys, don't forget to leave us a review wherever you listen, whether it's Spotify or Apple Podcasts or YouTube.</p>
<p>You could write a comment or in the app.</p>
