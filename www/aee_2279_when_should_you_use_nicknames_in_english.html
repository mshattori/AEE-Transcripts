<p id="p-6">Do you go by a nickname?</p>
<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p id="p-7">Do you go by a nickname? Today, we answer a listener question about how to navigate this complicated cultural topic in English.</p>
<p id="p-8">Listen in today.</p>
<p id="p-9">Hey, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-10">How are you? I'm great.</p>
<p id="p-11">How are you, Lindsay? Great.</p>
<p id="p-12">Aubrey, do you have a nickname that you go by? You know, growing up, my family called me Aub, just Aub, but I never, I rarely tell anybody, like, call me Aub.</p>
<p id="p-13">It was like a very familiar, you know, my brothers and sisters would call me Aub, just kind of for short, because Aubrey is not really, some people who are named Aubrey go by Bree, like sometimes there's a, but it's not a super, it's not a name that like, oh, everybody who has this name goes by a nickname, right? Right, For sure.</p>
<p id="p-14">For sure.</p>
<p id="p-15">What about you? It's one of those.</p>
<p id="p-16">It's the same.</p>
<p id="p-17">People call you Linz.</p>
<p id="p-18">A lot of people call me Linz.</p>
<p id="p-19">Well, a lot of people that are close to me call me Linz.</p>
<p id="p-20">So my dad, my partner sometimes, close friends, but sometimes someone that I don't know.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-21">But, sometimes, someone that I'm not as close to will call my lens and it kind of pushes me back and I go, �Whoa, that's weird.� Yes, That's what we're talking about today because that does happen where someone will be sort of more familiar than you're expecting or ready for, and it does kind of throw you off.</p>
<p id="p-22">And this is so cultural.</p>
<p id="p-23">Like sometimes if it's someone who's from another part of the country, another part of the States, or another country, then for them it's very different, you know, how formal to be or how informal with nicknames.</p>
<p id="p-24">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-25">This is a great topic today.</p>
<p id="p-26">I'm so excited.</p>
<p id="p-27">So, we're going to start off with a question from Mauro.</p>
<p id="p-28">Is that right? Yes, Mauro from Brazil, I believe, or from France.</p>
<p id="p-29">Yes, Originally from France, living in Brazil, which will matter later because he gave us some interesting cultural insight about this.</p>
<p id="p-30">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-31">I'm excited to hear from him.</p>
<p id="p-32">So, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-33">He says, �Hi, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-34">What's shaking?� So, he's picking up on our greeting that we have.</p>
<p id="p-35">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-36">You can tell he listens to the podcast.</p>
<p id="p-37">I'd like to commend you, commend Aller's English for this stellar podcast.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-38">Allers English for this stellar podcast.</p>
<p id="p-39">Great episode on Shout Out.</p>
<p id="p-40">Well, thank you, Mauro.</p>
<p id="p-41">That is fantastic.</p>
<p id="p-42">We love that you love the show.</p>
<p id="p-43">All right, he says, I have a question for you.</p>
<p id="p-44">Do you guys have nicknames between yourselves? Would it be impolite to call Jessica Jess if I met her for the first time, for example? Thanks.</p>
<p id="p-45">All right.</p>
<p id="p-46">It's a good question.</p>
<p id="p-47">I mean, the truth is our listeners might know us better than some people in our lives.</p>
<p id="p-48">I know this is it does make it different when you're listening to a podcast.</p>
<p id="p-49">You know, you start feeling like you know someone.</p>
<p id="p-50">We're sharing so many details about our personal lives.</p>
<p id="p-51">If you listen to ALTS Energy, you might hear me call Jess sometimes because we've become friends.</p>
<p id="p-52">I know her so well.</p>
<p id="p-53">And Jessica shortens really easily to Jess, right? Right, right, right.</p>
<p id="p-54">But it's true if and part of what I answered Mauro right away was, you know, someone you haven't met before, even if you've heard them a lot on a podcast, you would still want to use their full name until they tell you.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-55">full name until they tell you, like, call me Jess, at least in the United States.</p>
<p id="p-56">Wouldn't you agree, Lindsay? I 100% agree, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-57">It's about getting permission, in a sense, because it is a pretty intimate thing, especially in the U.S.</p>
<p id="p-58">I think you're 100% right.</p>
<p id="p-59">Guys, go ahead and hit that follow button right now so that you don't miss any other episodes of All Ears English, right? We've got some really good stuff coming out this fall, so hit follow.</p>
<p id="p-60">All right.</p>
<p id="p-61">So let's dive in.</p>
<p id="p-62">We're going to share three things you should think about when deciding whether to use someone's nickname.</p>
<p id="p-63">And first here is the relationship, right? And this is where it's a little tricky.</p>
<p id="p-64">You may feel like you are close with someone, you have a relationship if you've listened to them on a podcast for years.</p>
<p id="p-65">But really, you have to think about that's one way, right? Unfortunately, we don't have that relationship yet with you.</p>
<p id="p-66">Unless you come to open conversation club, then maybe we're getting to know you and we'll start using nicknames.</p>
<p id="p-67">But you have to know someone well enough that you're familiar in order to start using a nickname.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-68">earlier, in order to start using a nickname.</p>
<p id="p-69">Yeah, I would say so.</p>
<p id="p-70">For sure.</p>
<p id="p-71">So considering the relationship, that is the number one thing to keep in mind.</p>
<p id="p-72">And definitely this varies across cultures.</p>
<p id="p-73">So what would we say then, Aubrey, what is some language here that we need? So for example, if you were to meet Jessica for the first time, even if you've heard me call her Jess a bunch of times, you would still say, Jessica, so nice to meet you.</p>
<p id="p-74">And then if she said, call me Jess, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-75">The next time you chatted, you could call her Jess, right? This is big, where a lot of people go by a nickname all the time.</p>
<p id="p-76">My daughter's name is Georgia.</p>
<p id="p-77">She goes by Gigi.</p>
<p id="p-78">And that's the first thing she'll say to you.</p>
<p id="p-79">If you call her Georgia, she'll say, call me Gigi.</p>
<p id="p-80">And that's different, right? Even if you don't have this very close relationship, a lot of people use a nickname more than their name, but they will tell you that.</p>
<p id="p-81">Right, As you said earlier, some names shorten a lot better and more commonly, right? Jennifer Jen, Jessica Jess.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-82">Jessica, Jess, whereas my name, it's less likely to be shortened, right? Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-83">Not as commonly, not as easily.</p>
<p id="p-84">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-85">So it's not always, if they do say, call me this, call me that, it's not necessarily saying that it's the right closeness.</p>
<p id="p-86">It could just be, okay, it's easier to say this.</p>
<p id="p-87">Right, That's the second thing we're talking about is the actual name and what the person wants to be called.</p>
<p id="p-88">So Mauro actually pointed out, we exchanged a couple of emails and he was saying, clearly there are a lot of names that are more prone to nicknames.</p>
<p id="p-89">Like Michael will often go by Mike.</p>
<p id="p-90">Oh my gosh, yes.</p>
<p id="p-91">William often goes by Bill.</p>
<p id="p-92">There are a lot of names that really, it's very common for them to use a certain nickname.</p>
<p id="p-93">But like you said, Lindsay, Aubrey, it's not as obvious what the nickname would be.</p>
<p id="p-94">Right, Or Jonathan is rarely Jonathan.</p>
<p id="p-95">It's 99% of the time, it's John.</p>
<p id="p-96">Christopher, Chris, they often will shorten a lot of those names.</p>
<p id="p-97">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-98">A lot of guys' names, I think.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-99">Yeah, a lot of guys' names, I think, are maybe more likely to be nicknamed.</p>
<p id="p-100">Not sure.</p>
<p id="p-101">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-102">And they're interesting how some names, like Elizabeth is a good example.</p>
<p id="p-103">There are so many options for nicknames.</p>
<p id="p-104">They might go by, my sister's name is Elizabeth.</p>
<p id="p-105">She goes by Liz to most everyone she knows, but us, her family, siblings, called her Lizzie.</p>
<p id="p-106">But then some people who are named Elizabeth will go by Beth or Betty or something else.</p>
<p id="p-107">So you can't always assume what the nickname will be.</p>
<p id="p-108">So that's another reason to wait and find out what they ask you to call them or listen to hear what other close friends are calling them.</p>
<p id="p-109">That will make a difference, what the name is and what someone has chosen to be called.</p>
<p id="p-110">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-111">There's a lot here.</p>
<p id="p-112">There's a lot of context, a lot of culture, a lot that we have to know.</p>
<p id="p-113">And then that is number three, Aubrey, culture.</p>
<p id="p-114">What do we have to know about culture? How could our advice be a little different in different places? Exactly right.</p>
<p id="p-115">And number one and two that we gave you, you know, relationships and what name.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-116">know, relationships and what names they might go by will be different depending on the country and even within the country.</p>
<p id="p-117">This might be different on the East Coast or in the South than what I'm used to, right? So wherever you're living, you'll need to take that into account.</p>
<p id="p-118">And this was interesting.</p>
<p id="p-119">Mauro let me know, I asked, you know, what is this like where you live? Do people use nicknames? Would they call someone by a nickname even if they're meeting them for the first time? And he said, here in Brazil, we have a tendency to be more casual.</p>
<p id="p-120">So for example, I may be introduced to a friend of a friend straight with their nickname.</p>
<p id="p-121">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-122">And then he said, I even have a boss.</p>
<p id="p-123">I call him by his nickname.</p>
<p id="p-124">And then he said, but that's because we used to work at the same level.</p>
<p id="p-125">So they already have this relationship.</p>
<p id="p-126">So that's interesting.</p>
<p id="p-127">But then he says, on the other hand, part of my family lives in France, and it's unthinkable to use nicknames there unless there's a lot of intimacy.</p>
<p id="p-128">So you can see that's even more extreme than the US.</p>
<p id="p-129">Like it would be offensive to call someone a nickname unless you know them very well.</p>
<p id="p-130">Wow.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-131">them very well.</p>
<p id="p-132">Wow.</p>
<p id="p-133">Unthinkable is a very strong word, isn't it? So clearly, we know this now.</p>
<p id="p-134">When we go to France, we'll be careful.</p>
<p id="p-135">Good to know.</p>
<p id="p-136">Good to know.</p>
<p id="p-137">A little vocab note here in that message, Mauro had asked, he said, I call him by his nickname.</p>
<p id="p-138">And then he wanted to know if that phrase is correct.</p>
<p id="p-139">And it's interesting because that's very formal to say, I call you by your name.</p>
<p id="p-140">I call you by your nickname.</p>
<p id="p-141">Instead, we'll usually say they go by.</p>
<p id="p-142">He goes by Mike.</p>
<p id="p-143">She goes by this.</p>
<p id="p-144">Maybe you would say, I call him Mike, or I use his nickname Mike.</p>
<p id="p-145">But this phrasal verb, go by, I think we use the most often in the US.</p>
<p id="p-146">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-147">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-148">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-149">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-150">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-151">This is good stuff.</p>
<p id="p-152">There's one side point that comes to mind here, Aubrey, and it's around kind of appropriateness of certain nicknames as you get older into the business world, right? I think especially with guys' nicknames, you take something like you have the name Thomas, right? Shortened to Tom.</p>
<p id="p-153">But when you're a kid in the US, it might be Tommy.</p>
<p id="p-154">Tommy.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-155">it might be Tommy Tommy, but I know a couple of guys who have taken Tommy into their working world and it makes me roll my eyes a little bit and I think it sounds a little childish.</p>
<p id="p-156">So thinking about as you become a professional, obviously, like the more straightforward nicknames, I think, you know, Jess, Jessica makes sense.</p>
<p id="p-157">Jen, Jennifer, that makes sense.</p>
<p id="p-158">But maybe like a Jenny, right? Maybe a little Susie, juvenile, like Susan who went by Susie as a child.</p>
<p id="p-159">So yeah, this happens for men and women.</p>
<p id="p-160">It's interesting to think about do you keep that childhood nickname or do you once you're, you know, working, do you go with the longer, more formal version? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-161">And I also think there's a gender element here too, because I think men are more likely to get away with that, taking the boy nickname and getting away with it in the working world than women, right? At least in the US, right? We could do here, Aubrey, but maybe we'll dive into that side of things another day.</p>
<p id="p-162">So we're going to take a quick</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-163">another day.</p>
<p id="p-164">So we're going to take a quick break and come back with a role play.</p>
<p id="p-165">All right, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-166">So here we are talking about new hires at our company.</p>
<p id="p-167">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-168">I'll start us out.</p>
<p id="p-169">Have you met Michael Adams? He was hired last week.</p>
<p id="p-170">Yes, He said he goes by Mike.</p>
<p id="p-171">Oh, good to know.</p>
<p id="p-172">What about Vicky? Did you meet her? Is that Victoria? Yes, I guess she goes by Vicky.</p>
<p id="p-173">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-174">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-175">And as I was writing out this role play, I had put in a couple of those other options, and then they just sounded so off to me, so formal.</p>
<p id="p-176">I think I almost always say go by.</p>
<p id="p-177">She goes by Vicky.</p>
<p id="p-178">She goes by Mike.</p>
<p id="p-179">Do you use any of these other options, Lindsay? No, I think goes by is perfect.</p>
<p id="p-180">That's why I'm glad we're doing this role play because we are forced to think about it in a real English way.</p>
<p id="p-181">And this is what we're giving you guys today.</p>
<p id="p-182">I think I originally had, she uses the nickname Vicky.</p>
<p id="p-183">I'm like, oh, that sounds so strange.</p>
<p id="p-184">She goes by Vicky.</p>
<p id="p-185">Yes, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-186">All right.</p>
<p id="p-187">So there it is, right? So go.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-188">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-189">All right.</p>
<p id="p-190">So there it is, right? So goes by is if you take away anything today, take away that.</p>
<p id="p-191">He goes by X, he goes by Y, and maybe go for Mike, not Mikey.</p>
<p id="p-192">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-193">Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-194">Tom, not Tommy.</p>
<p id="p-195">If you're a professional.</p>
<p id="p-196">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-197">There's one other interesting thing that came up in this role play, I thought, was that if you have met someone like, you know, a new coworker, just like in this role play, and they have told you, oh, call me Mike, I feel like this is such a considerate, such a thoughtful thing to do to share that with another coworker, if they say, oh, have you met Michael? Oh, he said he likes to go by Mike.</p>
<p id="p-198">And then here's the question, Lindsay, would you then, when you go and meet Mike, do you think you would still call him Michael until he tells you call me Mike? It's a good question, right? There could be some moments of awkwardness here, right? Especially on the part of, in my case, if I were in that position, feels awkward, I probably would still go with Michael until he corrected me personally.</p>
<p id="p-199">I think I was too.</p>
<p id="p-200">Maybe I would say like, oh,</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-201">too.</p>
<p id="p-202">Maybe I would say like, oh, Lindsay told me you go by Mike and let him correct me or not, right? Instead of just calling him Mike like we're old friends.</p>
<p id="p-203">I actually like your idea, Aubrey, because that creates a connection moment.</p>
<p id="p-204">Maybe it goes into when I was a kid, they called me this and then they call, oh, where'd you grow up? And now you're building a relationship.</p>
<p id="p-205">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-206">Good point.</p>
<p id="p-207">Yes, Right, Whenever we have a chance to bond about something from childhood or something personal about this, especially with coworkers where those occasions are a little more few and far between, that's definitely going to help us connect.</p>
<p id="p-208">What a good episode today and such a rare topic, but I'm so happy that our listener, Mauro, asked it.</p>
