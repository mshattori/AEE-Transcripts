<p id="p-19">Hello, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-20">How's it going today? How are you feeling? I'm great.</p>
<p id="p-21">Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-22">How are you? I'm feeling good.</p>
<p id="p-23">Hey, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-24">Has anything strange happened to you lately? Hm.</p>
<p id="p-25">Yeah, the other night I woke up in the middle of the night because I heard someone come in.</p>
<p id="p-26">It was like 4 a.m.</p>
<p id="p-27">and usually we're all like, asleep.</p>
<p id="p-28">No one's usually getting home at 4 a.m.</p>
<p id="p-29">and I heard the door open.</p>
<p id="p-30">Someone come in.</p>
<p id="p-31">So that was strange.</p>
<p id="p-32">It was my daughter.</p>
<p id="p-33">She totally broke curfew and came home late 4 a.m.</p>
<p id="p-34">She's 18 now.</p>
<p id="p-35">So it's a little tricky.</p>
<p id="p-36">It's like, should she have a curfew? I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-37">Wow.</p>
<p id="p-38">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-39">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-40">If my door opened at 4 a.m.</p>
<p id="p-41">I'd be freaking out.</p>
<p id="p-42">Is there a burglar? What's going on? Exactly.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-43">Burglar, what's going on? Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-44">Right, Panicked.</p>
<p id="p-45">OK, So that happened to you.</p>
<p id="p-46">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-47">So we are starting today's episode with a great question, right? You asked something strange that happened to me lately and we got a great question about happened to versus happen with.</p>
<p id="p-48">Can you read that one? This is from Mateos from Brazil.</p>
<p id="p-49">So Mateo says, hey, there, I have a question for you.</p>
<p id="p-50">When do I use happen two versus happen with? I love the show and I've been listening since 2020.</p>
<p id="p-51">Amazing.</p>
<p id="p-52">Yes, I love that.</p>
<p id="p-53">I've been listening for four years long, long time and such a great question because this is a little tricky, right? They are definitely different and this is one of those that's bringing you to that 99% when you know the difference and can use these correctly.</p>
<p id="p-54">And I also think this is going to be very important because there are a lot of mist translations where people will translate, especially from Spanish, maybe French.</p>
<p id="p-55">I remember.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-56">Maybe French, I remember hearing that from Spanish speakers when I traveled around South America, incorrectly translating it, right? When it comes to prepositions like that, they work differently in other languages.</p>
<p id="p-57">So if you're trying to translate directly, you're often going to use the wrong preposition.</p>
<p id="p-58">So we are going to dive into each of them, give you lots of examples.</p>
<p id="p-59">So you know which one to use when that's why we're doing a series, right, Aubrey about our series here and what our listeners should do to make sure they don't miss a single part of this series.</p>
<p id="p-60">Yes, there's a lot with happen as I started planning this.</p>
<p id="p-61">So we're going to do part two on Business English because there are phrases with happen that are perfect to show understanding after an apology, like happens to the best of us, accidents happen, but you sort of have to be careful about not minimizing something that's bigger, especially at work.</p>
<p id="p-62">So follow this English to get part two, that's going to be a good one.</p>
<p id="p-63">I'm excited for that one.</p>
<p id="p-64">Sounds interesting.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-65">That one sounds interesting.</p>
<p id="p-66">And then part three will be over on Ielts Energy, right? Guys, if you don't know, we have our third podcast, the I E L T Ss Energy podcast where Auburn and Jessica will show you how to improve your pronunciation and to not be monotone which really tanks your score, doesn't it? And there's a phrase, what happens? That's perfect to say it just so happens.</p>
<p id="p-67">So whether you're studying for Ielts or not, go and check out, make sure you're following Ielts energy so you can get this really fun breakdown of that phrase.</p>
<p id="p-68">Excellent.</p>
<p id="p-69">So guys, open your search bar now find business English hit, follow then find Ielts energy hit.</p>
<p id="p-70">Follow.</p>
<p id="p-71">So you'll be ready for parts two and three.</p>
<p id="p-72">Awesome.</p>
<p id="p-73">Yes, OK, Let's dive in.</p>
<p id="p-74">We're first going to talk about happen to Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-75">When do we use, happen to? OK, So this is when things happen to like they occur to a specific person, a group or a thing.</p>
<p id="p-76">OK, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-77">So for example, what happened to your sister? I saw her crying, right?</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-78">I saw her crying, right? This means some kind of specific action or event happened to her or what happened to you.</p>
<p id="p-79">Maybe you didn't show up, right.</p>
<p id="p-80">That could be, that could be true too.</p>
<p id="p-81">Right? You don't show up at a meeting or something.</p>
<p id="p-82">What happened to you? Did something happen? Did something go wrong? Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-83">This is often our question.</p>
<p id="p-84">If it's general, we don't know why someone was late or something, something's happened, we should be like what happened to you and then they're going to give the details there, whether it's that they were late or whatever happened.</p>
<p id="p-85">And this is where I've seen the, this is quite subtle today.</p>
<p id="p-86">The difference here.</p>
<p id="p-87">Um This is where I've seen the mistranslation among specifically Spanish speakers.</p>
<p id="p-88">For example, if I'm looking sad, I've heard someone say to me what happened with you, right? And what they should have said was what happened to you, I think.</p>
<p id="p-89">Um but it's such a subtle, it's almost not even a mistake, right? Because it's so subtle, it is subtle and we're going to dive into this</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-90">Is subtle and we're going to dive into this with happen with a little more.</p>
<p id="p-91">But I've also heard someone say what's happening with you when, what they mean is what happened to you.</p>
<p id="p-92">And there's some nuance here.</p>
<p id="p-93">If you say what's happening with you, there's almost some judgment that there's something wrong with your behavior, wouldn't you? Yes, but it's happening with you broadly.</p>
<p id="p-94">The broad strokes of today's episode are happened to tend to be about a person, right? A group or a thing.</p>
<p id="p-95">Is that right? And then when we move to happen with is more about an event, a situation.</p>
<p id="p-96">Is that right? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-97">Happened with is more, more general, more overarching some kind of situation or event.</p>
<p id="p-98">So if you ask someone what's happening with you, you're asking about their overall situation or event.</p>
<p id="p-99">And it's sort of implying that something has gone really wrong.</p>
<p id="p-100">So we have to be careful because we might ask that and accidentally imply something we don't mean to, oh my gosh, this is extremely high level today because if I</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-101">High level today because if I think about saying what's happening to you, it's also kind of searing because it seems like there's something going wrong with the person they're getting sick or something's going on.</p>
<p id="p-102">So well, let's dig in to happen with and maybe we can kind of pull out the differences here.</p>
<p id="p-103">So just one last quick note about happened two and this is very related to both of them, right? It is like you said, it's sort of less, it's sort of more trivial things that are not such a big deal.</p>
<p id="p-104">This has happened to me.</p>
<p id="p-105">I got to tell you what happened to my phone and I'm just going to share, maybe I dropped it on a rock, right? Whereas now that we're going to happen with, it's a little heavier because it's about bigger things.</p>
<p id="p-106">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-107">We're going into bigger things then.</p>
<p id="p-108">All right.</p>
<p id="p-109">So referring to a situation or an event and something big, for example, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-110">Yeah, I might say what happened with Olympic Gymnastics yesterday.</p>
<p id="p-111">Maybe I've heard some buzz, right? I saw some pictures, someone was injured, something</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-112">Or someone was injured, something pretty big.</p>
<p id="p-113">If I'm saying like, what happened with that yesterday? There's some kind of big event or situation that clearly happened.</p>
<p id="p-114">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-115">Or if your local coffee shop closes so sad.</p>
<p id="p-116">I hope it doesn't happen to you.</p>
<p id="p-117">Right, Uh Do you know what happened with the coffee shop on the corner? I saw that it closed.</p>
<p id="p-118">Yes, And when you're asking this, right, you're sort of asking, do you know the overall situation? I'm not asking about like one specific event that happened, like what happened to that company would be so much more would be strange to ask someone who probably also doesn't know much about it.</p>
<p id="p-119">So instead we use this sort of overarching general, what happened with that? Why did they close? Ok.</p>
<p id="p-120">So broad, right.</p>
<p id="p-121">More overarching.</p>
<p id="p-122">I like that.</p>
<p id="p-123">What else do we need to know here? So when it comes to asking about a person, we might say what happened with so and so what's happening with a person, but in that case, we are asking about an event or situation they're dealing with.</p>
<p id="p-124">And so that's where</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-125">With.</p>
<p id="p-126">And so that's where we might accidentally imply that someone's dealing with a big situation or event if we say what's happening with you.</p>
<p id="p-127">But we might say like, what happened with your boyfriend, if we have some reason to believe that they're going through some kind of big situation.</p>
<p id="p-128">Wow.</p>
<p id="p-129">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-130">This is extremely subtle.</p>
<p id="p-131">All right, we'll take a quick break and then we'll come back.</p>
<p id="p-132">We'll look at the difference in some role plays guys.</p>
<p id="p-133">All right.</p>
<p id="p-134">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-135">Aubrey, let's dive into some role plays and see if we can continue to really find those differences here.</p>
<p id="p-136">So perfect.</p>
<p id="p-137">So you and I are high school classmates in this role play.</p>
<p id="p-138">I have turned back time.</p>
<p id="p-139">Lindsay, we're quite young in this role play five years back.</p>
<p id="p-140">Right, Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-141">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-142">Yeah, I'm, I'm ready.</p>
<p id="p-143">Did you hear what happened to Josh? No.</p>
<p id="p-144">What happened? I guess he got cheating.</p>
<p id="p-145">Got caught cheating on the exam.</p>
<p id="p-146">I don't know what's happening with him.</p>
<p id="p-147">That doesn't seem like him.</p>
<p id="p-148">Oh, wow.</p>
<p id="p-149">That's crazy.</p>
<p id="p-150">Well, maybe he didn't actually do it though.</p>
<p id="p-151">You know what happened to me once</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-152">Oh, you know what happened to me once I was accused of cheating when I didn't.</p>
<p id="p-153">Oh, no.</p>
<p id="p-154">What is happening with teachers? That would be awful to be accused of something you didn't do? Ok.</p>
<p id="p-155">So let's really dive into this here for our listeners to clear up any confusion.</p>
<p id="p-156">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-157">Yeah, we can show you why we used each one.</p>
<p id="p-158">So first I said, did you hear what happened to Josh? And I am talking about a very specific something that happened to him, right.</p>
<p id="p-159">I'm not asking about this sort of overall event or situation that he might be dealing with right here.</p>
<p id="p-160">I'm talking about a specific instance and it's also a feeling what happened to John.</p>
<p id="p-161">Gosh, it feels like something was done to him.</p>
<p id="p-162">That's right.</p>
<p id="p-163">I think that's one of the key differences.</p>
<p id="p-164">What happened to you, something happened, something occurred and was done kind of like against him almost.</p>
<p id="p-165">That's true because I wouldn't say, did you hear what happened to Josh? He dropped his cell phone? No, that didn't happen to him.</p>
<p id="p-166">That's something he did.</p>
<p id="p-167">What happened? I think you're exactly right.</p>
<p id="p-168">We say happened to when something was sort of done to him.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-169">When something was sort of done to him.</p>
<p id="p-170">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-171">So maybe that's another guideline that we want to make sure our listeners know, is it more passive or is it more of an active thing going on? So let's check that out.</p>
<p id="p-172">Let's keep going.</p>
<p id="p-173">So I said, no, what happened? OK, So there, we don't have to worry about with her two.</p>
<p id="p-174">And there's a small thing to point out here.</p>
<p id="p-175">It sort of would be strange because it's repetitive if you said no, what happened to Josh, right? Because I've already said that we know who we're talking about.</p>
<p id="p-176">So we just say, oh, what happened? I suppose you could say no, what happened to him? That would be OK, You're using a pronoun there.</p>
<p id="p-177">So it's not repeating the name at least.</p>
<p id="p-178">So know what happened to him or know what happened.</p>
<p id="p-179">I think it's good to go by the rule of we're a little lazy sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-180">So we say as few words as we need to, as we can possibly, we might even just say no, what was right? And then let's get into it.</p>
<p id="p-181">So you said, I guess he was caught cheating on the exam.</p>
<p id="p-182">I don't know what's happening with him.</p>
<p id="p-183">That doesn't seem like him.</p>
<p id="p-184">Now you're talking about, maybe he's going through some.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-185">You're talking about, maybe he's going through some kind of change.</p>
<p id="p-186">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-187">I wouldn't say, I don't know what's happened to him because I'm not talking about a single instance, a single event here.</p>
<p id="p-188">Now I'm sort of talking about the situation in general.</p>
<p id="p-189">What's happening with him? Like what is his deal? What is his situation and why would he do something like that? And also going back to the theory of its something coming at us versus something we're creating, maybe that follows that same theory.</p>
<p id="p-190">I don't know what's happening with him.</p>
<p id="p-191">That makes me think he's playing a part in the change.</p>
<p id="p-192">Potentially.</p>
<p id="p-193">I'm saying if that's the case, like this was something that he chose to do.</p>
<p id="p-194">So I don't know what's happening with him.</p>
<p id="p-195">What's the situation? And then the next one shows the exact opposite.</p>
<p id="p-196">Right, You know what happened to me once I was accused of cheating when I actually didn't cheat.</p>
<p id="p-197">So that was something outside that happened to you almost like you were a victim of that.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-198">Of that? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-199">So you're sort of sharing, you have this in common, this happened to him similar to what happened to me.</p>
<p id="p-200">It was out of my control, it wasn't my fault.</p>
<p id="p-201">It was more of like an outside situation.</p>
<p id="p-202">Hm.</p>
<p id="p-203">I think that's a good differentiator right there, right? Who's in control, who's taking part in this change? Right, And the last one, Aubrey and I said, what is happening with teachers and this we do often where we're talking about a very general situation, whatever it is.</p>
<p id="p-204">So here, if I feel like you were accused wrongly and then our other friend was accused wrongly.</p>
<p id="p-205">Now I'm applying it to the whole in general, right? Uh What is happening with teachers accusing students of things they didn't do exactly.</p>
<p id="p-206">So that implies the teachers themselves are kind of playing a part in this change.</p>
<p id="p-207">They're starting to become more sinister or something, right? Versus what? Go ahead, go ahead.</p>
<p id="p-208">No, go ahead versus what.</p>
<p id="p-209">What if I said what is happening to teachers? Well, it feels different almost</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-210">Feels different.</p>
<p id="p-211">Almost like someone is going after the teachers.</p>
<p id="p-212">Yes, that would be very different because that maybe you're coming from thinking the administration is cracking down on teachers.</p>
<p id="p-213">So what is happening to teachers? What is being done to them to make them make these choices? Yeah, I feel like that's kind of the main difference is like something from the outside is coming to you versus you're playing a part in what's going on.</p>
<p id="p-214">Does that feel? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-215">No, I think you're exactly right.</p>
<p id="p-216">And I feel like this last the sentence in the roleplay here is how we use happening with the most when we're either trying to not give an excuse for someone show understanding, we're trying to show understanding for something that's going on and we'll be like, what is happening with people these days or what is happening with teenagers.</p>
<p id="p-217">We're having, we have the solidarity of like, I'm sort of blaming the situation in general and taking the blame off of a person totally.</p>
<p id="p-218">And then sometimes just for another example, it could be pretty interchangeable.</p>
<p id="p-219">Like, what's the difference right now, Aubrey? We know we're in a very</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-220">Right now, Aubrey, we know we're in a very heated political moment, very divide.</p>
<p id="p-221">We're becoming a very divided country.</p>
<p id="p-222">So if I said what's happening to our country versus what's happening with our country, you're kind of saying the same thing.</p>
<p id="p-223">Yes, And that's what really makes happen to and happen with tricky is that sometimes they do have quite a different meaning.</p>
<p id="p-224">One is taught more overarching about an event and sometimes they are a little more interchangeable because in both of those cases, you're, you're talking about the situation in general, but because you're not talking about a person and you're talking about something bigger in this case of the country, both work, right? What's happening to companies these days? What's happening with companies, what's happening with the country or to the country? They're all sort of overarching because we're not talking about an individual.</p>
<p id="p-225">But in a way we are talking about each person is creating the division.</p>
<p id="p-226">That's why the with also works, right? It's like we're the victims of the division and we're creating the division in a sense.</p>
<p id="p-227">So that's why the two and the with do work in that</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-228">And the with do work in that scenario.</p>
<p id="p-229">Super interesting though because if you do make it more specific to individuals, if you say like what's happening to Americans instead of what's happening with Americans, then it feels more accusatory.</p>
<p id="p-230">Like what are the Americans doing to ruin their country? Right? Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-231">How sort of the more broad you make it the more interchangeable they are.</p>
<p id="p-232">Oh, wow.</p>
<p id="p-233">I feel like we need a follow.</p>
<p id="p-234">Well, we do have a follow up coming in part three, part two.</p>
<p id="p-235">but we may have to revisit this again.</p>
<p id="p-236">We'll come back to it really big, interesting, subtle topic.</p>
<p id="p-237">Perfect for all as English listeners at their level operating.</p>
<p id="p-238">There's a lot here, right? These are both really useful chunks, whether you're telling stories are describing events and there is enough nuance here that you might be implying something you don't mean to if you use one, but sometimes they are interchangeable.</p>
<p id="p-239">So very tricky.</p>
<p id="p-240">Oh, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-241">So good, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-242">Thanks for bringing this challenging topic today to our listeners guys.</p>
