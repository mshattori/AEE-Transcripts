<p>Hello, Michelle.</p>
<p>How's it going today? Happy Saturday.</p>
<p>Uh Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Happy Saturday.</p>
<p>To you too.</p>
<p>I love these Saturday episodes, guys.</p>
<p>You probably you're going to the gym or you're relaxing.</p>
<p>You maybe you're on your way to a brunch.</p>
<p>Thank you for spending your Saturday with us.</p>
<p>I know it's not all a Saturday, but it's also a summer Saturday, which is the best kind of Saturday.</p>
<p>So I hope our listeners are out there enjoying life and taking all ears English along.</p>
<p>But Michelle, do you tend to get excited for your birthday? Tell me about it.</p>
<p>Yes and no, because, you know, my birthday is around uh the New Year, Uh So I always get, it's at the end of December and I always, it just kind of gets squished in with other holidays.</p>
<p>And so I, I don't know, I don't really think about it too much.</p>
<p>But, um, what about you? 100%? So this is a massive connection topic.</p>
<p>I, I have to say I have a pretty darn awesome birthday when I was a kid.</p>
<p>I didn't think it was so great because all the kids were on vacation.</p>
<p>We weren't in school.</p>
<p>So I didn't get the cupcakes and the singing from my classmates.</p>
<p>But as an adult, my birthday is August 3rd.</p>
<p>And you too.</p>
<p>Right, You had, you had on December 30th, December.</p>
<p>You're right between Christmas and New Year and the holidays and New Year's.</p>
<p>But, and this is a massive connection topic and it often tends for me, it tends to lead into like just last week I was getting my blood drawn for some blood tests and I connected with the lady drawing my blood because she is a Leo but a very early Leo, late July.</p>
<p>And she said, isn't it awesome when our birthday is, didn't you hate it when you were a kid? Because no one sang to you in school? But now isn't it amazing as an adult? And then we started talking about being Leos and it just blew up as this incredible connection moment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you know, blood's getting drawn and all these things are so funny.</p>
<p>Well, it's a good distraction.</p>
<p>A great, it's so, I am so excited for this summer series Michelle.</p>
<p>It sounds like this is what we're going to get into.</p>
<p>Yeah, we are here guys for this brand new summer series about birthdays and yeah, I remember last summer, Lindsay.</p>
<p>I texted you an entire month.</p>
<p>I remember that.</p>
<p>I was so proud of myself too.</p>
<p>I'm gonna text Lindsay and oh, I guess it's your birthday, isn't it? And then I was a month early.</p>
<p>So, but now I know it, but I appreciated the thought and I was like, just come back in a month.</p>
<p>You know, it's ok.</p>
<p>Your early early bird.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Well, you know, do you know anybody who has some people say, oh, it's my birthday month and they make a huge deal out of it.</p>
<p>It's their whole birthday month and it's a celebration.</p>
<p>Are you like that or do you know anyone who does that? I do know people that do that.</p>
<p>I wouldn't say that.</p>
<p>I mean, I just think because my birthday falls in August is just a great month in general.</p>
<p>It's a sandals beach month, barbecue, you know, it's just, it's just a great month.</p>
<p>So it doesn't have to be my birthday month.</p>
<p>I just enjoy it by August.</p>
<p>These are great months of the year, you know.</p>
<p>But, yeah, there are people who do that for sure.</p>
<p>And, you know, this is what we're getting into.</p>
<p>So let's let our listeners know about this summer series Michelle.</p>
<p>What are we doing in the next month or so? Well, we're talking all things birthdays.</p>
<p>I mean, you even mentioned, I don't know if we should give it away one of the topics that we're going to be covering.</p>
<p>But this is, I mean, guys, we have, we don't just have the All Ears English podcast.</p>
<p>We also have Business English and we have Ielts and we are going to do four part series about birthdays.</p>
<p>So part one is going to be here.</p>
<p>This is part one.</p>
<p>Hello, how are you? Part two? We're gonna head over to our Business English podcast guys if you are preparing uh for something in the business world, if you are working and you and you use English, if you're looking for a job, this Business English podcast is great, but don't think that this is an episode over there.</p>
<p>That's only for people who are in the business world.</p>
<p>Business English can help you with your regular English and your real life.</p>
<p>So definitely wait, we're going to be doing next week part two about birthdays over on the Business English podcast.</p>
<p>And then what happens Lindsay? Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Then we come back to Old English for the next episode in the series.</p>
<p>And again, these are all distinct and different episodes.</p>
<p>I gave a hint into two of the topics, right? Sharing a birthday and sharing a zodiac sign, talking about zodiac signs very common.</p>
<p>So the third episode in the series this month will be on back here on All E English.</p>
<p>So make sure you're hitting follow, you're following the show and then part four will be over with Aubrey and Jessica on the I L S Energy Podcast.</p>
<p>So you want to go over there now and hit follow there two guys, I wonder what they're going to do over there around this topic.</p>
<p>It's a mystery.</p>
<p>It is a, it is a mystery.</p>
<p>They, they've told me some of their ideas.</p>
<p>So, um but definitely guys, two guys ready for this series, you got hit follow on Allers English business, English and Ielts so that you don't miss any of them and it just slips through the cracks and then, oh no, where did it go? Right, Don't forget about it guys.</p>
<p>This is good stuff.</p>
<p>Even if you're not in the business English world, even if you're not doing Ielts, there's something for everybody that you can use, complete that loop, complete the series of the four episodes in our summer series in the month of July and follow all three shows.</p>
<p>But Michelle, it's all about our listeners.</p>
<p>That's why I was super excited to share an email from a listener where there was a request for a special shout out to a very special listener, Michelle.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Yes, this is very exciting.</p>
<p>We got this really sweet message from a listener, Lindsay.</p>
<p>Do you want to tell us about it? And what, what did, what did he want us to do? Yeah.</p>
<p>So Andres Burgos Bravo from Bogota Colombia is one of our longtime amazing loyal listeners and he listens to the show with his daughter Isabella Burgos and they listen together and it's so cool Michelle for me to think about our listeners listening with their families, with new generations of all English listeners who believe in our motto, belief of connection being the most important thing.</p>
<p>When it comes to learning English, we learn to connect as human beings, right? Yes, this is great.</p>
<p>So, yeah, we wanted to give a shout out to Isabella and her classmates at the ST George School.</p>
<p>And then also, of course to her father for sending us this message, her father, Andres.</p>
<p>So thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you everyone for listening.</p>
<p>You guys.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>And thank you for that message.</p>
<p>It really made our day amazing.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>All right, Michelle, let's dive into this series.</p>
<p>So I am excited.</p>
<p>Where do we start today? Part one.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Lindsay.</p>
<p>Have you ever met anyone who shares your birthday? Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>I love when this happens.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>It's so cool because for some reason I think we think we're the only ones that have that date.</p>
<p>Yes, Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I actually, um, I think Obama's birthday is like two or three days after mine.</p>
<p>So that's kind of cool.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Wow, that is cool.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So Lindsay, we've talked on this show before about somebody sharing a name, sharing your name and how to, how to navigate that conversation and how to connect with somebody over that.</p>
<p>But today we're going to get into birthdays.</p>
<p>But it's, I feel even though it seems like it would be more rare to meet somebody with your name, it's actually, I feel very uncommon to meet somebody with your birthday, but it does happen.</p>
<p>Um, and so today we're going to talk about when you're inquiring about people's birthdays because a lot of times when just for an example in my life, if I'm talking to a parent at the park and they say, oh, their, their child has their birthday coming up in April and let's say I have a relative with a birthday in April or my birthday is in April.</p>
<p>I might like that person might just say, oh in April.</p>
<p>And if that birthday means something to you, if that month means something to you or your family, it's kind of fun to see.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Oh, when is it? Um, so you might ask them for more information.</p>
<p>Maybe somebody shares your birthday or somebody's the birthday of someone, you know.</p>
<p>So, what do you think about this, Lindsay? Yeah, I think you're totally right.</p>
<p>And this is a fantastic idea for a series because there is some kind of camaraderie that we find similar to the name, but maybe even stronger because it is more rare.</p>
<p>At least in my experience it's probably happened 234 times in my life that I've found someone that has August 3rd, maybe one of our listeners has, has that day.</p>
<p>But you do feel this sense of whoa, something's going on with us, right? We connected in a way and even if it's not exactly the date, it's still fun to test the waters.</p>
<p>Or maybe it's the same date of somebody I know or maybe it's like, you know, oh, my brother's birthday is in February.</p>
<p>If somebody says, 00, my birthday's in February, I might say, oh, February, what? Just out of curiosity to see if you find a match and even if it's close, it's still, it's still kind of fun.</p>
<p>But I find that this conversation comes up a lot actually when, when a birthday comes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I know that kids talk about birthdays, like, when's your birthday? But it's not just kids that have this conversation.</p>
<p>It's adults, you know, we all want to know ways in which we connect with people that are unexpected.</p>
<p>I think it comes back to our minds as human beings.</p>
<p>How do we connect? How do we fit in and having the same birthday is a big, is a big deal in a sense.</p>
<p>It's fun to discover this, you know, definitely.</p>
<p>So let's talk about how this conversation may go and give some ways to also contribute to the conversation.</p>
<p>So let's get started here.</p>
<p>So simple way is if it comes up, just ask, so you could just say, when's your birthday? Right? That's the, that's the easiest if somebody said, for example, imagine you were talking to somebody and it's, let's say that it's the second week of July and the person says, oh, yeah, I was uh last week I went, I my friends threw me a surprise birthday party.</p>
<p>Wouldn't you kind of want to know? Of course, you have the same birthday.</p>
<p>It's also just a, I'm sorry, I did it again.</p>
<p>August, what did you do? August? I said the second week of July.</p>
<p>It's about your birthday.</p>
<p>That's ok.</p>
<p>I don't take it personally.</p>
<p>It's because you love July 4th so much.</p>
<p>That's what it is.</p>
<p>I just, I just think of that as being your birthday.</p>
<p>Just July and August somewhere in that range is my birthday.</p>
<p>You don't need to know the exact date.</p>
<p>It's Ok.</p>
<p>Yeah, I also think, you know, on this show we talk a lot about how do we extend the conversation? I think a big fear we might have is, oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>I don't know any follow up questions to ask.</p>
<p>This.</p>
<p>Is it? Oh, we had a birthday party last weekend.</p>
<p>Oh, when's your birthday? Right, Even if you aren't necessarily looking to connect over a specific birthday, it's still fun to say, oh, when is it? And then you never know where it's going to go from there.</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>This is just something to say, to keep the conversation going.</p>
<p>So what else Michelle, where do we go? So let's say the person says their birthday or someone's birthday is in a month that's meaningful to you.</p>
<p>You have a birthday then you know someone, your your parents have a birthday, then whatever it is.</p>
<p>So you might say, oh month, the month and then say what? Just easy, just easy like that.</p>
<p>So for example, you could say, oh October, what? Yeah, it's kind of interesting because we can't say October when but we can say October what meaning? Meaning which date in October is your birthday, right? And we, and we do that a lot just with dates in general.</p>
<p>We say, oh, I have a a I'm going on vacation starting the second week in August.</p>
<p>Oh, ok.</p>
<p>Oh wait, August.</p>
<p>What? Right, We do that a lot with dates in general.</p>
<p>And we do that with names too, don't we? When we're looking for someone's last name, it's John.</p>
<p>John, why don't we say John? What, like for the last name? Now I'm forgetting what we say we do.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>That'll be another episode for another day, another day.</p>
<p>But yeah, so using this, what is an actually kind of a high level function here guys that works, at least for today's episode.</p>
<p>Just remember it's for dates, right? October what October 12th, right? Or you could also say when in October or when in December, right? So when in and then the month.</p>
<p>But yeah, you wouldn't say it is interesting.</p>
<p>You wouldn't say October when, but you could say when in October.</p>
<p>That's weird.</p>
<p>That's weird.</p>
<p>We don't make the rules, we just explain them.</p>
<p>We try to or what's another way you could ask just a simple way.</p>
<p>Oh, what date, what date? And that one feels less natural, but it makes sense, you know, um, that one's great.</p>
<p>And then Michelle, what's the next category? What's the next situation? Ok.</p>
<p>So the person tells you and let's say it's the same.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Wow, we made a connection.</p>
<p>We have a match.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So you could, you could say, oh, that's Blank's birthday.</p>
<p>So you could say, oh, that's my sister's birthday or? Oh, that's my birthday too, right? Oh, that's Blank's birthday, right? And I don't think you need a fake excitement when this happens because I think most people are just excited, you know, it's just one of those cool moments in life.</p>
<p>Like I said, my people are like, oh, no, I own that date.</p>
<p>No one else.</p>
<p>There are millions of people or maybe not millions but thousands of people in the world that share that date.</p>
<p>Right? Um And then some people say twins, right? If, if it is the same date, you would only say that for if it's about you and the other person or somebody who's there, maybe, like if I was talking to, if I'm at the park with my daughter and somebody there, there's another, you know, person there and they find they have the same birthday and I might say, oh, twins.</p>
<p>Right, So it has to be somebody who is really in the place, I think.</p>
<p>And that's also kind of like a cute thing if, you know, you know, if that doesn't feel right in the workplace, for example, you could easily end up having this conversation in your break room at work or at a happy hour at work or something.</p>
<p>But if that twins doesn't feel it's a little cutesy, it's right.</p>
<p>You know what I mean? It's a little juvenile.</p>
<p>So if it doesn't feel right, don't use it.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>That's the, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Good point.</p>
<p>Lindsay.</p>
<p>Good point.</p>
<p>So now, but most likely the person will tell you and it's not going to be the same.</p>
<p>Right, It's more common that that would have.</p>
<p>So that would happen.</p>
<p>So you could say, oh, blank the blank, right? So, so sorry, that doesn't blank, blank, blank, blank blank.</p>
<p>That'll be the title of today's episode.</p>
<p>Blank the blank.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>For example, you could say, oh, I'm the 13th, right? So somebody says, oh, like it would be a little bit awkward if somebody said, oh, my birthday is June 2nd and, and your birthday is, you know, June 11th and you just say, oh, ok.</p>
<p>Right, You, 000, ok.</p>
<p>Actually, you know, then it sounds weird.</p>
<p>Why were you asking? Why were you, you know, so you would want to share? Oh, I'm the 13th or? Oh, my brother is the, is the fourth or something like that.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Close that conversation loop.</p>
<p>Show them why you were, you were asking why you were excited to know and then move on.</p>
<p>Right, Don't be weird and like leave a hanging thread in a conversation that can feel very awkward for people, for sure.</p>
<p>All right, Michelle, I am excited to, well, we're running out of time but do we think we have time for the role play or do we want to choose one of these? What do you say? Do you want to choose one? Ok.</p>
<p>Let's do the second one.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>We're in the workplace in this case and here we go.</p>
<p>All right, I'm taking off for my birthday.</p>
<p>I'm so excited.</p>
<p>When's your birthday? July? Oh, wow.</p>
<p>July.</p>
<p>What the 18th? Oh, that's my mom's birthday.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>See, that's nice.</p>
<p>That's a, this happens all the time and we've shown you guys, let's just go back through it real quick.</p>
<p>Michelle.</p>
<p>I, you know you said, oh, I'm taking off for my birthday.</p>
<p>I'm so excited.</p>
<p>I said you said when's your birthday? And what, what is the, the contraction there? It's when is, when is, when is your birthday? Right? You said July? And so now you're, you're, it's actually not a bad idea to go broad when you answer that right.</p>
<p>July, you don't always, if someone asks you that you don't always have to say the exact date and you definitely don't have to say the year.</p>
<p>That's another conversation.</p>
<p>That is another conversation.</p>
<p>And then you said, oh wow, July, what? Because now you hear a month that's meaningful to you.</p>
<p>And so you're kind of curious, maybe it's the same day.</p>
<p>Yes, I love it.</p>
<p>Oh July, what? And then you said the 18th? And then you said, oh, that's my mom's birthday.</p>
<p>And then you're going to say that with a sense of, I don't know, a positive energy.</p>
<p>Probably a little enthusiasm you want to say, oh yeah, that's my mom's birthday, right? No, you, oh yeah, you do feel a sense of affinity.</p>
<p>You feel closer to the person, even if they share a birthday with a family member, if you're close to that family member, it's just, yeah, it's just how we're wired as human beings.</p>
<p>You know? It's true.</p>
<p>It's kind of funny, but it's true.</p>
<p>It's really interesting.</p>
<p>And that's what we're interested here in all English.</p>
<p>How do we find those connection moments and then use English to build that connection even further instead of getting upset, feeling like a perfectionist and focusing on our errors.</p>
<p>Right, Right, And of course, I mean, especially if your birthday comes at an interesting time of the month.</p>
<p>Right? Like so my birthday being December 30th.</p>
<p>00 my, my mom's birthday is December 30th.</p>
<p>0, do you ever get to celebrate your birthday? Really? Or does it just get smooshed in with a holiday? Right, Then you can continue the conversation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And we may come back into this topic, right? So it's so it's not just about, oh, that date is my brother's day.</p>
<p>The dates, it's about the larger conversation around the season, the time of year.</p>
<p>What was typical when you were a kid? How is it now? Like I said before, at the beginning, the contrast between when I was in school and you too, Michelle Wright being in school and like not having the chance to have other kids celebrate versus life as an adult having a summer birthday.</p>
<p>I mean, I talked to the lady drawing my blood for like five minutes about this and we laughed and we connected and that's, this is life.</p>
<p>This is connection here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So, wow, we did a lot today.</p>
<p>This is a really fun way to connect.</p>
<p>Guys.</p>
<p>Listen to the next episode again, that is going to be on the Business English podcast again, business.</p>
