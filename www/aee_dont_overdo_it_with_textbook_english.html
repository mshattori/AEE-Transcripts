<p id="p-15">I'm feeling pretty good.</p>
<p id="p-16">I'm excited to go to Run Club tonight.</p>
<p id="p-17">What about you? What's going on? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-18">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-19">I am good.</p>
<p id="p-20">I'm good.</p>
<p id="p-21">My kids are going to be starting school soon, so that's exciting.</p>
<p id="p-22">And I'm excited.</p>
<p id="p-23">I am happy it's going to be fall.</p>
<p id="p-24">I think I've had enough.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-25">it's gonna be fall.</p>
<p id="p-26">I think I've had enough.</p>
<p id="p-27">Oh, you've had enough of summer.</p>
<p id="p-28">Yeah, I get that.</p>
<p id="p-29">I get that.</p>
<p id="p-30">Well, hopefully, you know, yeah, seasons change, and especially in the Northeast, you get a lot of nice changing of the seasons.</p>
<p id="p-31">Yeah, really good stuff.</p>
<p id="p-32">I'm gonna regret saying that soon when I'm freezing in the morning.</p>
<p id="p-33">Yeah, we'll hear about it, I'm sure.</p>
<p id="p-34">Yeah, no, no, no.</p>
<p id="p-35">Why is it so cold? Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-36">I'm the weather complainer.</p>
<p id="p-37">Well, anyway, Lindsay, but I have a question for you.</p>
<p id="p-38">Have you ever been overcharged at a restaurant? Oh, have I? Maybe, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-39">Yeah, like the wrong charge, you mean? Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>
<p id="p-40">Yeah, it happened to me recently at the grocery store.</p>
<p id="p-41">Someone charged me for like 17 cabbages.</p>
<p id="p-42">Like, what? Or something like that.</p>
<p id="p-43">I know, it was so funny.</p>
<p id="p-44">But like, that's kind of a high bill, because we always look at the receipt, and there were like 17 of them.</p>
<p id="p-45">They just made a mistake.</p>
<p id="p-46">They just went fast, you know? Oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-47">That's hilarious.</p>
<p id="p-48">What would somebody do with 17 cabbages? Make a lot of stew?</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-49">Make a lot of stew.</p>
<p id="p-50">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-51">I guess so.</p>
<p id="p-52">So how did you so you told them what happened? yeah, we just went back in and just politely said we think there was a mistake and Then yeah, they just they just solved it for us.</p>
<p id="p-53">But what about you? Has it ever happened to you at an actual restaurant? I'm sure it has nothing's coming off the top of my head But those those things just happen from time to time just yeah mistakes like that or whatever it is But yeah today we're actually going to be talking about this Prefix over right so because I said overcharged so we're gonna be talking about that in just a second But we today we are excited because we've been doing these Spotify polls And we are going to share the results of one of them today Yeah, this was back from episode Well an episode on a Saturday.</p>
<p id="p-54">Do you bicker with your family a few weeks ago?</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-55">family a few weeks ago.</p>
<p id="p-56">And we asked you the question, who do you squabble with the most? Meaning fight with, right? And I'm not surprised about the first one, Michelle, what is it? The highest percentage.</p>
<p id="p-57">So the highest one is your partner.</p>
<p id="p-58">So that was almost 28%.</p>
<p id="p-59">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-60">That's who you fight with the most.</p>
<p id="p-61">It makes sense to me.</p>
<p id="p-62">That's kind of who you're around the most, right? As an adult, that's who you live with day in, day out.</p>
<p id="p-63">There are things about your partner you don't like for sure.</p>
<p id="p-64">And then the second one also to me makes sense as siblings, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-65">So this was 26% of you.</p>
<p id="p-66">I think it makes sense, especially if you're close to them.</p>
<p id="p-67">You know, if you're not super close to your sibling, you also, when people's parents pass away, there might be some bickering, some fighting, arguing, not a good thing.</p>
<p id="p-68">Then parents, right? 21.6%.</p>
<p id="p-69">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-70">And then what else, Michelle? Then friends, 17.4%.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-71">And friends, 17.4%.</p>
<p id="p-72">Now, yeah, you'll notice, I feel like it's kind of going further and further away, right? Somebody, so you spend the most time with your partner, you might fight with them the most.</p>
<p id="p-73">Siblings, parents, they're also extremely just close to you.</p>
<p id="p-74">And then friends might not be as much because you don't have to be as tied to them.</p>
<p id="p-75">And then colleagues are even the least, right? It goes all the way down.</p>
<p id="p-76">The furthest out, 7.8%, about 8% of you bicker the most with colleagues.</p>
<p id="p-77">So that doesn't make sense.</p>
<p id="p-78">I mean, whoever we're closest to, we tend to fight with the most.</p>
<p id="p-79">Makes total sense.</p>
<p id="p-80">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-81">So very, very interesting.</p>
<p id="p-82">So okay, well, we are about to answer that question.</p>
<p id="p-83">But we also want to remind you guys that we have this great app.</p>
<p id="p-84">If you don't have it already, it's the All Ears English app available on iOS and Android.</p>
<p id="p-85">Lindsay, tell us about that.</p>
<p id="p-86">Yeah, well, what we like about the app the most this season is that we now have different listening speeds.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-87">have different listening speeds.</p>
<p id="p-88">So there are no other apps that I know of where you could listen to a podcast, an episode of this show at 0.8x or 0.9x or 1.1x or 1.2x.</p>
<p id="p-89">If you want to challenge yourself a little bit more, you can do that over on the app.</p>
<p id="p-90">Plus you get transcripts, your personal power list of vocabulary episodes, really good stuff, guys.</p>
<p id="p-91">Go over to ullersenglish.com app to sign up.</p>
<p id="p-92">All right.</p>
<p id="p-93">Okay, great.</p>
<p id="p-94">So love it.</p>
<p id="p-95">And this question today comes to us from Ben from Japan.</p>
<p id="p-96">Lindsay, would you like to read it? I would love to.</p>
<p id="p-97">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-98">Hi, Ullers English team.</p>
<p id="p-99">This is Ben from Japan.</p>
<p id="p-100">It's been five months since I found your podcast program for the first time.</p>
<p id="p-101">I've learned a lot from your topics in the program since then.</p>
<p id="p-102">Well, that's so good to hear, Ben.</p>
<p id="p-103">We're happy to have you as a listener.</p>
<p id="p-104">Yes, Anyway, I have a question for you.</p>
<p id="p-105">There are a lot of verbs with over something, such as over.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-106">something, such as overestimate, overcharge, overhear, overload, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-107">Is there common meaning among them? Can you explain these words you frequently use? Great question, Ben.</p>
<p id="p-108">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-109">Well, thank you, Ben, for that question.</p>
<p id="p-110">And the wildest thing was, I was planning this episode and someone texted me something that said, I don't want to overlook something.</p>
<p id="p-111">Weird, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-112">It was.</p>
<p id="p-113">Was there some kind of strange AI thing happening in your world? Did Alexa come on and say something to you, AI or something? I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-114">Yeah, it was wild.</p>
<p id="p-115">And I will go over what that means in a second.</p>
<p id="p-116">But yeah, I wasn't going to teach that one.</p>
<p id="p-117">And then I thought, oh my gosh, that's it's the coolest thing when that happens when I'm planning episodes.</p>
<p id="p-118">That's really cool.</p>
<p id="p-119">I think it makes sense, though, because these are, as I was saying, Ben's question, overestimate, overcharge, overhear, overload, they are super common.</p>
<p id="p-120">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-121">Very common.</p>
<p id="p-122">So yeah, this is about.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-123">So yeah, this is about using that prefix over so when added to a word What is over usually mean? I think it generally means too much.</p>
<p id="p-124">Yeah too much of something.</p>
<p id="p-125">Yeah More than needed so but we're gonna go over this.</p>
<p id="p-126">Let's go through these words that Ben asked about.</p>
<p id="p-127">Let's start with those and Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-128">So Overestimate Yeah, I over I just you estimated too high too much of something, right? So for example, I overestimated how much food I needed for the party That can happen sometimes Yes Yeah, absolutely Mess up the shopping lists or if you go to Costco or somewhere where you're buying in bulk and you think oh, yeah Do I need one giant package for this party or two and you go with two and then you have leftover for three? Leftovers for three weeks that no one wants.</p>
<p id="p-129">Yeah, it's the famous Costco effect, right?</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-130">It's the famous Costco effect, right? The famous Costco.</p>
<p id="p-131">You go in for one thing and you come out with an entire pantry worth of things.</p>
<p id="p-132">Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-133">So another thing that's interesting is, do you ever hear somebody say, you overestimate me or you overestimate my ability to handle technology or something like that? What does that mean to you when used like that? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-134">It kind of means you're saying you give me too much credit.</p>
<p id="p-135">Maybe you received a compliment about something.</p>
<p id="p-136">You're so great at technology because you fixed it.</p>
<p id="p-137">Maybe the computer shut down.</p>
<p id="p-138">You fixed it.</p>
<p id="p-139">Oh, you overestimate me.</p>
<p id="p-140">I just, you know, I just knew one thing that happened to be the key thing.</p>
<p id="p-141">Right? Right, Right, And I wouldn't, I wouldn't really recommend saying this too much, right? Because it's kind of, kind of rejecting a compliment.</p>
<p id="p-142">Self-deprecating.</p>
<p id="p-143">It's a little self-deprecating.</p>
<p id="p-144">So, but something that you might hear.</p>
<p id="p-145">The next one is overcharged.</p>
<p id="p-146">So we already did this one, but yeah, charged too much.</p>
<p id="p-147">Like our example from the beginning.</p>
<p id="p-148">So you might say, I'm sorry.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-149">So you might say I'm sorry, but I think you overcharged me for the coffee So maybe you know when you go and you get a coffee if you ever get anything extra Maybe you get some sort of special milk or you get some sort of special syrup in it some flavoring But maybe someone charged you for something that you didn't get Yeah for sure and remember guys you always have the option to put that in the passive voice if you want to kind of take It does go a little direct.</p>
<p id="p-150">Am I in the wrong environment? Right, so you could always say I'm sorry, but I think I was overcharged charged.</p>
<p id="p-151">Yep Away a little bit.</p>
<p id="p-152">You're not so direct or maybe sound you might you're not gonna offend Someone if you yeah, it's just hard, you know in coffee shops.</p>
<p id="p-153">Sometimes like people are just tired They've been working all day could be crowded You don't want to add to the to the the challenge of being a barista behind the counter that day Right if they're having a bad day, so putting into the passive voice you can still use The word right which is fantastic</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-154">the word, right, which is fantastic and thinking about different ways to say things.</p>
<p id="p-155">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-156">Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p id="p-157">Okay, Michelle, over here is our next one.</p>
<p id="p-158">Tell me about this.</p>
<p id="p-159">This one's interesting.</p>
<p id="p-160">Yeah, this is interesting because I was thinking, does this really work with the too much? And it's a little bit different, but you could justify it.</p>
<p id="p-161">So you're hearing too much, basically.</p>
<p id="p-162">Maybe you're hearing something you're not supposed to, not something that isn't supposed to be heard.</p>
<p id="p-163">So in a way, it does work with that over.</p>
<p id="p-164">What do you think, Lindsay? I think it works.</p>
<p id="p-165">I think it works.</p>
<p id="p-166">Right here, you heard too much, more than you should have.</p>
<p id="p-167">But it really just means maybe you eavesdropped or you just happened to hear something that you shouldn't have heard.</p>
<p id="p-168">So I overheard them talking, and I think you may want to start looking for a new job.</p>
<p id="p-169">Uh-oh.</p>
<p id="p-170">That's not good.</p>
<p id="p-171">Yikes.</p>
<p id="p-172">Budget cuts.</p>
<p id="p-173">Budget cuts.</p>
<p id="p-174">Not good.</p>
<p id="p-175">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-176">Oh, that's worse.</p>
<p id="p-177">But common, right? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-178">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-179">I think that's a good question.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-180">often you could overhear conversations.</p>
<p id="p-181">I remember when I lived in New York, I used to enjoy just overhearing conversations, right? Or even in Japan, I would try to listen and try to understand what people are saying because I was learning Japanese.</p>
<p id="p-182">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-183">It's just kind of a fun thing on the subway.</p>
<p id="p-184">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-185">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-186">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-187">So over here, though, on eavesdrop, I think there's a slight difference because when I hear overhear, it sounds a little bit less purposeful.</p>
<p id="p-188">Totally.</p>
<p id="p-189">That's a good point.</p>
<p id="p-190">Right, So if you're wondering about a difference, guys, you could try to overhear something, but it's a little eavesdrop is more direct.</p>
<p id="p-191">You were going for it.</p>
<p id="p-192">You wanted to hear.</p>
<p id="p-193">Oh, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-194">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-195">It's a really important difference.</p>
<p id="p-196">And so then if you want to say that in that context, you could essentially be trying to add a layer of meaning by saying you're a little ashamed of that.</p>
<p id="p-197">Right, Sometimes I would try to overhear.</p>
<p id="p-198">Do you know what I mean? There's a little bit of a.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-199">Do you know what I mean? There's a little bit of a subtext there that I'm...</p>
<p id="p-200">Yes, So we're getting into super high levels of fluency, but I think our listeners are ready for it, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-201">Yes, Is there another one? Is there another? Oh, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-202">We're still going for it.</p>
<p id="p-203">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-204">So we have overload.</p>
<p id="p-205">Our listener asked about this one as well.</p>
<p id="p-206">So to put on more than can be held.</p>
<p id="p-207">So for example, he overloaded the truck, so the tire actually broke.</p>
<p id="p-208">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-209">I mean, at home, some common things.</p>
<p id="p-210">I'm famous for overloading the dishwasher, the washing machine, the dryer, all of these things.</p>
<p id="p-211">Let me just jam some more in there.</p>
<p id="p-212">We don't want to leave it.</p>
<p id="p-213">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-214">You don't want anything.</p>
<p id="p-215">You want to just get it done.</p>
<p id="p-216">It's a Sunday.</p>
<p id="p-217">Try to finish your chores.</p>
<p id="p-218">No.</p>
<p id="p-219">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-220">Overload.</p>
<p id="p-221">This also makes me think of the expression information overload or cuteness overload or things like that.</p>
<p id="p-222">We could do a whole episode about that.</p>
<p id="p-223">But yeah, too much information or there's too much in my head, whatever.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-224">too much in my head, whatever it could be.</p>
<p id="p-225">So these were the ones that our listener asked us about.</p>
<p id="p-226">Would you like to continue with a couple? Let's throw in maybe one more, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-227">Do we have more? Why don't you choose your favorite? Okay, so I really like oversee because this could also apply at work, right? To oversee.</p>
<p id="p-228">It doesn't really mean though what we've been defining this as, to see too much.</p>
<p id="p-229">The meaning changes with this one a little bit.</p>
<p id="p-230">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-231">Right, right, right, right.</p>
<p id="p-232">However, every time I found one that didn't quite work, I was able to think deeply about it and realize, oh, okay, well, it kind of works, but it's a little bit tough.</p>
<p id="p-233">But basically to see more because you are the leader in a way.</p>
<p id="p-234">Does that make sense? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-235">But don't think about it like that, guys, just making it more complicated.</p>
<p id="p-236">It just means to direct.</p>
<p id="p-237">Let's say the verb.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-238">To direct.</p>
<p id="p-239">Let's say the verb to direct a project.</p>
<p id="p-240">You're the director or the manager of a project.</p>
<p id="p-241">You're in charge of a project.</p>
<p id="p-242">So, you kind of have that bird's eye view in a sense, right? You're a piers.</p>
<p id="p-243">You can see more.</p>
<p id="p-244">I think that's what it is.</p>
<p id="p-245">There you go.</p>
<p id="p-246">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-247">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-248">So, for example, Jen is going to oversee the projects.</p>
<p id="p-249">Very common vocabulary for the workplace.</p>
<p id="p-250">And by the way, Michelle, where should our listeners go if they do want to get that business English vocabulary? Oh, well, I'm so glad you asked.</p>
<p id="p-251">We are over on the Business English Podcast.</p>
<p id="p-252">It is me and Lindsay and Aubrey, and we talk about all sorts of things dealing with business English.</p>
<p id="p-253">But even if, no matter what, we talk about real life things, right? So, because you're not a robot just because you're in the workplace.</p>
<p id="p-254">You got it, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-255">You are not a robot.</p>
<p id="p-256">All right.</p>
<p id="p-257">So, where do we go from here? Where do we go from here? Well, there are so, so, so many more, but this gives you the most basic idea of what it means.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-258">idea of what it means.</p>
<p id="p-259">So should we do a role play? Let's do it.</p>
<p id="p-260">So Michelle, in this case, you are a customer and I'm the barista.</p>
<p id="p-261">Okay, so we're in that scenario.</p>
<p id="p-262">All right, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-263">All right, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-264">Thank you so much.</p>
<p id="p-265">Oh, wait, I'm sorry.</p>
<p id="p-266">Oh, I think you may have overcharged me for this cappuccino.</p>
<p id="p-267">Oh no, really? Oh no, it's overflowing.</p>
<p id="p-268">Let me get you a napkin.</p>
<p id="p-269">Oh, thank you.</p>
<p id="p-270">I'll take a sip.</p>
<p id="p-271">Wow.</p>
<p id="p-272">It's great how the vanilla flavor doesn't overpower the coffee.</p>
<p id="p-273">Isn't that good? Okay, so I'm so sorry.</p>
<p id="p-274">I overestimated how much milk you wanted.</p>
<p id="p-275">That's okay.</p>
<p id="p-276">I like it.</p>
<p id="p-277">Okay, good.</p>
<p id="p-278">And sorry for overcharging you.</p>
<p id="p-279">I'll fix it right now.</p>
<p id="p-280">Thanks.</p>
<p id="p-281">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-282">So chaotic moment.</p>
<p id="p-283">Yes, it is a little bit of chaos here.</p>
<p id="p-284">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-285">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-286">I like that.</p>
<p id="p-287">I like that.</p>
<p id="p-288">These scenarios are so creative, right? How do we get in all these over words into one moment in a cafe? I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-289">I just got to figure it out.</p>
<p id="p-290">I got to over.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-291">I just got to figure it out.</p>
<p id="p-292">I got to overload these role plays.</p>
<p id="p-293">So, but with the vocabulary.</p>
<p id="p-294">So some of these were ones we taught already.</p>
<p id="p-295">Some of these might be a little bit new, but we can go through it.</p>
<p id="p-296">So the first one we know, I said, I'm sorry, I think you may have overcharged me for the cappuccino.</p>
<p id="p-297">And I could have said, I think I was overcharged.</p>
<p id="p-298">However, I think the fact that I said, you may have softened it also a little bit.</p>
<p id="p-299">That's a good point.</p>
<p id="p-300">It's not always just putting things in the passive voice to soften a little bit.</p>
<p id="p-301">There are other words instead of might, or instead of you did, you may have done this thing, right? Much, also very good to soften the blow of what you're about to say.</p>
<p id="p-302">And then I said, oh no, really? Oh no, it's overflowing.</p>
<p id="p-303">So there's some things that are happening.</p>
<p id="p-304">I'm realizing I overcharged you.</p>
<p id="p-305">And then I'm also, I guess maybe handing it to you or still doing the thing, making the cappuccino.</p>
<p id="p-306">Yeah, it's overflowing.</p>
<p id="p-307">So meaning the milk or the coffee's coming out.</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p id="p-308">or the coffee's coming out over the top of the cup, right? Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-309">Big problem, especially with hot coffee.</p>
<p id="p-310">So I said, I'll take a sip.</p>
<p id="p-311">You know that moment when something is overflowing, so you just kind of have to do that awkward bend over a cup.</p>
<p id="p-312">And you just have to carefully, even if it's super, right? We've all been in that situation.</p>
<p id="p-313">I wish we could throw a photo on the screen right now of a moment we've had to do that.</p>
<p id="p-314">It's very awkward.</p>
<p id="p-315">Just imagine it.</p>
<p id="p-316">Imagine it, I'm sure.</p>
<p id="p-317">Yes, yes.</p>
<p id="p-318">So I had to give it a try.</p>
<p id="p-319">So then I commented on it.</p>
<p id="p-320">And I said, wow, it's great how the vanilla flavor doesn't overpower the coffee.</p>
<p id="p-321">So overpower is another one, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-322">And I really like this one in the context of food.</p>
<p id="p-323">Because if you watch any cooking shows, which I do in the winter all the time, all the Tournament of Champions and all this, where they really analyze these dishes.</p>
<p id="p-324">And they say, this flavor overpowers that.</p>
<p id="p-325">And that's the reason that points get docked off, right? They go into all the new ones.</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p id="p-326">off, right? They go into all the nuances.</p>
<p id="p-327">It's just incredible, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-328">It's incredible.</p>
<p id="p-329">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-330">Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-331">So I'm saying the vanilla flavor doesn't overpower the coffee.</p>
<p id="p-332">So am I saying that the vanilla flavor is stronger than the coffee or weaker? No, we're saying it's kind of even, or it's just, it's in proportion to what it should be.</p>
<p id="p-333">It's in proportion period.</p>
<p id="p-334">Like it's in the right amounts, right? You can still taste the coffee.</p>
<p id="p-335">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-336">Like the power of the coffee.</p>
<p id="p-337">So it doesn't over take more power, right? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-338">When I first started drinking coffee, my gateway drug, my gateway coffee was a vanilla latte from Starbucks, right? And I feel like a lot of people, that's what that is because it really does overpower.</p>
<p id="p-339">I mean, first of all, a latte milk and all these things, then vanilla latte, you have the flavor, you have the milk, and then you kind of taste the coffee.</p>
<p id="p-340">It's a gateway.</p>
<p id="p-341">Right, right, right.</p>
<p id="p-342">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-343">Yes, And sometimes if I get a coffee and I get</p>
<h2>Part-21</h2>
<p id="p-344">Yes, And sometimes if I get a coffee and I get a little flavor in it, then it's one too many pumps.</p>
<p id="p-345">And yeah, I don't, I don't do it.</p>
<p id="p-346">I don't do the flavored stuff anymore.</p>
<p id="p-347">Black coffee.</p>
<p id="p-348">Um, you're, you're so tough, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-349">I'm so cool.</p>
<p id="p-350">Um, all right.</p>
<p id="p-351">Isn't.</p>
<p id="p-352">And then I said, isn't that good? Right, So I'm obviously nerding out about the coffee I just made you.</p>
<p id="p-353">Right, I'm really excited.</p>
<p id="p-354">It's probably a high end coffee shop where the barista really gets into it.</p>
<p id="p-355">And these places do exist.</p>
<p id="p-356">Maybe they made a little heart in the coffee.</p>
<p id="p-357">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-358">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-359">They'll do that.</p>
<p id="p-360">That's, that's the thing.</p>
<p id="p-361">And then I say, okay, so I'm so sorry.</p>
<p id="p-362">I overestimated how much milk you wanted.</p>
<p id="p-363">Right, And that's the reason that I overcharged you.</p>
<p id="p-364">Right, So yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-365">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-366">Overestimate.</p>
<p id="p-367">So, and then, uh, you said, I'm sorry for overcharging you.</p>
<p id="p-368">I'll fix it.</p>
<p id="p-369">I'll fix it.</p>
<p id="p-370">All right.</p>
<p id="p-371">a great conversation and something you honestly might experience, uh, in a cafe, right? All these things are happening at the same time.</p>
<h2>Part-22</h2>
<p id="p-372">All these things are happening at the same time, right? That's what that's the funniest part about it Is that you have it's you're you have to put out all the fires We have the issue of the being overcharged and then oh, no, it's overflowing and then probably there's a line of ten people So it's all crazy For sure.</p>
