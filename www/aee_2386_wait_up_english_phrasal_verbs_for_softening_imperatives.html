<p id="p-20">Hello, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-21">How's it going today?</p>
<p id="p-22">I'm great, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-23">How are you?</p>
<p id="p-24">Good.</p>
<p id="p-25">Good.</p>
<p id="p-26">Have you ever heard anyone say the expression, wait up?</p>
<p id="p-27">Wait up?</p>
<p id="p-28">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-29">Yes, I say this to my husband a lot.</p>
<p id="p-30">He is notorious for walking like six steps ahead of me wherever we're going.</p>
<p id="p-31">We'll get out of the car and he's like headed to the restaurant.</p>
<p id="p-32">I'll be like, wait up.</p>
<p id="p-33">Like hold my hand while we're walking.</p>
<p id="p-34">He just doesn't notice.</p>
<p id="p-35">He's just like totally hurrying to get wherever we're going.</p>
<p id="p-36">I am in the same situation with my partner and this came up, I think when I was in New York and my partner also walks a lot faster than I do.</p>
<p id="p-37">And I remember we came out of a shop and I said, hey, wait up.</p>
<p id="p-38">Hey, wait up.</p>
<p id="p-39">And I'm running to try to keep up here.</p>
<p id="p-40">Don't ditch me.</p>
<p id="p-41">That's kind of a fun expression too.</p>
<p id="p-42">It just means</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-43">Oh, it's kind of an expression, too.</p>
<p id="p-44">It just means like you're leaving me.</p>
<p id="p-45">You're like ahead of me, right?</p>
<p id="p-46">Wait for me.</p>
<p id="p-47">Yeah, Aubrey, do you feel like your walking's gotten slower over the years?</p>
<p id="p-48">Because I kind of do.</p>
<p id="p-49">I feel like I used to be, when I lived in New York or even Boston, I used to be faster with my walking.</p>
<p id="p-50">No one walks as fast as New Yorkers.</p>
<p id="p-51">No, that's true.</p>
<p id="p-52">That's true.</p>
<p id="p-53">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-54">Jaywalking constantly, just like quickly walking across streets.</p>
<p id="p-55">Oh, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-56">For sure.</p>
<p id="p-57">So my gait's kind of slowed down.</p>
<p id="p-58">So I'm often saying this to people, hey, wait up.</p>
<p id="p-59">Hey, wait up, right?</p>
<p id="p-60">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-61">Yes, And I'm so excited to dive into this today.</p>
<p id="p-62">There are so many phrasal verbs that we use in English that have up.</p>
<p id="p-63">So we're sharing the most common ones today.</p>
<p id="p-64">You guys definitely want to add these to your conversations.</p>
<p id="p-65">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-66">This is going to be a hint of real English today.</p>
<p id="p-67">And we do want to make sure you guys know that our Professional English Level 1 course is coming out very, very soon, like in a few weeks.</p>
<p id="p-68">Aubrey, what should our listeners do to make sure they are the first to hear about this course?</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-69">to hear about this course.</p>
<p id="p-70">Yes, you want to get on the list, go to allearsenglish.com slash professional.</p>
<p id="p-71">This is going to be a fantastic course with a heavy focus on meetings, speaking, socializing, and small talk, all of the skills that you guys need in English.</p>
<p id="p-72">Yeah, we really took time to listen to our listeners and chat with you all about what are the main pain points that you're experiencing in your career, whether you're working in engineering or software or the medical world or the legal world, you're a lawyer, what are the things that you struggle with the most?</p>
<p id="p-73">And some of these things were meeting type situations.</p>
<p id="p-74">It doesn't always mean an official boardroom meeting.</p>
<p id="p-75">It could mean a standup meeting with three or four other engineers, right?</p>
<p id="p-76">That can be stressful.</p>
<p id="p-77">Updates, speaking, fluency, as well as socializing and small talk.</p>
<p id="p-78">So we put a heavy focus on these key pieces in professional level one, plus other things like grammar, vocabulary, the things we need to know to succeed at work.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-79">need to know to succeed at work.</p>
<p id="p-80">All right?</p>
<p id="p-81">Yes, we are so excited for you guys to check out this course.</p>
<p id="p-82">So be the first to know, go to allearsenglish.com slash professional.</p>
<p id="p-83">Yes, excellent.</p>
<p id="p-84">Well, let's dive deeper into today's topic, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-85">Where shall we start?</p>
<p id="p-86">All right, so today we're focusing on imperative phrasal verbs.</p>
<p id="p-87">So these are verbs that give a command or make a request, maybe give advice.</p>
<p id="p-88">But what we do is we add up to soften them a little.</p>
<p id="p-89">Because if you just say, wait, it's very urgent, right?</p>
<p id="p-90">It's like someone's going to stop panicked.</p>
<p id="p-91">Wait up softens it a little bit, a little bit less urgency.</p>
<p id="p-92">You're right.</p>
<p id="p-93">Wait does sound a lot more serious, a lot more urgent, but wait up is more, I don't know, it's more casual, more friendly, kind of funny.</p>
<p id="p-94">Imagine your partner's leaving that story and you're like, wait, what?</p>
<p id="p-95">What happened?</p>
<p id="p-96">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-97">Wait up is just like, wait for me.</p>
<p id="p-98">Hey, wait up, right?</p>
<p id="p-99">All right, good.</p>
<p id="p-100">So let's do a little role play here because...</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-101">Let's do a little role play here because yeah, let's do this.</p>
<p id="p-102">I'll start us.</p>
<p id="p-103">Are you leaving right now?</p>
<p id="p-104">Yeah, in five minutes.</p>
<p id="p-105">Oh, wait up.</p>
<p id="p-106">I'll come with you.</p>
<p id="p-107">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-108">And I could see using this at work as well as in our daily lives.</p>
<p id="p-109">Maybe your coworkers going downstairs for a coffee and you want to join them even though you're at work.</p>
<p id="p-110">We are human beings at work and we do say things like this.</p>
<p id="p-111">Hey, wait up.</p>
<p id="p-112">I'll join you for a coffee.</p>
<p id="p-113">Right?</p>
<p id="p-114">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-115">And you could say, wait, I'll come with you, but it's much less common because we often, often add this up just to soften it a little bit.</p>
<p id="p-116">And again, it always depends on who we're talking to at work.</p>
<p id="p-117">Are we talking to a close coworker versus a boss that we never talk with?</p>
<p id="p-118">We might select wait if it's that scenario, right?</p>
<p id="p-119">Right, Or wait just a second, right?</p>
<p id="p-120">Maybe we'll add a few words.</p>
<p id="p-121">Yeah, But I love this idea of adding the up and changing the meaning slightly.</p>
<p id="p-122">Let's see what other words, what other verbs do this?</p>
<p id="p-123">What are they?</p>
<p id="p-124">We also do it with open up.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-125">with open up.</p>
<p id="p-126">Imagine if you just said, open that or open it instead of open it up.</p>
<p id="p-127">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-128">It's interesting how it's almost more of an idiomatic meaning too.</p>
<p id="p-129">We use it most often idiomatically to talk about being vulnerable or open, right?</p>
<p id="p-130">I need them to open up, meaning like I need them to be vulnerable.</p>
<p id="p-131">I need them to be honest.</p>
<p id="p-132">Yeah, it's true.</p>
<p id="p-133">So we do use it psychologically.</p>
<p id="p-134">Maybe you're talking with your therapist and you need to open up more than you would or physical, right?</p>
<p id="p-135">Hey, open up, open up.</p>
<p id="p-136">I want to come in and I want to be the first customer to buy something.</p>
<p id="p-137">Open the door, open up.</p>
<p id="p-138">Yeah, And like gifts, right?</p>
<p id="p-139">Here's a quick role play how you would use this for like opening presents.</p>
<p id="p-140">Hey, I got you a present.</p>
<p id="p-141">Oh, thanks.</p>
<p id="p-142">That's exciting.</p>
<p id="p-143">Open it up.</p>
<p id="p-144">Right, So we hear this a lot.</p>
<p id="p-145">Maybe if you celebrate Christmas or other holidays, birthdays, come on, open it up, open it up.</p>
<p id="p-146">I'm so excited.</p>
<p id="p-147">Yes, And it is interesting, this slight change.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-148">It is interesting, the slight change if you said open it.</p>
<p id="p-149">It does feel a little more like a command.</p>
<p id="p-150">It just softens it just a little bit to say open it up.</p>
<p id="p-151">And it would be okay if you said open it, but it does feel, I don't know, more serious.</p>
<p id="p-152">A little more urgent.</p>
<p id="p-153">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-154">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-155">And then hurry up.</p>
<p id="p-156">I love this one.</p>
<p id="p-157">Hurry up, right?</p>
<p id="p-158">Yeah, so we could say hurry, but it softens it a little to say hurry.</p>
<p id="p-159">Actually, this is an interesting one because I think if you say hurry up, depending on the tone, it could almost be more harsh.</p>
<p id="p-160">Hurry up.</p>
<p id="p-161">Right, However you place the emphasis with the up could change the meaning even more.</p>
<p id="p-162">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-163">Let's do a role play where this would soften it a little.</p>
<p id="p-164">Instead of saying like, hurry, we're going to be late.</p>
<p id="p-165">I might say, hurry up, we're going to be late.</p>
<p id="p-166">Yeah, All right.</p>
<p id="p-167">How would you respond?</p>
<p id="p-168">What time were we supposed to be there?</p>
<p id="p-169">Seven.</p>
<p id="p-170">All right.</p>
<p id="p-171">So I'm starting with like, okay, hurry up, we're going to be late.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-172">Okay, hurry up.</p>
<p id="p-173">We're going to be late.</p>
<p id="p-174">I'm trying to stop in that.</p>
<p id="p-175">If I said like, hurry.</p>
<p id="p-176">But it's all about intonation with that one.</p>
<p id="p-177">And today's episode is all about giving our listeners options.</p>
<p id="p-178">You know, you can mix it up.</p>
<p id="p-179">Try the hurry and try hurry it up another time and see how it feels.</p>
<p id="p-180">See how people respond to you.</p>
<p id="p-181">That's what it is to build fluency.</p>
<p id="p-182">Yes, I have a little bonus here.</p>
<p id="p-183">Have you ever heard anyone say, where's your hurry?</p>
<p id="p-184">Like if you're moving really slowly and somebody like, where's your hurry?</p>
<p id="p-185">I think I have.</p>
<p id="p-186">My dad said this a lot.</p>
<p id="p-187">Okay, interesting.</p>
<p id="p-188">I haven't, I mean, I've heard it, but no one uses it in my world.</p>
<p id="p-189">So that's interesting.</p>
<p id="p-190">It might be more regional.</p>
<p id="p-191">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-192">You might hear that someone saying, where's your hurry?</p>
<p id="p-193">And what they mean is hurry up.</p>
<p id="p-194">You're being very slow.</p>
<p id="p-195">Where's your hurry?</p>
<p id="p-196">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-197">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-198">That's a good one.</p>
<p id="p-199">And then eat up, right?</p>
<p id="p-200">And I've seen different brand names will take this phrase.</p>
<p id="p-201">I feel like I've seen like the eat up cafe somewhere or something, you know?</p>
<p id="p-202">Yeah, And this is really</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-203">And this is really interesting where there are times where I would not say eat, but I'd say eat up.</p>
<p id="p-204">Like here's a role play where eat up makes a lot more sense.</p>
<p id="p-205">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-206">Thank you for inviting me to dinner.</p>
<p id="p-207">I hope you like it.</p>
<p id="p-208">Eat up.</p>
<p id="p-209">Yeah, So this one's really interesting, right?</p>
<p id="p-210">When would you say eat versus eat up?</p>
<p id="p-211">Because you wouldn't say if you had friends over, you wouldn't just say, I hope you like it.</p>
<p id="p-212">Eat alone.</p>
<p id="p-213">Eat.</p>
<p id="p-214">I would maybe say that is if my children were refusing to eat what I had made and I'm telling them over and over and insisting, I'm like, eat, just eat it.</p>
<p id="p-215">Right, But it's rare.</p>
<p id="p-216">It's rare that you're going to give that command.</p>
<p id="p-217">Eat.</p>
<p id="p-218">Yeah, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-219">So this makes it more friendly, allows it to be a command, right?</p>
<p id="p-220">With anyone other than your kids when you're angry at them, right?</p>
<p id="p-221">And another option here is dig in.</p>
<p id="p-222">This is even more common.</p>
<p id="p-223">Instead of saying eat up, you might say dig in.</p>
<p id="p-224">Yeah, Very casual, but great.</p>
<p id="p-225">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-226">Yes, Love it.</p>
<p id="p-227">And drink.</p>
<p id="p-228">Similarly, drink up.</p>
<p id="p-229">Yeah, Very similar.</p>
<p id="p-230">Same thing.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-231">Yeah, very similar.</p>
<p id="p-232">Same thing, you're not going to be like drink.</p>
<p id="p-233">Yeah, we'll say drink up, like have a drink.</p>
<p id="p-234">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-235">So for example, this wedding venue is so beautiful.</p>
<p id="p-236">Thanks for coming.</p>
<p id="p-237">It's an open bar, so drink up.</p>
<p id="p-238">Oh, dangerous.</p>
<p id="p-239">Very dangerous.</p>
<p id="p-240">We had some really good mixed drinks at my wedding and then a lot of people were very, very drunk.</p>
<p id="p-241">I can imagine.</p>
<p id="p-242">As a wedding should be.</p>
<p id="p-243">Yeah, that's how a wedding should be, right?</p>
<p id="p-244">That's normal, I guess.</p>
<p id="p-245">But you would never say, you know, it's an open bar, so drink.</p>
<p id="p-246">No, it just doesn't work.</p>
<p id="p-247">You need that extra up to make it friendly, make it casual, make it positive, right?</p>
<p id="p-248">Yes, and there are other ways to say this.</p>
<p id="p-249">You could say, so help yourselves, so go grab a drink, right?</p>
<p id="p-250">But you can also say, so drink up.</p>
<p id="p-251">No, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-252">And it does make it more casual than saying something like, please help yourself.</p>
<p id="p-253">That would be more formal.</p>
<p id="p-254">A little more formal, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-255">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-256">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-257">Okay, Aubrey, let's bring this into a role play.</p>
<p id="p-258">So here you are at my house for a birthday dinner.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-259">at my house for a birthday dinner, right?</p>
<p id="p-260">Yeah, it's your birthday.</p>
<p id="p-261">I'm at my friend Lindsay's birthday dinner.</p>
<p id="p-262">Yeah, my birthday.</p>
<p id="p-263">Woohoo.</p>
<p id="p-264">Okay, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-265">Yay, I'll start us out.</p>
<p id="p-266">Megan is late.</p>
<p id="p-267">I told her to hurry up and get here or we're going to order without her.</p>
<p id="p-268">We can wait if it's okay with you guys.</p>
<p id="p-269">Yeah, no worries.</p>
<p id="p-270">We're in no rush.</p>
<p id="p-271">You could wait and open your gifts after dessert.</p>
<p id="p-272">For sure.</p>
<p id="p-273">Thank you all for coming.</p>
<p id="p-274">Drink up everyone.</p>
<p id="p-275">Next round's on me.</p>
<p id="p-276">Oh, nice, nice.</p>
<p id="p-277">Good stuff.</p>
<p id="p-278">Lively birthday party here.</p>
<p id="p-279">So you started by... Megan is late.</p>
<p id="p-280">Megan's late.</p>
<p id="p-281">Not good.</p>
<p id="p-282">Not good.</p>
<p id="p-283">So we have our first up here.</p>
<p id="p-284">You said I told her to hurry up.</p>
<p id="p-285">Now could you have said I told her to hurry and get here?</p>
<p id="p-286">It makes it more serious, right?</p>
<p id="p-287">Yeah, it's interesting.</p>
<p id="p-288">I told her to hurry and get here or we're going to... I feel like hurry and hurry up is the one exception of all of them today that depending on the intonation, hurry up could actually sound more urgent, right?</p>
<p id="p-289">I told her to hurry and get here or we're going to...</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-290">I told her to hurry and get here or we're going to order without her.</p>
<p id="p-291">But then if I say, I told her to hurry up and get here, I'm changing my intonation and it sounds even more urgent or like I was even more impatient with her for being slow.</p>
<p id="p-292">Oh, interesting.</p>
<p id="p-293">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-294">So that one might be a little bit different.</p>
<p id="p-295">And again, I'm going to encourage our listeners just to listen for this.</p>
<p id="p-296">Listen for hurry, listen for hurry up and look at the scenarios in which they're used differently.</p>
<p id="p-297">Right?</p>
<p id="p-298">After we finish today.</p>
<p id="p-299">And then this next one, there's no up.</p>
<p id="p-300">And I want you guys to notice why.</p>
<p id="p-301">Lindsay said, we can wait if it's okay with you guys.</p>
<p id="p-302">If she said wait up, that would be strange.</p>
<p id="p-303">It would not fit here because this is where the verb wait is the only thing that fits.</p>
<p id="p-304">Wait up has a very specific meaning of like wait for me.</p>
<p id="p-305">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-306">That's a really good trick here.</p>
<p id="p-307">Right?</p>
<p id="p-308">It would be very strange.</p>
<p id="p-309">Again, it's when someone has gone ahead of you physically and you are, you know, your hands in the air.</p>
<p id="p-310">Hey, wait up, wait up.</p>
<p id="p-311">Just imagine me chasing after someone on the streets of New York.</p>
<p id="p-312">Right, And I just thought of a bonus.</p>
<p id="p-313">We say this a lot.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-314">And I just thought of a bonus.</p>
<p id="p-315">We say this a lot as well when we're talking about retiring for the night, like going to bed, like I'll wait up for you.</p>
<p id="p-316">It means I won't go to sleep before you do.</p>
<p id="p-317">We say that a lot.</p>
<p id="p-318">I'll wait up.</p>
<p id="p-319">Oh, can you wait up for me?</p>
<p id="p-320">I'll be there in 10 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-321">I feel like that's different, right?</p>
<p id="p-322">Because it's like, I'm going to wait awake.</p>
<p id="p-323">It's like when I think of wait up, I'm saying I'm going to wait being awake.</p>
<p id="p-324">You know what I mean?</p>
<p id="p-325">I'm not going to go to sleep before you.</p>
<p id="p-326">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-327">That's more idiomatic.</p>
<p id="p-328">Right, Totally more different, different meaning kind of in a way, right?</p>
<p id="p-329">Essentially.</p>
<p id="p-330">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-331">But the exact same words.</p>
<p id="p-332">That's why phrasal verbs are so confusing.</p>
<p id="p-333">This is why we love English.</p>
<p id="p-334">All right.</p>
<p id="p-335">And then what else?</p>
<p id="p-336">What else?</p>
<p id="p-337">I said you could wait and open up your gifts after dessert.</p>
<p id="p-338">This is one where open would mean the exact same.</p>
<p id="p-339">You could use both, right?</p>
<p id="p-340">You could wait and open your gifts after dessert.</p>
<p id="p-341">Both work.</p>
<p id="p-342">You can open up your gifts or open your gifts.</p>
<p id="p-343">And you might use both in the same sentence.</p>
<p id="p-344">You might say, oh, we'll open gifts later.</p>
<p id="p-345">And then it comes time.</p>
<p id="p-346">Come on, open it up.</p>
<p id="p-347">And you're moving back and forth between the two.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-348">And you're moving back and forth between the two.</p>
<p id="p-349">That's the most common scenario you're going to see for native speakers.</p>
<p id="p-350">And the difference is when it's a command, right?</p>
<p id="p-351">In this sentence, it's not a command.</p>
<p id="p-352">You could wait and open your gifts after dessert.</p>
<p id="p-353">But when it becomes a command saying, open it, it's so much more urgent seeming than open it up.</p>
<p id="p-354">Yes, All right.</p>
<p id="p-355">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-356">And then the next one.</p>
<p id="p-357">So I said, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-358">Thank you all for coming.</p>
<p id="p-359">And then you said, drink up, everyone.</p>
<p id="p-360">Next round's on me.</p>
<p id="p-361">Yeah, So in this scenario, when you're making an announcement, maybe you're holding a glass up, it would be weird to say, drink, everyone.</p>
<p id="p-362">Drink, everyone.</p>
<p id="p-363">You need a little something more to make it feel less awkward, right?</p>
<p id="p-364">Yes, This drink up is more of an expression.</p>
<p id="p-365">That means like, let's all have a drink.</p>
<p id="p-366">It's much more casual and friendly.</p>
<p id="p-367">More like a toast.</p>
<p id="p-368">More like a toast.</p>
<p id="p-369">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-370">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-371">Wow.</p>
<p id="p-372">This is a super nuanced topic, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-373">But I'm glad we went into it today.</p>
<p id="p-374">Same.</p>
<p id="p-375">There are so many</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-376">Same.</p>
<p id="p-377">There are so many phrasal verbs where we add up.</p>
<p id="p-378">We also do this a lot at work.</p>
<p id="p-379">There are phrasal verbs that we use both at work and in conversations like hold up, keep up.</p>
<p id="p-380">So we're going to do a part two over on Business English.</p>
<p id="p-381">Make sure you're following over there as well so you don't miss it.</p>
<p id="p-382">So open the search bar right now.</p>
<p id="p-383">Type in Business English and you'll see the yellow.</p>
<p id="p-384">All of our shows are bright yellow and go ahead and hit that follow button on Business English and then tune in over there to get the part two.</p>
<p id="p-385">Aubrey, what is our takeaway today?</p>
<p id="p-386">Yeah, well when you are giving a command, when you're using an imperative verb, it is often important to soften it and adding up is the best way to do that.</p>
<p id="p-387">You will give an impression if you use an imperative verb like wait, open it of urgency.</p>
<p id="p-388">And if you don't, if you want to be less urgent, be more casual, add up.</p>
<p id="p-389">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-390">And remember that as we make things more casual, it makes it easier to connect.</p>
<p id="p-391">And that's what we're always going for.</p>
<p id="p-392">So don't put pressure on yourself.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-393">So don't put pressure on yourself if something was confusing from today's episode.</p>
<p id="p-394">Listen again and then start listening to native English to identify when people are adding this up.</p>
<p id="p-395">You're looking for patterns.</p>
<p id="p-396">Right, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-397">Love it.</p>
