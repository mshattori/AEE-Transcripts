<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p id="p-10">A huge connection topic in American culture is Costco.</p>
<p id="p-11">Today, find out why Americans love Costco, how they talk about it, and how to build a connection based on this conversation topic.</p>
<p id="p-12">Hey there, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-13">How's it going?</p>
<p id="p-14">Good, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-15">How are you?</p>
<p id="p-16">Good, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-17">I have a question.</p>
<p id="p-18">You ready?</p>
<p id="p-19">Yeah, So do you have a particular grocery store that you are loyal to?</p>
<p id="p-20">Is there a grocery store that has your heart?</p>
<p id="p-21">Well, okay.</p>
<p id="p-22">So yeah, it's funny.</p>
<p id="p-23">I feel like the ones that have my heart are not the ones that I go to on a daily basis.</p>
<p id="p-24">Yeah, that makes sense.</p>
<p id="p-25">Right?</p>
<p id="p-26">So they're kind of the special ones.</p>
<p id="p-27">They might be a little further away, not right there, because there are always the basic ones, maybe five minutes away.</p>
<p id="p-28">And that's like the everyday ones.</p>
<p id="p-29">But the special ones that have my heart, I would say, are Trader Joe's.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-30">say are Trader Joe's and I do like Costco.</p>
<p id="p-31">What about you?</p>
<p id="p-32">Do you have, are you loyal to any?</p>
<p id="p-33">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-34">Yeah, I, I like Costco a lot.</p>
<p id="p-35">I, I don't go very, I don't have a membership, um, but sometimes I'll sneak in under, you know, like my mother-in-law's membership or something when I get a chance to, but I just, I like to try to walk if I can to my grocery store.</p>
<p id="p-36">So there's a King Soopers just down the, just down the road.</p>
<p id="p-37">So I try to go there, but yeah, Costco, you love it.</p>
<p id="p-38">I get it.</p>
<p id="p-39">I get it because who doesn't? Who doesn't? Who doesn't? Yeah, no, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-40">So today we're going to answer a listener question about Costco.</p>
<p id="p-41">Um, and this comes to us from YouTube, but Lindsay, do you want to read the question for us before we get into it?</p>
<p id="p-42">Yeah, This question comes from Hamza Larifi 7092 and Hamza says, thank you for such an amazing podcast.</p>
<p id="p-43">Could you do one episode on Costco Word?</p>
<p id="p-44">First time I heard it, um, it's not clear to me, so I would love to use it.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-45">to me, so I would love to use it.</p>
<p id="p-46">So, Michelle, we're just assuming this listener is asking about just Costco, and we're going to talk a lot about the Costco effect, talk a lot about this global phenomenon of Costco, right?</p>
<p id="p-47">And what it means in American culture versus, you know, I have some observations from living abroad, grocery shopping, how it happens, when it happens, very different around the world.</p>
<p id="p-48">Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p id="p-49">And, and so to this listener, if for some reason you were intending to ask a different question, please feel free to write to us again.</p>
<p id="p-50">And we'll try to answer that question.</p>
<p id="p-51">But hopefully we got it.</p>
<p id="p-52">And thank you so much for that question.</p>
<p id="p-53">So I actually recently became a Costco member.</p>
<p id="p-54">Congratulations.</p>
<p id="p-55">You'll have that membership for life, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-56">That's right.</p>
<p id="p-57">Yeah, my mom is a huge Costco fan.</p>
<p id="p-58">And she wanted to buy it for my family as part of a housewarming gift.</p>
<p id="p-59">Oh, that's cute.</p>
<p id="p-60">That's nice.</p>
<p id="p-61">Yeah, </p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-62">That's nice.</p>
<p id="p-63">Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, So I was telling I was telling Lindsay before the episode that my mom really loves Costco.</p>
<p id="p-64">I mean, and I mean, you know, there are people who really, really love there.</p>
<p id="p-65">Oh, yeah, you have pretty people.</p>
<p id="p-66">If you Costco is not something where you just Oh, yeah, I yeah, I like it.</p>
<p id="p-67">Oh, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-68">You don't. You also don't casually wander into Costco because it's usually like in a kind of rural suburban area drawn out you have to drive you have to take a big car to fill it up.</p>
<p id="p-69">It's not.</p>
<p id="p-70">It's not just a window shopping thing.</p>
<p id="p-71">Oh, I happened to stumble into Costco picked up by things.</p>
<p id="p-72">No, no, it's a commitment.</p>
<p id="p-73">You probably strategize around what time you go.</p>
<p id="p-74">It's so true.</p>
<p id="p-75">And it's that's why it's so different than like, I go to shop, right?</p>
<p id="p-76">Okay, I had to pick up milk and a few things.</p>
<p id="p-77">Costco is you're not going to just go to Costco to to pick up some milk.</p>
<p id="p-78">Yes, 100%. I mean, unless you live next to the Costco, I guess.</p>
<p id="p-79">But most people don't live next to the Costco.</p>
<p id="p-80">And I love that Hamza asked this question.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-81">And I love that Hamza asked this question because you're right, Michelle, it is a huge connection topic in so many ways.</p>
<p id="p-82">Yes, it's just a grocery store, but it's so much more than that because you have already in this episode shared your mom's thoughts on Costco, which brings up your own memories of childhood and your current exchanges with your mom now.</p>
<p id="p-83">I mean, she's gifting your family this.</p>
<p id="p-84">It's a big deal.</p>
<p id="p-85">Yeah, it's true.</p>
<p id="p-86">This is definitely a huge, huge connection topic.</p>
<p id="p-87">And I was telling Lindsay that my mom, even to this day, whenever you ask her, if you say, Mom, I love this, she'll say, Oh, Costco, honey, meaning like I got it there.</p>
<p id="p-88">And so I was telling Lindsay that she always says Costco, honey.</p>
<p id="p-89">And so my nephew thought for the longest time that it was actually the name of the store was Costco, honey.</p>
<p id="p-90">Well, that's a good name, I suppose.</p>
<p id="p-91">Costco, honey, or maybe if you got honey at Costco, then yeah, that's hilarious.</p>
<p id="p-92">That is so funny.</p>
<p id="p-93">Oh my God.</p>
<p id="p-94">So what's the big thing?</p>
<p id="p-95">Let's get to the heart of it.</p>
<p id="p-96">We know we've looked this up a bit.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-97">We know, we've looked this up a bit.</p>
<p id="p-98">Michelle, you did a little research.</p>
<p id="p-99">It looks like Costco's all over the world.</p>
<p id="p-100">So we feel pretty confident that you all are going to resonate with this.</p>
<p id="p-101">But what is the big thing that's different about Costco versus the grocery store down the street?</p>
<p id="p-102">Like, what's the point of Costco?</p>
<p id="p-103">Right, to buy in bulk, right?</p>
<p id="p-104">And I think we've talked about in bulk in the past, but we're going to mention it today.</p>
<p id="p-105">So in bulk, what does that mean?</p>
<p id="p-106">In bulk, yeah, it's a great one to know here.</p>
<p id="p-107">It means in large quantities.</p>
<p id="p-108">So again, instead of buying one thing of soap, you would buy a bundle of 17 soaps until next Christmas, right?</p>
<p id="p-109">Right, So yeah, it's a buying in bulk thing.</p>
<p id="p-110">And the idea is to get things cheaper per unit.</p>
<p id="p-111">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-112">It's a pretty big cultural phenomenon.</p>
<p id="p-113">And people have pretty strong feelings about Costco, I think.</p>
<p id="p-114">I think it was even on an episode of Seinfeld once.</p>
<p id="p-115">It makes its way.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-116">once.</p>
<p id="p-117">It makes its way into pop culture.</p>
<p id="p-118">It's a big deal.</p>
<p id="p-119">But, Lindsay, you also wanted to talk about something called the Costco effect.</p>
<p id="p-120">So tell us about that.</p>
<p id="p-121">Yeah, I think this is out in the zeitgeist of our culture that people mention this, the idea that maybe you go and you say, I'm just going to, maybe some people will go to get one thing, but they buy it in bulk and then they come out with a whole shopping cart full of stuff.</p>
<p id="p-122">It's just the idea that things are cheap.</p>
<p id="p-123">Things are cheap, so we buy more of it even if we didn't necessarily need it.</p>
<p id="p-124">So the key here is that you need a big house to be able to store all these things.</p>
<p id="p-125">So this works better in more suburban areas and rural areas than in the city because just not having enough storage to be able to store things.</p>
<p id="p-126">And also, I want to talk a little bit, Michelle, about grocery shopping habits.</p>
<p id="p-127">I mean, how often do you grocery shop in American culture?</p>
<p id="p-128">Great question.</p>
<p id="p-129">Yeah, So I just moved, you know, and I used to live...</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-130">you know, and I used to live, this has been one of the hardest adjustments.</p>
<p id="p-131">I used to live right next door to the grocery shop.</p>
<p id="p-132">So just even at 10 o'clock at night, if I needed something, I'll just run over.</p>
<p id="p-133">Yeah, So, but it's interesting, the closer you live, the more frequently you go.</p>
<p id="p-134">So you might just shop for that night, you might just shop for exactly, yeah, you know, a couple days at a time.</p>
<p id="p-135">Now that I mean, the grocery store is a five minute drive away.</p>
<p id="p-136">So yesterday I popped in, um, I just needed a few things.</p>
<p id="p-137">Um, so I would say, I would say once to twice a week I'm in the grocery store.</p>
<p id="p-138">I'm it's, I'm not doing like, it's not, it's still fairly frequently, but not, I used to just go in there all the time, all the time.</p>
<p id="p-139">Part of your night, right?</p>
<p id="p-140">Part of the evening.</p>
<p id="p-141">Yeah, Yeah, So I have to be a little bit more thoughtful about it.</p>
<p id="p-142">Not too much.</p>
<p id="p-143">It's not like it's an hour away or anything, but a little bit more thoughtful about it.</p>
<p id="p-144">What about you, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-145">How often do you go?</p>
<p id="p-146">Yeah, similar thing.</p>
<p id="p-147">So.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-148">How often do you go?</p>
<p id="p-149">Yeah, similar thing.</p>
<p id="p-150">So we go on Sundays.</p>
<p id="p-151">We do a big trip on Sundays, which is what I did when I was growing up, which I think is kind of the typical American layout.</p>
<p id="p-152">Most people go to the grocery shop and fill up your cart once a week.</p>
<p id="p-153">And then we'll also, you know, if we need something, we'll walk, go to the one locally down the street.</p>
<p id="p-154">So we'll drive to the one on Sundays and then walk to the ones, you know, in the evening if we want to add something to dinner or something like that.</p>
<p id="p-155">But the reason I'm asking this, Michelle, is when I lived in Japan and when I lived in Paris, I noticed that things were really different.</p>
<p id="p-156">The grocery shopping seemed to be happening pretty much every evening when people are getting off the train because the grocery store was a smaller shop in between the train station and people's apartments.</p>
<p id="p-157">So what does this mean?</p>
<p id="p-158">Getting fresher food, right, is really interesting.</p>
<p id="p-159">Yeah, Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-160">Yeah, I think there's maybe more of an emphasis on freshness.</p>
<p id="p-161">Freshness.</p>
<p id="p-162">Yes, And, well, like for me, I mean, yesterday, for example, I bought...</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-163">um, I bought, uh, salmon at the grocery store and it was, you know, then Dan later said, Oh, should we go out to dinner?</p>
<p id="p-164">I said, no, I have Sam because once I waited, I got salmon.</p>
<p id="p-165">And then by the next day I said, okay, we'll have it in like a day or two.</p>
<p id="p-166">And it was already spoiled.</p>
<p id="p-167">And so I guess I have this idea in my head with salmon that if you get it, like you have to have, yeah, kind of, I agree with that.</p>
<p id="p-168">Actually.</p>
<p id="p-169">Yeah, Seven is like an immediate, we're having it tonight.</p>
<p id="p-170">Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, So I think Costco makes sense in American culture.</p>
<p id="p-171">I mean, we, yeah, we're shopping once a week and, but I do kind of wish that we had more of a, a culture of shopping daily.</p>
<p id="p-172">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-173">I, I don't, I mean, it is what it is.</p>
<p id="p-174">It depends where you live.</p>
<p id="p-175">Yeah, Maybe if you're in a more urban environment, like you were saying, you would go and grab stuff every night.</p>
<p id="p-176">Um, maybe that happens more in an urban environment, right?</p>
<p id="p-177">Yeah, Yeah, Um, but yeah.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-178">But, yeah, I mean, so I was curious about if Costco is popular in all in other parts of the world.</p>
<p id="p-179">So AI gave me some results.</p>
<p id="p-180">So it looks like so the US and Puerto Rico 614 warehouses.</p>
<p id="p-181">Wow.</p>
<p id="p-182">Yeah, So there are Costco's in Canada, Mexico, Japan, the UK, South Korea, Australia and Taiwan.</p>
<p id="p-183">See, it's interesting that we're so even in Japan, where I was mentioning where I observed a lot of small, tiny grocery stores, there's still space for a Costco effect like a Costco type of store for bulk buying, even though the apartments are very small.</p>
<p id="p-184">So I'm curious about that, actually.</p>
<p id="p-185">Maybe we'll have to put this into a poll question today somehow.</p>
<p id="p-186">Mm hmm.</p>
<p id="p-187">Yeah, that's a good idea.</p>
<p id="p-188">So anyway, the listener is asking about Costco.</p>
<p id="p-189">So we're going to give some words we already started a little bit.</p>
<p id="p-190">So we did in bulk.</p>
<p id="p-191">So I like to shop in bulk so I don't have to do shopping.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-192">in bulk so I don't have to do shopping more than once every three weeks.</p>
<p id="p-193">Wow, that would be amazing.</p>
<p id="p-194">I just don't know how that's possible because you have to get fresh things like milk.</p>
<p id="p-195">Right, I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-196">Maybe, but this person is really living on the edge.</p>
<p id="p-197">And people do this now too on Amazon.</p>
<p id="p-198">It will be interesting to see how Costco does.</p>
<p id="p-199">Amazon also does a lot of people buy in bulk on Amazon, right?</p>
<p id="p-200">Buy 17 soaps instead of, you know, like I said, samples are another thing about Costco that's actually so important that we have to mention.</p>
<p id="p-201">Michelle, what about?</p>
<p id="p-202">Yes, so Costco is famous for its samples.</p>
<p id="p-203">So, I mean, yesterday I was at ShopRite and they had one little table of samples and it was just like, oh, a Costco wannabe.</p>
<p id="p-204">And sometimes you'll see even Trader Joe's does samples, but nobody like does samples like Costco.</p>
<p id="p-205">They all around the store, they have counters with samples to give out.</p>
<p id="p-206">And it's like, I mean, you can get like the other...</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-207">you can get like the other time I was there, there was like spaghetti and sauce.</p>
<p id="p-208">I mean, it's real, it's good stuff.</p>
<p id="p-209">They do everything big, let's say, right?</p>
<p id="p-210">Yes, yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-211">So that's always an exciting part.</p>
<p id="p-212">I mean, you can go over there and you can basically have a whole lunch on samples.</p>
<p id="p-213">It's true.</p>
<p id="p-214">And I think people probably do.</p>
<p id="p-215">Here's a sample sentence.</p>
<p id="p-216">So I'm heading over to that end for the samples.</p>
<p id="p-217">I'll catch you later.</p>
<p id="p-218">Yeah, So when people talk about Costco, they're talking about kind of an experience, right?</p>
<p id="p-219">It's not a regular, yeah, it's not a regular, I'm going to go to my, my whatever, no name grocery store.</p>
<p id="p-220">It's Costco.</p>
<p id="p-221">It's a big deal in our culture.</p>
<p id="p-222">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-223">The samples, the bulk buying, the deals you're getting, how big your cart gets.</p>
<p id="p-224">I mean, how much you have in your car when you come home, it's a big deal, right?</p>
<p id="p-225">It's an event.</p>
<p id="p-226">Or then you could say great deal because they do have some good prices.</p>
<p id="p-227">So you could say, I got the greatest deal on yogurt.</p>
<p id="p-228">I mean, I'm sure they have great prices, right?</p>
<p id="p-229">Because if you're buying</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-230">sure they have great prices, right?</p>
<p id="p-231">Because if you're buying so many of these things, it has to be a good price.</p>
<p id="p-232">Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-233">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-234">But you do need a membership, right?</p>
<p id="p-235">So that's our next keyword.</p>
<p id="p-236">I think our listeners know it, but here's a sample sentence.</p>
<p id="p-237">I'm definitely going to renew my membership this year.</p>
<p id="p-238">So I don't know what it costs for a Costco membership these days, but it's probably worth it if you go every week and save a ton of money, right?</p>
<p id="p-239">Right, right.</p>
<p id="p-240">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-241">And then they have different plans.</p>
<p id="p-242">Of course, we got the basic and then we upgraded because we realized that financially, it actually made sense to get the more expensive plan.</p>
<p id="p-243">It's funny how that works out.</p>
<p id="p-244">Yeah, And then I thought I would teach big box store.</p>
<p id="p-245">Would you say Costco is a big box store?</p>
<p id="p-246">Yeah, I think it is.</p>
<p id="p-247">What is a big box store, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-248">Let's define that first.</p>
<p id="p-249">To me, big box store is like a Walmart.</p>
<p id="p-250">You know, just like the here, let's look it up officially.</p>
<p id="p-251">Yeah, I looked it up.</p>
<p id="p-252">And according to investopedia.com, the first one they list.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-253">to investopedia.com.</p>
<p id="p-254">The first one they list is Walmart, Home Depot, Tesco, Ikea, and then it says Target.</p>
<p id="p-255">Tesco and BJ's are the original.</p>
<p id="p-256">Oh, interesting.</p>
<p id="p-257">So the idea is low prices.</p>
<p id="p-258">Yeah, So this is investopedia.com.</p>
<p id="p-259">Large, large inventory, like pretty much everything you need, you could get at a big box store, low prices, but usually always a franchise.</p>
<p id="p-260">Not much character most of the time, although Tesco, you could argue, does have that character as we're talking about, just because it's such a phenomenon.</p>
<p id="p-261">So I know big box stores aren't charming, but they can be a lot of fun if you don't get overwhelmed.</p>
<p id="p-262">Do you get overwhelmed when you go to a place like Target or Walmart or something, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-263">Yes, I do.</p>
<p id="p-264">I'm very overwhelmed.</p>
<p id="p-265">I can only do a little bit.</p>
<p id="p-266">I mean, yeah, it's a lot for me.</p>
<p id="p-267">What about you?</p>
<p id="p-268">It's crowded and it's hard for me to make a decision and things like that.</p>
<p id="p-269">Yeah, it depends on my mood.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-270">a decision and things like that.</p>
<p id="p-271">Yeah, it depends on my mood when I go in.</p>
<p id="p-272">Usually I know what I need and if I can't find it right away, I get annoyed.</p>
<p id="p-273">So I start trying to figure out, read the signs, like where do I go?</p>
<p id="p-274">I just need a Tupperware and where's the Tupperware?</p>
<p id="p-275">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-276">Yeah, that can get frustrating.</p>
<p id="p-277">But yeah, I've had it.</p>
<p id="p-278">I mean, just as far as a connection topic, this is huge because, I mean, just a couple of weeks ago, I was at the park and I was talking to my son's friend's dad.</p>
<p id="p-279">I mean, all about Costco.</p>
<p id="p-280">He was going on and on and we were just having so much fun in our conversation.</p>
<p id="p-281">So this is just, it really is something people talk about.</p>
<p id="p-282">It really is.</p>
<p id="p-283">And I'm super curious if that's, as we've said, Costco is global, but is it such a hot topic globally or is it more of an, like, Americans like it because we get the deal and we like to buy things in bulk?</p>
<p id="p-284">I'm really, really curious.</p>
<p id="p-285">So I think maybe that will be our poll question today, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-286">Yeah, Is Costco a connection topic in your culture or-</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-287">In your culture or is something is there something else that would that that does that for you?</p>
<p id="p-288">Yeah, another type of shopping experience.</p>
<p id="p-289">Let's go into a roleplay Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-290">Let's do it.</p>
<p id="p-291">So Lindsay We are at Costco.</p>
<p id="p-292">So of course get into the Costco spirit.</p>
<p id="p-293">Okay, so we're friends who run into each other at Costco All right.</p>
<p id="p-294">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-295">Here we go Hey, Lindsay, good to see you.</p>
<p id="p-296">Hey, I didn't know you had a Costco membership.</p>
<p id="p-297">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-298">I just got it.</p>
<p id="p-299">Love it so far Oh me too.</p>
<p id="p-300">Let's walk over there and get some samples.</p>
<p id="p-301">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-302">Yeah, I started coming here because now with my family I need to shop in bulk perfect place to do it and you get great deals here.</p>
<p id="p-303">Yes I love it more than other big-box stores.</p>

<p id="p-314">It's like, you can get a bottle of water for 25 cents.</p>
<p id="p-315">Yeah, and I think this is especially relevant now.</p>
<p id="p-316">We've just been through a rollercoaster of inflation, right?</p>
<p id="p-317">Inflation was as high as 9% in the US and higher around the world, we know that.</p>
<p id="p-318">And so it becomes even more relevant, this kind of cost savings to people, right?</p>
<p id="p-319">Those prices aren't going back down, but if we can make sure they don't go up as much, we can enjoy still buying further in bulk and saving even more, yeah?</p>
<p id="p-320">Yeah, Love that.</p>
<p id="p-321">Yeah, love that.</p>
