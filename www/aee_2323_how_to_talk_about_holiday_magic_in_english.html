<p>Warning.</p>
<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p>Warning, this episode is not for younger listeners, because today, we answer a listener question about how parents can keep holiday magic alive.</p>
<p>Hello, Aubrey.</p>
<p>Are you excited about the holidays coming up soon?</p>
<p>I am so excited about the holidays.</p>
<p>I know not everyone out there celebrates Christmas, but there may be some type of holiday you're celebrating soon.</p>
<p>It's fun just to get into the holidays.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>it's fun just to get into the holiday spirit.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm really excited.</p>
<p>Yeah, just to maybe see family a bit more, maybe just work a little less or slow down, take some days off and just relax.</p>
<p>I am super excited.</p>
<p>So this is a family time, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is what we're getting into today.</p>
<p>But we do have a really, really, really important caveat for any of our listeners that happen to be listening today with their children.</p>
<p>What is it, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yes, So some of you have let us know that you listen with your children, which we love.</p>
<p>That is awesome.</p>
<p>We are going to be talking about Christmas magic and Santa Claus today.</p>
<p>And it's a message that you might not want very young children to hear.</p>
<p>So just a heads up, you may not want to listen to this episode with young children.</p>
<p>Yeah, but we have 2000 plus other episodes.</p>
<p>So if you're in that moment where you think you want to turn it off right now, go back to our other episodes, so many options for you.</p>
<p>And then come back and listen later without the kids, because this is going to be a great episode.</p>
<p>We don't want you to miss it.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>don't want you to miss it.</p>
<p>But we also, not appropriate for little ears.</p>
<p>Kaitlin Luna, Ph.D. Exactly.</p>
<p>Well, let's get into it.</p>
<p>Let's ask the big question, Aubrey.</p>
<p>Can I ask you?</p>
<p>Kaitlin Luna, Ph.D. Well, let me ask you.</p>
<p>Because my, well, we'll both answer this.</p>
<p>I'm going to ask you first, Lindsay.</p>
<p>How did you find out that Santa wasn't real?</p>
<p>Kaitlin Luna, Ph.D. Yeah, I just remember having a conversation with my mom.</p>
<p>I think I would, maybe I was a little on the older side.</p>
<p>I think usually first children tend to learn later, right?</p>
<p>I think I was about, like, nine.</p>
<p>And I sort of, you know, started to question, I started to ask the more pointed questions.</p>
<p>Well, how does this work?</p>
<p>How exactly does he get down the chimney?</p>
<p>And how can he possibly go to all the houses in the whole world?</p>
<p>And my mom started saying things like, well, what do you think?</p>
<p>Like, not in a rude way, kind of more, she didn't want to say it, you know?</p>
<p>She wanted to kind of facilitate a space for me, but not tell me the true answer.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>the true answer.</p>
<p>What about you, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Were you like three?</p>
<p>It sounds like your mom handled it really well.</p>
<p>No, I have never had a conversation with my parents about Santa not being real.</p>
<p>I was in high school, college, Santa was still bringing presents.</p>
<p>It's like at some point I just knew, but we just never had a conversation.</p>
<p>I never asked.</p>
<p>It was like, don't ask, don't tell.</p>
<p>If you believe, he will keep bringing you presents.</p>
<p>We just never talked about it.</p>
<p>That is so interesting.</p>
<p>We all have our own unique experience.</p>
<p>I mean, I know for sure if you're a middle child or a third child, you probably learn earlier usually, but in some cases things aren't talked about in households too, right?</p>
<p>And it depends on the child.</p>
<p>So I'm going to share sort of what's happened with some of my kids.</p>
<p>But first we want to share this amazing question we got that inspired this episode.</p>
<p>Lindsay, can you read this question for us?</p>
<p>All right, here we go.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And just one more caveat, if any of our listeners have joined in recently before we did our last caveat.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>recently before we did our last caveat.</p>
<p>If you're listening with a young child, maybe listen to another episode today.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And then come back on your own to listen in.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Hello, everyone.</p>
<p>I'm Mai from Japan.</p>
<p>I enjoy listening to your podcast and the stories of each host every day.</p>
<p>I have a question.</p>
<p>I'm very curious how children in the US who believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy eventually end up.</p>
<p>I have a nine-year-old daughter who recently asked, does Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy really exist?</p>
<p>It is so adorable to watch my daughter believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy, but I honestly don't know how to answer the question.</p>
<p>This is not a question about English, but if you could introduce my question on your podcast, could you tell me your experience or any heartwarming story if you have one?</p>
<p>Oh, that is beautiful.</p>
<p>It's an amazing question.</p>
<p>And it is about English, right?</p>
<p>Because a lot of you are teaching your children to be bilingual, or you have immigrated somewhere where your kids are starting to create their own traditions, your</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>create their own traditions, you're creating your own family traditions in an English-speaking country and you do need to know, how do I say this?</p>
<p>What are the phrases I would use?</p>
<p>What are my kids learning at school?</p>
<p>It's interesting.</p>
<p>There's a lot to think about.</p>
<p>Oh, 100%. And thank you to Mai for asking this question.</p>
<p>It's a great question.</p>
<p>Before we do get into it, I want to request for our listeners to hit that follow button because we're looking at 2025 and we have options.</p>
<p>I know for me, the podcast that I actually follow are the ones that drop into my queue and those are the ones I end up listening to, right?</p>
<p>I don't go searching for others very often.</p>
<p>Same.</p>
<p>Yeah, So that's the way to make English a habit and to learn the right values, what we think are the right values around English, which is connection, not perfection.</p>
<p>Human connection, okay?</p>
<p>Hit follow.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>So hit that follow button, everyone.</p>
<p>We love it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I have been asked this question because I have four children and I think I have a good answer.</p>
<p>So I'm excited to share.</p>
<p>I want you guys to stay to the end to hear a couple of different answers.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>the end to hear a couple of different answers because kids are very different.</p>
<p>And each parent knows this.</p>
<p>If you have more than one child, it's going to work differently.</p>
<p>They're going to need maybe a little different answer.</p>
<p>But first, I think it's interesting to think about this isn't just about Christmas, right?</p>
<p>There are a lot of things where parents tell little white lies to their children.</p>
<p>We have Elf on the Shelf, which is supposedly a real elf that goes to Santa and it moves every night.</p>
<p>And this is kind of a little white lie.</p>
<p>And then the Tooth Fairy, Mai pointed out as well, a lot of parents hide... The children hide their teeth under the pillow, and then it disappears and there's money.</p>
<p>And the Tooth Fairy has replaced the tooth.</p>
<p>So there are kind of a lot of lies that we tell children, right, Lindsay?</p>
<p>Yeah, Elf on the Shelf, I think, must be new because my niece... Oh, sorry.</p>
<p>My niece does that.</p>
<p>Or she did.</p>
<p>I think she's past that age by now.</p>
<p>But this must be new because we definitely didn't have Elf on the Shelf.</p>
<p>It's newer.</p>
<p>It comes with a book that came out maybe 10 or 15 years ago.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It's been a little while.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>ago.</p>
<p>It's been a little while, but newer than when we were little.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>And so there's a little stuffed animal elf that you're supposed to bring out or shows up on December 1st, and then keeps an eye on the kids to make sure they're good, which is kind of creepy.</p>
<p>Creepy.</p>
<p>And then moves every morning is in a different spot.</p>
<p>Our kids have loved looking for the elf every morning to find out where she has ended up.</p>
<p>And it's really hard to remember to move her.</p>
<p>It's hilarious.</p>
<p>They love it.</p>
<p>But that's the first thing I thought too, creepy.</p>
<p>Kind of creepy.</p>
<p>And one more job for parents to have to do.</p>
<p>I have to set an alarm in my phone for both the Tooth Fairy and the Elf on the Shelf to remember these things.</p>
<p>Yes, Oh, wow.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>So what do we want our listener, Mai, and the rest of our listeners to know then?</p>
<p>Do we go ahead and answer this question?</p>
<p>Yeah, So her actual question was, children who are told these things and who believe these things, like parents telling them, how did these kids end up?</p>
<p>So I think the question is kind of like, does this affect a person to have their parents lie to them?</p>
<p>And so I researched that a little bit.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>And so I researched that a little bit.</p>
<p>We're going to talk about this a little bit.</p>
<p>What factors should you consider when you are telling these little white lives?</p>
<p>Like what are the possible consequences?</p>
<p>Yeah, it makes me think of, what is it, Miracle on 34th Street, where, do you remember that movie where the girl was always told that he didn't exist?</p>
<p>And that was just the parents' parenting style, and then some magical things happened in the movie, right?</p>
<p>Do you remember that?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, vaguely, but yeah, same kind of thing.</p>
<p>And almost every Christmas movie does this really well, where it's like, if people believe, then Christmas magic exists, right?</p>
<p>But it's interesting, at least in the US, most parents do promote the myth of Santa Claus, right?</p>
<p>Most children accept it as real.</p>
<p>You found out at about nine.</p>
<p>My twins are 10 and still believe in Santa Claus, but they are right there where you were.</p>
<p>They're starting to ask questions.</p>
<p>They're starting to hear other kids at school talk about it not being true.</p>
<p>So it's interesting.</p>
<p>Some families never openly talk about whether Santa is real or not.</p>
<p>Mine didn't. And some families tell their children.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>and some families tell their children quite early.</p>
<p>So then it becomes tricky because the kids at school, some of them are like, you know, mocking other students for believing.</p>
<p>That's too bad.</p>
<p>And I think especially if, like I said earlier, if you're an oldest child, you probably will believe longer because they want to keep it going for your brother or sister, because generally I think siblings would tell each other and then if you're the younger one, it gets ruined pretty young.</p>
<p>Right, yeah, no, we don't want that.</p>
<p>Yeah, But we're going to quickly go into a few of the things.</p>
<p>I researched a little bit online.</p>
<p>Just the sort of the things to consider when you're deciding, should I tell my children this is not true?</p>
<p>Like when, can I be, how, you know, what age?</p>
<p>So first is to consider the developmental stage.</p>
<p>And what I found was basically children are able to distinguish fact from fiction in very early childhood.</p>
<p>And that this is going to be a very personal thing for each child.</p>
<p>If your child has a reason to have trust issues, if they're questioning whether it's real or not, if they're saying, just tell me, kids at school are telling me like, then you're going to want to follow your own instincts, but it might be time.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>You want to follow your own instincts, but it might be time to just be honest like your parents were, Lindsay.</p>
<p>And maybe like your mom did, instead of outright saying, okay, Santa's not real.</p>
<p>She wanted me to come to the conclusion.</p>
<p>My mom actually was a child psychologist, so she was a child developmental psychologist, so maybe that's where that came from.</p>
<p>So give her a little credit for sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can see that.</p>
<p>And she probably knew that.</p>
<p>Number two here is you want to think about how it could affect a relationship.</p>
<p>So for me, and allowing my children to still believe Santa exists, there is no effect to the relationship, right?</p>
<p>It's not something where it's creating this potential loss of trust, right?</p>
<p>We are building trust together, and it will be, once my kids find out, it will be something that they'll see it as like, oh, mom and dad did this in order to make Christmas magical and fun, rather than like, they were trying to deceive us.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Now that is so important for them to come away with the right message.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>important for them to come away with the right message, right?</p>
<p>Right, Yeah, It's tricky.</p>
<p>Yeah, And then the impact of the child.</p>
<p>What do we need to know here?</p>
<p>Yeah, So this is where we get... There are a lot of different opinions, both among child psychologists, among parents.</p>
<p>Some will definitely say that any lying encourages children to be dishonest and think dishonesty is acceptable.</p>
<p>Others will say you can help them see the magic of Christmas as different, as a way to be creative and just to believe in the impossible, right?</p>
<p>And that that's a net positive.</p>
<p>Yeah, Because later in life, some aspects in life do feel magical.</p>
<p>Aspects of reality can feel very magical in life.</p>
<p>So maybe this is just warming them up to the magic that does exist in life.</p>
<p>If we look for it, you know?</p>
<p>Exactly, right?</p>
<p>If you believe that nothing difficult is possible, then your whole life, maybe you won't try things at work or in life that could have led to great results.</p>
<p>Right, Or even just, you know, looking at just a sunset.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>Or even just, you know, looking at just a sunset as magical or childbirth, like the fact that children are born every day is actually magical, right?</p>
<p>There's some true miracles that happen.</p>
<p>It's not literally magical, but it feels like a miracle, you know, feels, you know, you can, you'll get more joy sort of if you allow it to feel sort of magical, those types of things.</p>
<p>So maybe we're trying to foster a sense of awe, right?</p>
<p>How to inspire awe in children and how to look for it, which is really a foundation of a happy life, I think.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And this leads to number four, which is when it's all about creating traditions, if you do build traditions around Elf on the Shelf or Santa Claus or whatever myths you might have in your culture, maybe there are little white lies that you tell children, children are told in your culture.</p>
<p>If it is about creating memories and family traditions, then that probably will be a net positive.</p>
<p>And one day, once your kids know the truth behind all these myths, because there are tall tales and myths, like think of the Vikings or, you know, a lot of things around all of these traditions that not everything's.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>all of these traditions that not everything's 100% true.</p>
<p>If in the end, the goal is to create tradition, then it should be positive.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe.</p>
<p>And we're doing a lot of other things tradition-wise other than just stuff around Santa Claus, right?</p>
<p>Going to get the tree.</p>
<p>If you do celebrate Christmas, if it's another tradition that you celebrate, there could be other rituals, right?</p>
<p>But we can build this in 100%. Okay, Aubrey.</p>
<p>So do you have a specific answer here for Mai?</p>
<p>Do you want to directly answer?</p>
<p>I wanted to share.</p>
<p>So I kind of understand how you feel, Mai.</p>
<p>It's like, I don't know how to answer this question.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what the right answer is.</p>
<p>And for each child, it's going to be different.</p>
<p>I think you'll want to kind of consider everything we've talked about today.</p>
<p>But I found, when my kids ask, I've said, you know, Santa Claus is part of the magic of Christmas, and Christmas magic can only exist if you believe in it.</p>
<p>And so this fits well with what kids hear in a lot of Christmas movies.</p>
<p>It also works for the Tooth Fairy.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>movies.</p>
<p>It also works for the Tooth Fairy to say, you know, the Tooth Fairy only has magic if you believe in her.</p>
<p>And then you're not actually lying.</p>
<p>And the children as they get older, like my twins now, it's like I tell them that and you can kind of see something click where they're like, I am choosing to believe because Christmas is more fun if I believe and it's magical.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So I'm not saying, yes, it exists.</p>
<p>No, it doesn't exist.</p>
<p>I'm like, it's only magical if you believe.</p>
<p>Oh, smart.</p>
<p>It's a smart answer.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Yeah, And this recently happened to with my son who he has a wiggly tooth and he said, I know the Tooth Fairy isn't real.</p>
<p>Some, you know, a kid at school told me that and same thing.</p>
<p>I said, well, it only, you know, the, the Tooth Fairy won't bring you teeth if you don't believe in her or won't bring you money if you don't believe in her.</p>
<p>Right, And he's like, just kidding.</p>
<p>I believe.</p>
<p>So if you want that magic to continue, you can, but it needs to sort of be like understood by both of you.</p>
<p>That's like, this is magic that we all choose to believe or say we believe in order to keep the, some of the fun.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>in order to keep some of the fun in Christmas, right?</p>
<p>Oh, that's so fun.</p>
<p>I'm curious for our listeners.</p>
<p>We have the Tooth Fairy.</p>
<p>I guess the Easter Bunny sort of was a thing at some point.</p>
<p>Still, absolutely.</p>
<p>It still is for us.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Health on the Shelf and then Santa.</p>
<p>But what do people have in other cultures too?</p>
<p>I'm just curious.</p>
<p>There must be lots of other things that we could learn about.</p>
<p>Guys, leave a comment on this episode on YouTube or on Spotify and let us know what traditions you have.</p>
<p>Super interesting.</p>
<p>I want to know about all of those traditions.</p>
<p>We're going to have to do something in one of our live speaking events to find out.</p>
<p>I think of, I don't know if you ever saw Darby O'Gill and the Little People.</p>
<p>It was about like leprechauns and banshees and in Ireland, some of their myths and traditions.</p>
<p>And I would love to know in every culture, yeah, what are these myths and what are some of the little white lies that you tell kids to keep things magical?</p>
<p>Yeah, such a wonderful question from our listener.</p>
<p>Is there another episode where we could continue on with the holiday magic here, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yes, you guys.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p>here, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yes, you guys don't miss episode 1907 right here on the All Ears English podcast was Three Ways the Holiday Spirit Can Create Connection in English.</p>
<p>So go check that one out as we enter the holidays.</p>
<p>Whether you celebrate Christmas or not, whatever holiday you celebrate, you can connect in English about these celebrations.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think a takeaway thought for our listeners who maybe aren't parents and don't think about this dynamic is what is your relationship the world to awe, right?</p>
<p>Do you have that sense of awe?</p>
<p>Do you take a moment in your daily life to watch the sun?</p>
<p>Like this morning when I was just getting out of bed, the sky was totally pink and I looked at it for a minute.</p>
<p>I was like, wow, that is awesome.</p>
<p>It's such a daily thing, a normal thing, but there's magic in everyday life and I feel like we can really truly be present and happier if we pay attention to those things.</p>
<p>So ask yourself that question.</p>
<p>How many times a day are you kind of just watching things in awe, just watching the world unfold in that way?</p>
<p>Right, I love that as a takeaway.</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p>Right, I love that as a takeaway.</p>
<p>Yes, that is so true for all of us.</p>
<p>If we're not noticing and experiencing awe, we're missing some very magical moments.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>Notice.</p>
<p>Notice those things.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Great stuff.</p>
<p>Thanks for bringing this question to Mai.</p>
<p>And thanks for answering it, Aubrey.</p>
<p>It's a good one.</p>
<p>Really important.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Thanks, Lindsay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Take care.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
