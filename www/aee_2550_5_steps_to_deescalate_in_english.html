<p id="p-13">Hey, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-14">How's it going?</p>
<p id="p-15">I'm great, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-16">How are you doing?</p>
<p id="p-17">Good.</p>
<p id="p-18">Aubrey, have you ever been around someone that was really riled up and you had to de-escalate the situation?</p>
<p id="p-19">Has that ever happened to you?</p>
<p id="p-20">Yes, I feel like I've told this story here about when I was at an airport and someone was really mad that my friend had been peeling the paint on the window.</p>
<p id="p-21">And I think I did.</p>
<p id="p-22">I sort of used a couple of phrases to try and de-escalate, to try and get, she's still with the security had to come over.</p>
<p id="p-23">It was a whole issue, but...</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-24">It was a whole issue, but it doesn't happen very often, but every now and then someone can get really angry.</p>
<p id="p-25">Well, I would also say airports are a hot button place for that.</p>
<p id="p-26">People are at flights delayed or canceled.</p>
<p id="p-27">They're upset about other things and maybe taking it out on someone else.</p>
<p id="p-28">Yeah, you have to be really careful in airports, especially, or boarding a plane, you know, putting your suitcase up there and it's just, Oh my God.</p>
<p id="p-29">These days people just go off, right?</p>
<p id="p-30">They just go off.</p>
<p id="p-31">But today's episode is all about this.</p>
<p id="p-32">You know, how can we de-escalate the temperature, right?</p>
<p id="p-33">And this comes from a question from Makoto, right?</p>
<p id="p-34">A situation that our student Makoto was in.</p>
<p id="p-35">Aubrey, can you tell us about this?</p>
<p id="p-36">Yes, so this was really interesting.</p>
<p id="p-37">He asked about this at Open Conversation Club.</p>
<p id="p-38">He is a basketball referee, and he was saying he has difficulty knowing what to say when players get really riled up.</p>
<p id="p-39">Like if he calls a foul, they might yell, I didn't touch him.</p>
<p id="p-40">And then often anything a ref could...</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-41">And then often anything a ref could say, they just get more angry or more emotional.</p>
<p id="p-42">So it was interesting, we had a really interesting chat about it and how often referees just have to say, that's the way it is, and walk away.</p>
<p id="p-43">They can't really engage.</p>
<p id="p-44">But for the rest of us in regular life, if this happens and someone's riled up, meaning they're very emotional or angry, we need phrases to de-escalate the situation, whether this is happening at work or in our daily lives.</p>
<p id="p-45">All of us have seen those TikTok videos where someone's getting so angry and everyone just starts filming them.</p>
<p id="p-46">Oh, I hate that.</p>
<p id="p-47">I hate that culture of just filming.</p>
<p id="p-48">Now it, I hate so revolting that everyone just takes their phone and starts filming.</p>
<p id="p-49">It's, ugh, gross.</p>
<p id="p-50">Right?</p>
<p id="p-51">And then someone probably just gets angrier and angrier the more phones they see filming them.</p>
<p id="p-52">Of course, of course, no one wants to be on film, but yeah, but the truth is we can't always just walk away, so we do need these skills.</p>
<p id="p-53">So it's kind of conflict management going on here, right?</p>
<p id="p-54">We can't always just walk away from the situation.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-55">And always just walk away from the situation.</p>
<p id="p-56">So guys, hit the follow button.</p>

<p id="p-60">Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-61">And you're exactly right, Lindsay, that for when you do care about the connection, maybe it's a coworker, a friend or a family member, you don't want to just walk away.</p>
<p id="p-62">You need these strategies to de-escalate.</p>
<p id="p-63">You need the phrases that you could say to try and resolve the issue.</p>
<p id="p-64">Mm-hmm, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-65">So we're putting this into a couple of buckets of things we might want to do.</p>
<p id="p-66">And the first bucket today is acknowledging feelings.</p>
<p id="p-67">Of course, it's not just for children, right?</p>
<p id="p-68">All human beings need to have their feelings acknowledged.</p>
<p id="p-69">Absolutely, right?</p>
<p id="p-70">And it's amazing how that might just immediately calm someone down if they feel like...</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-71">calm someone down if they feel like their feelings are being validated, that someone else understands why they're upset, right?</p>
<p id="p-72">So you might just say something like, I understand that you're upset, and this just validates their emotions without even agreeing necessarily.</p>
<p id="p-73">Mm-hmm.</p>
<p id="p-74">I understand that you're upset, or I understand why you're upset, right?</p>
<p id="p-75">Both would work.</p>
<p id="p-76">Or I can see why you'd feel that way, and we're using the you would, you'd. I can see why you'd feel that way.</p>
<p id="p-77">Mm-hmm.</p>
<p id="p-78">And this shows empathy.</p>
<p id="p-79">It can calm defensiveness or anger, right?</p>
<p id="p-80">Just to have one person acknowledging that they're not crazy, right?</p>
<p id="p-81">That what's they're saying makes sense or is justified.</p>
<p id="p-82">Mm-hmm.</p>
<p id="p-83">Or it sounds like this is important to you, right?</p>
<p id="p-84">So that, yeah, that appeals to the person's values, and it kind of looks past their rage, right?</p>
<p id="p-85">Right, It focuses on validating their perspective rather, you know, rather than the conflict.</p>
<p id="p-86">It sort of takes the focus off the conflict.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-87">Takes the focus off the conflict and puts it on us as people, like I understand your perspective.</p>
<p id="p-88">And I have a feeling if any of our listeners work in really probably anything like customer service or even retail, they may have been trained in some of this, right?</p>
<p id="p-89">Especially nowadays to have these phrases to how to deescalate in a situation where a customer is really upset, right?</p>
<p id="p-90">Especially if you're a supervisor or a manager, because often a lot of employees, like their first step would just be to pull over a supervisor.</p>
<p id="p-91">But if you are, you know, the manager, you need these skills and these phrases to deescalate.</p>
<p id="p-92">Yes, okay, so that's the first bucket.</p>
<p id="p-93">The first bucket again was acknowledging feelings, and then number two, what else should we do?</p>
<p id="p-94">Yeah, number two is to show a willingness to listen.</p>
<p id="p-95">This is where it's interesting because we also, our emotions might be, you know, rising as well.</p>
<p id="p-96">We might be getting impatient or frustrated.</p>
<p id="p-97">And so this is really tricky.</p>
<p id="p-98">Like if we really care about the connection, we will be willing to hear</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-99">about the connection, we will be willing to hear their side, and we wanna show that.</p>
<p id="p-100">So for example, you could say, let's take a moment to talk about this, right?</p>
<p id="p-101">Invite that conversation and try to move away from confrontation.</p>
<p id="p-102">Or help me understand your point of view.</p>
<p id="p-103">This feels very collaborative.</p>
<p id="p-104">It feels quite peaceful when we say this.</p>
<p id="p-105">So you're just encouraging them to share what's going on in their minds in that moment.</p>
<p id="p-106">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-107">Or I want to hear what you're thinking, right?</p>
<p id="p-108">This would definitely signal that you're open to a conversation about it.</p>
<p id="p-109">The tricky thing with these is you can't fake this.</p>
<p id="p-110">Someone will be able to tell if you don't mean it.</p>
<p id="p-111">If you're insincere, you're frustrated, you're impatient, and you're just saying this, right, you really need to truly be willing to listen when you're in this situation where you're trying to de-escalate.</p>
<p id="p-112">Otherwise, it'll just make them more angry, right?</p>
<p id="p-113">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-114">Yeah, I don't think you could even say these phrases if you're also escalating.</p>
<p id="p-115">Sometimes we mirror the person and we escalate in that same way.</p>
<p id="p-116">I don't think you could even say these.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-117">I don't think you could even say these.</p>
<p id="p-118">You know what I mean?</p>
<p id="p-119">That's true.</p>
<p id="p-120">You might need to skip to number four.</p>
<p id="p-121">We'll get there.</p>
<p id="p-122">Because sometimes you need time to cool down before you could use these types of phrases.</p>
<p id="p-123">Yeah, and in the meantime, let's hit number three.</p>
<p id="p-124">Use softening statements.</p>
<p id="p-125">So what does that mean, a softening statement, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-126">Yeah, something that will help reduce defensiveness, invite collaboration, right?</p>
<p id="p-127">So, for example, I might be wrong, but here's how I see it.</p>
<p id="p-128">So instead of going very direct with, you know, this is what I think is the case, right?</p>
<p id="p-129">I'm softening that by saying, like, I could be wrong about this, but have you considered this?</p>
<p id="p-130">This is how I see it.</p>
<p id="p-131">You're softening that.</p>
<p id="p-132">Softening it.</p>
<p id="p-133">And you could also soften by saying, I see your point.</p>
<p id="p-134">Maybe we can find a solution together.</p>
<p id="p-135">Okay?</p>
<p id="p-136">So here we're moving the focus from blame to problem solving.</p>
<p id="p-137">And I like that.</p>
<p id="p-138">I like that orientation of, hey, let's figure this out together.</p>
<p id="p-139">Okay?</p>
<p id="p-140">Exactly, because imagine if you stay in blame, if everyone's just blaming and getting, then it escalates.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-141">One's just blaming and getting then it escalates, escalates, right?</p>
<p id="p-142">So when you start trying to take the focus away from the conflict toward problem-solving, toward constructive dialogue, then, and often with these softening statements, that's the best way to help someone bring their emotions down.</p>
<p id="p-143">Yeah, and the best, and then another good way to say that would be, let's figure out the best way forward.</p>
<p id="p-144">This is forward-moving momentum.</p>
<p id="p-145">This is implying a solution, right?</p>
<p id="p-146">It's not like wallowing in the problem as much.</p>
<p id="p-147">Right, and it's collaborative, right?</p>
<p id="p-148">Let's figure this out together.</p>
<p id="p-149">I'm not just telling you what I think the solution is.</p>
<p id="p-150">I'm inviting you to a dialogue where we figure it out together.</p>
<p id="p-151">Yeah, but sometimes you're just breathing fire, Aubrey, so you might just need to take some time to cool down.</p>
<p id="p-152">You cannot possibly use these phrases until you cool down and get some perspective, right?</p>
<p id="p-153">Right, and you might need a phrase to share.</p>
<p id="p-154">Rather than just walking away and maybe they'll come after you angrily, you need a phrase to let them know that you need to step away.</p>
<p id="p-155">So for example, you could...</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-156">To step away.</p>
<p id="p-157">So, for example, you could say, let's take a short break and come back to this, right?</p>
<p id="p-158">It prevents something from escalating, especially if emotions are high, just saying, acknowledging that you also need a short break.</p>
<p id="p-159">Yeah, Or you could say, I think we both need a moment to calm down.</p>
<p id="p-160">Now this one, be careful with this because you could further enrage the person if you imply that they're out of line, right?</p>
<p id="p-161">Yeah, this is tricky because like you're trying to acknowledge that both sides need time, but if there's a chance the other person would be like, I don't need time, you could just say this about yourself.</p>
<p id="p-162">You just say, you know, I I think I need a moment to calm down, so I'm just going to step back and and we could talk about this in a few minutes.</p>
<p id="p-163">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-164">And then we already kind of touched on the collaboration piece, right?</p>
<p id="p-165">But there's a couple other things that we could say.</p>
<p id="p-166">How can we work this out?</p>
<p id="p-167">And then what else, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-168">Or what would help you feel better about this?</p>
<p id="p-169">And these are also like, you maybe are trying to come up with a solution, trying to figure out what happened.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-170">to figure out what happened, and if you reach an impasse, this is, especially for like a supervisor or a manager, it's like, how can I fix the problem?</p>
<p id="p-171">And you need a way to say that, right?</p>
<p id="p-172">How can I make it right?</p>
<p id="p-173">Yeah, So many phrases, so many words, so many ways to do it, Aubrey, right?</p>
<p id="p-174">Yeah, Okay, so let's do a role play, and we're gonna put these into action.</p>
<p id="p-175">So Aubrey, here we are two drivers.</p>
<p id="p-176">Our names are Sam and Taylor.</p>
<p id="p-177">Is that right?</p>
<p id="p-178">This can't be us because I'm going to be maybe a little uh</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-179">Can't we ask, because I'm gonna be maybe a little ornery, so I'm gonna have to put on my acting skills, because I have just, you hit me and I'm very angry.</p>
<p id="p-180">Oh boy, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-181">Okay, so we're getting out of the car, walking towards each other, maybe.</p>
<p id="p-182">Exactly, I'll start us out ready.</p>
<p id="p-183">Okay, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-184">Look at my bumper.</p>
<p id="p-185">This is your fault.</p>
<p id="p-186">You totally ran that light.</p>
<p id="p-187">Whoa, I can see you're upset.</p>
<p id="p-188">I'm okay.</p>
<p id="p-189">I'm okay.</p>
<p id="p-190">Are you okay?</p>
<p id="p-191">I'm okay, I think, but my car, this is ridiculous.</p>
<p id="p-192">I understand.</p>
<p id="p-193">I'm really sorry this happened.</p>
<p id="p-194">I shouldn't have tried to make the light.</p>
<p id="p-195">Let's handle this calmly so we can get it sorted.</p>
<p id="p-196">This is terrible timing.</p>
<p id="p-197">I was on the way to pick up my kids.</p>
<p id="p-198">I'm sorry about that.</p>
<p id="p-199">Let's exchange insurance information and take photos of the damage.</p>
<p id="p-200">Okay, that sounds good.</p>
<p id="p-201">Thank you for staying calm.</p>
<p id="p-202">I know it's frustrating.</p>
<p id="p-203">We'll handle this step by step.</p>
<p id="p-204">All right, let's do that.</p>
<p id="p-205">All right.</p>
<p id="p-206">I'm a little too calm for someone that just hit a car, right?</p>
<p id="p-207">It's supposed to be just a minor fender bender, so like...</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-208">just a minor fender bender, so like, I'm probably overreacting, right?</p>
<p id="p-209">We're, neither of us are injured, like you just maybe barely bumped me, but even so, sometimes people just immediately are enraged.</p>
<p id="p-210">Maybe they've been dealing with other things, right?</p>
<p id="p-211">And it's just all coming out.</p>
<p id="p-212">Well, that's the thing.</p>
<p id="p-213">It's usually not about that moment that someone bumps you in the airport or something.</p>
<p id="p-214">It's really about everything else they haven't dealt with in their lives.</p>
<p id="p-215">We have this idiom, the straw that broke the camel's back.</p>
<p id="p-216">I mean, it's like the tiny little last thing that's what causes you to erupt.</p>
<p id="p-217">But these days, everyone is just at the top of that, right?</p>
<p id="p-218">It seems like.</p>
<p id="p-219">We're all at a boiling point.</p>
<p id="p-220">Yeah, it seems like it.</p>
<p id="p-221">So we will need these phrases.</p>
<p id="p-222">Anything to go over here specifically, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-223">Yeah, to just point out some of these de-escalation techniques that we used.</p>
<p id="p-224">So you did something really smart where you took it to safety.</p>
<p id="p-225">You're like, you know, are you okay?</p>
<p id="p-226">I'm okay.</p>
<p id="p-227">Are you okay?</p>
<p id="p-228">And then it kind of makes me realize, like, okay, maybe the damage to my car isn't the most important thing.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-229">to my car isn't the most important thing.</p>
<p id="p-230">Am I all right?</p>
<p id="p-231">We're both okay.</p>
<p id="p-232">And that immediately takes it to the human level.</p>
<p id="p-233">Yeah, and your tone of voice changed when you responded to that.</p>
<p id="p-234">You said, I'm okay, I think.</p>
<p id="p-235">Right, so that does shift the energy.</p>
<p id="p-236">And so all of a sudden, we're not necessarily like fighting against each other.</p>
<p id="p-237">We're making sure we're both physically safe.</p>
<p id="p-238">Yeah, and this really makes sense, right?</p>
<p id="p-239">If you've caused an accident, just to immediately, are you okay?</p>
<p id="p-240">Like, make sure that no one's injured and worried about that ahead of time.</p>
<p id="p-241">But also acknowledging feelings, right?</p>
<p id="p-242">You said, I can see that you're upset, like just acknowledging that instead of dismissing where... Which would probably make me even more angry.</p>
<p id="p-243">Mm.</p>
<p id="p-244">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-245">I can see that you're upset.</p>
<p id="p-246">And then what else do we have in the soup?</p>
<p id="p-247">What else did I say?</p>
<p id="p-248">Anything specific?</p>
<p id="p-249">So you were owning responsibility.</p>
<p id="p-250">You said, I shouldn't have tried to make the light.</p>
<p id="p-251">Right?</p>
<p id="p-252">I'm like, you ran the light.</p>
<p id="p-253">It's one of those where, you know, you'll try to get through it.</p>
<p id="p-254">Oh, I think I've got time.</p>
<p id="p-255">And someone else goes a little early.</p>
<p id="p-256">So, but yeah, you are owning responsibility, which this is true.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-257">You are owning responsibility, which this is tricky with a traffic accident.</p>
<p id="p-258">Often people don't want to do this.</p>
<p id="p-259">They don't want to admit fault, or maybe they're not sure if they are at fault, but in order to de-escalate the situation, sometimes this could help.</p>
<p id="p-260">Right, right, because they probably, they want to claim on their insurance that it's not their fault, right?</p>
<p id="p-261">That happens.</p>
<p id="p-262">Because then if it's your fault, your insurance probably goes up.</p>
<p id="p-263">I don't know, luckily, I've never been in one of these, so... Oh, that's good.</p>
<p id="p-264">Yeah, I don't know exactly how it works.</p>
<p id="p-265">Depends on like what the witnesses say and what the, like that depends on the laws in the different countries.</p>
<p id="p-266">Often it's like whoever hit someone from behind, even if the other person stopped short, you know, that's their fault.</p>
<p id="p-267">But then also this phrase, focusing on a solution, you know, you're saying, let's exchange insurance information and take photos.</p>
<p id="p-268">Like you are moving toward the next steps.</p>
<p id="p-269">Let's solve this, which is going to de-escalate the emotion of it.</p>
<p id="p-270">Yes, okay, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-271">So, and then at the end, I said, thank you for staying calm.</p>
<p id="p-272">I know it's frustrating.</p>
<p id="p-273">We'll handle this step by step.</p>
<p id="p-274">It sounds a little bit more like a manager who has been trained than a human being.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-275">trained than a human being on the road that I, I feel like I'd be a little more, like, if I were the one that caused the accident, I don't know if I'd be that collected.</p>
<p id="p-276">Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p id="p-277">Yeah, maybe not, right?</p>
<p id="p-278">In an ideal world, especially, I don't know, it's interesting to think about how you would react if the other person comes out just like enraged and really freaking out.</p>
<p id="p-279">You might move into like peacemaker mode, like let's de-escalate before someone- Maybe it depends on your personality, maybe.</p>
<p id="p-280">Yeah, But yeah, it sounds a little more official to me, like a trained manager, that kind of thing.</p>
<p id="p-281">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-282">All right, anything else we should go through before we finish up with this episode?</p>
<p id="p-283">Yeah, I think that's it.</p>
<p id="p-284">It is interesting how we're kind of covering both here, like what a trained manager says and what a real person says when you're in a conflict, you need to de-escalate, and you might be too emotional to be able to like use these calming phrases, but if that's the case, use one of the...</p>

<p id="p-285">But if that's the case, use one of these to step back, right?</p>
<p id="p-286">I think I need a moment to step back because more and more, I mean, in the States, you never know.</p>
<p id="p-287">Someone might have a gun in their car.</p>
<p id="p-288">You need to de-escalate.</p>
<p id="p-289">You don't want to be pushing someone's buttons and, and pushing back at someone who's really angry.</p>
<p id="p-290">It's too dangerous.</p>
<p id="p-291">Oh my God, it's too bad that we have to think about that, but it is true.</p>
<p id="p-292">I mean, it has happened that someone just pulls a gun on a car next to them, or if they cut someone cut someone off, it has happened, like in the recent years.</p>
<p id="p-293">It happens all the time.</p>
<p id="p-294">It happened just a couple of weeks ago here in Arizona.</p>
<p id="p-295">And often it's just about road rage.</p>
<p id="p-296">In fact, just a couple of weeks ago, a child was shot through a window because it was like two adults that were fighting and one shot and hit a child in their car.</p>
<p id="p-297">It's awful.</p>
<p id="p-298">So it's, it really does highlight how important it is to be the person who's willing to de-escalate, like try to control your emotions, even if you're the one that's angry, because it's not worth what the potential consequences could be.</p>
<p id="p-299">Yeah, you're so right.</p>
<p id="p-300">Really.</p>
