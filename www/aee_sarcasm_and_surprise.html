<p id="p-22">How are you today?</p>
<p id="p-23">I'm good.</p>
<p id="p-24">I'm good, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-25">How are you doing?</p>
<p id="p-26">Good, good.</p>
<p id="p-27">Michelle, has anyone surprised you recently with something they've said?</p>
<p id="p-28">I feel like we both probably are thinking of something similar.</p>
<p id="p-29">But yeah, I mean, there are some news stories where people have surprised me, but things I've said are done.</p>
<p id="p-30">But yeah, I would say that's the first thing that comes to mind.</p>
<p id="p-31">How about you?</p>
<p id="p-32">Yeah, maybe politics and never ending surprise.</p>
<p id="p-33">Yeah, but nothing else really comes to mind.</p>
<p id="p-34">But certainly when this...</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-35">But certainly when this happens for our listeners, we're all in this moment sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-36">The question is, you know, what do we say?</p>
<p id="p-37">How do we react?</p>
<p id="p-38">And we have a great listener question, which was the inspiration for today's episode from Sophia.</p>
<p id="p-39">Yes, Sophia asks awesome questions.</p>
<p id="p-40">Thank you, Sophia.</p>
<p id="p-41">We love you.</p>
<p id="p-42">Really.</p>
<p id="p-43">Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-44">For sure.</p>
<p id="p-45">And she's a listener over there on YouTube.</p>
<p id="p-46">So check out YouTube.</p>
<p id="p-47">Check out All Ears English over on YouTube.</p>

<p id="p-51">You can subscribe and you can see us on video, which is another way to consume the show.</p>
<p id="p-52">I'm going to go ahead and read Sophia's question.</p>
<p id="p-53">All right.</p>
<p id="p-54">All right.</p>
<p id="p-55">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-56">So she says, hey, I'm Sophia.</p>
<p id="p-57">I love starting my morning with coffee and your podcast.</p>
<p id="p-58">Oh, Michelle, that is so nice.</p>
<p id="p-59">We love that.</p>
<p id="p-60">Thank you.</p>
<p id="p-61">I've heard people say you don't say, but I'm not totally sure how to use it.</p>
<p id="p-62">Does it always express surprise or can it mean something else too?</p>
<p id="p-63">I'd love some examples.</p>
<p id="p-64">Thank you for your answer.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-65">some examples.</p>
<p id="p-66">Thank you for your answer.</p>
<p id="p-67">Excellent question, Sophia.</p>
<p id="p-68">Another great one, Sophia.</p>
<p id="p-69">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-70">So let's get into it.</p>
<p id="p-71">What does it mean when someone says, you don't say?</p>
<p id="p-72">Yeah, you don't say.</p>
<p id="p-73">So basically it expresses surprise.</p>
<p id="p-74">Sophia was right in what her hunch is here, is that it expresses surprise.</p>
<p id="p-75">It's kind of like saying, wow, really?</p>
<p id="p-76">And maybe you're impressed with something, but you're expressing that you are surprised.</p>
<p id="p-77">I personally don't really use this that much, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-78">Do you use this one, this expression?</p>
<p id="p-79">I don't think so.</p>
<p id="p-80">I think it is maybe a little bit old fashioned.</p>
<p id="p-81">Dated.</p>
<p id="p-82">Yeah, I think a little bit.</p>
<p id="p-83">Yeah, However, I do want to point something out.</p>
<p id="p-84">If you are going to say it, do people usually say, you don't say?</p>
<p id="p-85">It's usually, you don't. Yeah, we never say it.</p>
<p id="p-86">Connected speech here, right?</p>
<p id="p-87">You don't say.</p>
<p id="p-88">Right?</p>
<p id="p-89">You don't say.</p>
<p id="p-90">You want to connect that.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-91">You want to connect that.</p>
<p id="p-92">Mm-hmm.</p>
<p id="p-93">Totally.</p>
<p id="p-94">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-95">So before we get into some examples, we also want to say thank you to DanB303.</p>
<p id="p-96">Yes, we have an amazing listener who reviewed our podcast in the app, the iOS app.</p>
<p id="p-97">So huge thank you to DanB303.</p>
<p id="p-98">Thank you for your amazing five-star review.</p>
<p id="p-99">I'm actually going to send this to the team right away.</p>
<p id="p-100">Thank you, DanB.</p>
<p id="p-101">And guys, if you want to let us know what you think of the show, leave us a review.</p>
<p id="p-102">We love seeing these reviews.</p>
<p id="p-103">It keeps us going for you here at All Ears English.</p>
<p id="p-104">So review the show.</p>
<p id="p-105">All right.</p>
<p id="p-106">All right.</p>
<p id="p-107">Perfect.</p>
<p id="p-108">Thank you, DanB.</p>
<p id="p-109">So let's do some examples.</p>
<p id="p-110">We have some little role plays.</p>
<p id="p-111">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-112">All right.</p>
<p id="p-113">I ran four miles yesterday.</p>
<p id="p-114">You don't say.</p>
<p id="p-115">I thought you hated running.</p>
<p id="p-116">I do, but I do it every once in a while.</p>
<p id="p-117">All right.</p>
<p id="p-118">Is that true, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-119">Four miles?</p>
<p id="p-120">No, absolutely not.</p>
<p id="p-121">No way.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-122">No way.</p>
<p id="p-123">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-124">Here's the next one.</p>
<p id="p-125">I just got back from the mall.</p>
<p id="p-126">Oh, you don't say.</p>
<p id="p-127">I was there too.</p>
<p id="p-128">Yeah, I'm rarely found at the mall.</p>
<p id="p-129">Only if I have to be there, to be honest.</p>
<p id="p-130">Only if I have to be there.</p>
<p id="p-131">That's funny.</p>
<p id="p-132">I actually, on a cold day, I like to go to the mall.</p>
<p id="p-133">I don't go there when it's nights outside.</p>
<p id="p-134">I'm not going to go sit in the mall.</p>
<p id="p-135">But when it's cold and I still want to move around and walk and, you know, just kind of, I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-136">There's something nostalgic about the mall.</p>
<p id="p-137">There is absolutely something nostalgic.</p>
<p id="p-138">It reminds me of being a teenager in the 90s, right?</p>
<p id="p-139">You got dropped off for the first time by your parents.</p>
<p id="p-140">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-141">No, that never happened to me because I lived in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p id="p-142">So malls for me were actually an adventure with my mom.</p>
<p id="p-143">So she came with me.</p>
<p id="p-144">We shopped together.</p>
<p id="p-145">I never had the, I want to meet my friends at the mall thing because my town was so isolated.</p>
<p id="p-146">There was no mall.</p>
<p id="p-147">There was no real mall.</p>
<p id="p-148">There was like kind of a mill, but it wasn't the same.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-149">But yeah, it wasn't the same as your typical commercial mall.</p>
<p id="p-150">Yeah, I missed that.</p>
<p id="p-151">Yeah, it was Lake Forest Mall.</p>
<p id="p-152">And yeah, it was always so, I mean, I loved going with my parents too.</p>
<p id="p-153">I loved going shopping with my mom.</p>
<p id="p-154">And yeah, but it was very much, oh, let's go to, let's, everybody meet at the mall.</p>
<p id="p-155">And we go to the food court at the mall.</p>
<p id="p-156">I think a great movie for our listeners to check out to get the sense of this 90s consumer culture and teenager culture, right, would be Clueless.</p>
<p id="p-157">Clueless is always on TV.</p>
<p id="p-158">And it's a fantastic movie just to get a glimpse into 1990s California teenager culture, mall culture.</p>
<p id="p-159">So check that out, guys.</p>
<p id="p-160">Classic.</p>
<p id="p-161">All right.</p>
<p id="p-162">So, Lindsay, would you say this is mostly, when you say you don't say, would you say it's mostly for positive surprises or also for negatives?</p>
<p id="p-163">Yeah, I would say, yeah, if someone says something really bad, I would definitely not.</p>
<p id="p-164">If someone's family member died, I would</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-165">Nah, if someone's family member died, I would never say, you don't say.</p>
<p id="p-166">No, no, no.</p>
<p id="p-167">This is not.</p>
<p id="p-168">It's not for that.</p>
<p id="p-169">Even, you know, anything.</p>
<p id="p-170">It's for positive things.</p>
<p id="p-171">Things that are maybe a little surprising and they're positive, but they're not a huge deal either.</p>
<p id="p-172">Like if you say, oh, I won the lottery.</p>
<p id="p-173">You don't say.</p>
<p id="p-174">It's a little.</p>
<p id="p-175">I would say, oh, my gosh, are you serious?</p>
<p id="p-176">That's amazing.</p>
<p id="p-177">What are you going to do?</p>
<p id="p-178">I wouldn't say you don't say.</p>
<p id="p-179">It's kind of like you don't say.</p>
<p id="p-180">It's kind of like, oh, that's interesting.</p>
<p id="p-181">Basically that idea.</p>
<p id="p-182">However, I do want to talk about one other similar.</p>
<p id="p-183">I mean, well, a little bit different way that we do use you don't say.</p>
<p id="p-184">So this one would be, it's also expressing surprise, but it might be a little bit more sarcastic.</p>
<p id="p-185">Let's do this role play and then we'll talk about how it sounds.</p>
<p id="p-186">Yeah, we love sarcasm.</p>
<p id="p-187">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-188">Oh, no.</p>
<p id="p-189">Buddy ate another shoe.</p>
<p id="p-190">You don't say.</p>
<p id="p-191">I told you to put them away.</p>
<p id="p-192">Yeah, so we've said earlier that this.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-193">that we've said earlier that this idiom in the non-sarcastic sense, in the genuine sense, might be a little dated and I agree with that.</p>
<p id="p-194">80s, 90s, right?</p>
<p id="p-195">But if you use it sarcastically, maybe it's even more relevant right now.</p>
<p id="p-196">Okay?</p>
<p id="p-197">Right, So this is basically saying like, oh really, I knew that was going to happen.</p>
<p id="p-198">Like almost maybe kind of like I told you so, right?</p>
<p id="p-199">I told you so.</p>
<p id="p-200">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-201">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-202">Let's try another so our listeners can get the vibe.</p>
<p id="p-203">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-204">Ugh, I feel terrible after that meal.</p>
<p id="p-205">You don't say.</p>
<p id="p-206">McDonald's isn't healthy?</p>
<p id="p-207">Yeah, I'm being really, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-208">And I can see myself saying this.</p>
<p id="p-209">While you eat McDonald's, what do you expect?</p>
<p id="p-210">You know, that's essentially what you're saying, right?</p>
<p id="p-211">Right, So this is just another way that you can use it.</p>
<p id="p-212">Yeah, Love it.</p>
<p id="p-213">初めての世界がすぐそこにアメリカン航空とJALのパートナーシップが。</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-214">国とJALのパートナーシップが、あなたの旅にもっと自由と快適さをお届けします。日本からロサンゼルス、ニューヨーク、ダラス、シカゴなどアメリカ主要都市へ直行便、さらに中南米各地へもスムーズにアクセス。つながり、つばさ、広がる空の旅。アメリカン航空とJALで世界がもっと近くなる。Alright Michelle, we are back to talk a little bit about tone of voice and context.</p>
<p id="p-215">What do we need to know here?</p>
<p id="p-216">Right, well so we've given you kind of two ways, a more sarcastic way and a more genuine way that this is used.</p>
<p id="p-217">And so first of all, Lindsay, to ask you which way you would hear it most, it sounds like you think that the more sarcastic way is more relevant to now and maybe the other one is more dated, right?</p>
<p id="p-218">Yeah, I watched this great show, which our listeners would love this if you're studying language and history.</p>
<p id="p-219">The show called Ghosts.</p>
<p id="p-220">I've mentioned this before, but what it is, it's a story of</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-221">But what it is, it's a story of this old mansion in upstate New York.</p>
<p id="p-222">And there are all these ghosts that died in the house at different times throughout history.</p>
<p id="p-223">Like there's a Viking.</p>
<p id="p-224">There's someone from the 1800s, like a wife of a robber baron.</p>
<p id="p-225">There is a singer from like the blues ages, like the 20s.</p>
<p id="p-226">Yeah, And anyways, there's a guy from the 80s.</p>
<p id="p-227">And you can, every line that's written in that show is based on their time of living.</p>
<p id="p-228">So they speak in a certain way.</p>
<p id="p-229">So this guy, Pete, he is from the 80s.</p>
<p id="p-230">And I could totally say, hear him saying genuinely, oh, we got tickets for the concert.</p>
<p id="p-231">You don't say, right?</p>
<p id="p-232">Yeah, Very 80s, genuine, smiley way.</p>
<p id="p-233">What I'm trying to say is watch that show, number one, to get the historical references.</p>
<p id="p-234">And number two, it is a little dated.</p>
<p id="p-235">So I would use the sarcastic way probably at this point.</p>
<p id="p-236">Yeah, Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p id="p-237">Maybe, I don't know what that says about us as a society.</p>
<p id="p-238">I know.</p>
<p id="p-239">What does that say about us?</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-240">I know, what does that say about our good questions?</p>
<p id="p-241">We're becoming more sarcastic.</p>
<p id="p-242">Yeah, good question.</p>
<p id="p-243">But again, you have to think about the context if you're hearing it.</p>
<p id="p-244">Which way is it being used?</p>
<p id="p-245">So the first one is more like, oh, you don't say.</p>
<p id="p-246">And the second one is more, oh, you don't say.</p>
<p id="p-247">So you have to think about that and think, is this being used in a sarcastic way?</p>
<p id="p-248">Is this person actually genuinely surprised by what I said or are they kind of saying, I told you so, I knew it or duh.</p>
<p id="p-249">It's so important to pay attention to tone of voice and context, 100%. And if we want to get away from you don't say, if we just don't like it for whatever reason, we can say other things.</p>
<p id="p-250">Right, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-251">And these might be a little more relevant genuinely for 2025.</p>
<p id="p-252">No way, right?</p>
<p id="p-253">This one is very relevant.</p>
<p id="p-254">No way, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-255">So no way, you're coming to visit?</p>
<p id="p-256">Right?</p>
<p id="p-257">And this is, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-258">This one, do you find yourself?</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-259">This one do you find yourself using, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-260">I do.</p>
<p id="p-261">I certainly do.</p>
<p id="p-262">I think so.</p>
<p id="p-263">Yeah, I would say so.</p>
<p id="p-264">This is pretty common.</p>
<p id="p-265">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-266">You were going to say something.</p>
<p id="p-267">I cut you off.</p>
<p id="p-268">I was going to say, would you hear this one in the sarcastic sense as well?</p>
<p id="p-269">Like the, oh, no way, right?</p>
<p id="p-270">Yeah, I would.</p>
<p id="p-271">Yes, Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p id="p-272">Yeah, I think it could be as expected.</p>
<p id="p-273">You got this, right?</p>
<p id="p-274">That's the cynical, sarcastic way of listening.</p>
<p id="p-275">Yeah, What else?</p>
<p id="p-276">Get out of here.</p>
<p id="p-277">Oh, isn't there some kind of reference to a movie?</p>
<p id="p-278">Get out of here.</p>
<p id="p-279">I feel like there's something there, Michelle, but I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-280">No, no, no, there is.</p>
<p id="p-281">Well, I always think people also say, wait, hold on, I'm seeing if I can find it.</p>
<p id="p-282">Get out of here meme.</p>
<p id="p-283">Let's see.</p>
<p id="p-284">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-285">I'm not sure.</p>
<p id="p-286">It may have to be a follow-up episode.</p>
<p id="p-287">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-288">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-289">It looks like it's in a lot of movies.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-290">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-291">It looks like it's in a lot of movies.</p>
<p id="p-292">Anyway.</p>
<p id="p-293">But also sometimes people just say, get out, right?</p>
<p id="p-294">Get out.</p>
<p id="p-295">And that one, it makes me think of Elaine from Seinfeld because if somebody says something surprising, she'll say, get out! And she pushes that person.</p>
<p id="p-296">I'm so glad you mentioned the get out because if our listeners didn't know, we might make the mistake of thinking this person's asked me to leave and we turn around and we leave.</p>
<p id="p-297">Right?</p>
<p id="p-298">No, we're not being asked to leave.</p>
<p id="p-299">The person is basically shortening the expression, get out of here.</p>
<p id="p-300">And she's saying, get out.</p>
<p id="p-301">I hear this more with women for some reason.</p>
<p id="p-302">Maybe it is because of Elaine.</p>
<p id="p-303">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-304">It feels like a more female phrase.</p>
<p id="p-305">Have you heard her say that?</p>
<p id="p-306">Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-307">And it feels like something she would say too.</p>
<p id="p-308">Yeah, Yeah, So here we go.</p>
<p id="p-309">Here's an example.</p>
<p id="p-310">It's raining again.</p>
<p id="p-311">Get out of here.</p>
<p id="p-312">So that is more of the I'm surprised, but I'm also annoyed.</p>
<p id="p-313">Right?</p>
<p id="p-314">So like, again, it can have that kind of sarcastic...</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-315">It can have that kind of sarcastic tone or it can be more genuine.</p>
<p id="p-316">Yeah, and I think I almost feel like Get Out is even more extreme.</p>
<p id="p-317">Like you won tickets to the concert?</p>
<p id="p-318">Get out! Get out! It's like you're almost... That's a pause.</p>
<p id="p-319">Get out! It's kind of like you're saying, I don't believe you.</p>
<p id="p-320">Get out of this room, right?</p>
<p id="p-321">Right, but you're not saying get out.</p>
<p id="p-322">Don't leave the room, guys.</p>
<p id="p-323">Don't leave the room.</p>
<p id="p-324">Now I'm just imagining, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-325">Oh, I'm so glad we're going over this.</p>
<p id="p-326">So that somebody doesn't just actually walk out the door.</p>
<p id="p-327">Right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-328">And I think this also comes into people's personal vocabulary.</p>
<p id="p-329">Like Elaine, some people tend to say this more than others, right?</p>
<p id="p-330">Yeah, Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-331">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-332">Or what's another one, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-333">Is that so?</p>
<p id="p-334">Right, so for example, is that so?</p>
<p id="p-335">You're leaving tomorrow?</p>
<p id="p-336">Right, so again, this is a way of receiving news that maybe you didn't know and maybe you're a little surprised.</p>
<p id="p-337">And this one, I would say, is a little more formal sounding.</p>
<p id="p-338">Yes, I agree.</p>
<p id="p-339">Maybe a little older as well.</p>
<p id="p-340">I don't picture...</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-341">Like, I don't picture, you know, Gen Zers saying this.</p>
<p id="p-342">You know, I don't picture anyone under age 50 maybe saying it.</p>
<p id="p-343">It feels older to me.</p>
<p id="p-344">Yeah, a little bit older.</p>
<p id="p-345">Or then there's, you guys know this, really?</p>
<p id="p-346">Right?</p>
<p id="p-347">Really common.</p>
<p id="p-348">You can't make it?</p>
<p id="p-349">Really?</p>
<p id="p-350">Yeah, Yep.</p>
<p id="p-351">Which one of these do you tend to use, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-352">I would say no way or, I mean, or, I mean, there's nothing wrong with just saying really?</p>
<p id="p-353">Yeah, really.</p>
<p id="p-354">For me, it's no way.</p>
<p id="p-355">No way.</p>
<p id="p-356">No way.</p>
<p id="p-357">You put a lot of tone into that response.</p>
<p id="p-358">Right, Love it.</p>
<p id="p-359">Let's do a role play.</p>
<p id="p-360">All right?</p>
<p id="p-361">All right.</p>
<p id="p-362">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-363">We are friends and you are telling me about your trip.</p>
<p id="p-364">All right.</p>
<p id="p-365">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-366">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-367">So was it amazing?</p>
<p id="p-368">Well, I ate my way through all of London.</p>
<p id="p-369">Oh, you don't say.</p>
<p id="p-370">I know you're a foodie.</p>
<p id="p-371">Yeah, I think I ate Indian.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-372">I think I ate Indian food every single night.</p>
<p id="p-373">Is that so?</p>
<p id="p-374">Was it delicious?</p>
<p id="p-375">Incredible.</p>
<p id="p-376">I haven't eaten Indian food in ages.</p>
<p id="p-377">Really?</p>
<p id="p-378">I thought it's your favorite.</p>
<p id="p-379">I know.</p>
<p id="p-380">I just haven't had it.</p>
<p id="p-381">I don't know why.</p>
<p id="p-382">I've actually been cooking a lot at home.</p>
<p id="p-383">Get out of here.</p>
<p id="p-384">I didn't know you cook.</p>
<p id="p-385">I do now.</p>
<p id="p-386">So how was the weather in London?</p>
<p id="p-387">Rain, rain, rain.</p>
<p id="p-388">No way.</p>
<p id="p-389">Were you being sarcastic there?</p>
<p id="p-390">No way.</p>
<p id="p-391">Yeah, We know it rains in London.</p>
<p id="p-392">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-393">Although the times I've been to London, it's been beautiful.</p>
<p id="p-394">I'm going again at the end of May.</p>
<p id="p-395">So I will update that knowledge base.</p>
<p id="p-396">You are?</p>
<p id="p-397">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-398">I'm going for a conference and then for a little vacay to travel around Belgium and different parts of Europe.</p>
<p id="p-399">Yeah, should be good.</p>
<p id="p-400">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-401">That's where I studied abroad, I think you know.</p>
<p id="p-402">Yeah, you're going to have to tell me all your haunts.</p>
<p id="p-403">All your haunts, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-404">When's the last time you were there, my haunts?</p>
<p id="p-405">I haven't been there in a while.</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p id="p-406">I haven't been there in a long, long time, like 25 years, I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-407">Oh, okay, that's a long time.</p>
<p id="p-408">Yeah, I was there a couple years ago, so yeah, maybe I can give you some suggestions.</p>
<p id="p-409">Excellent, looking forward to that.</p>
<p id="p-410">All right, let's go through this, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-411">So I started, I said, oh, I ate my way through London, meaning I just sampled all the food, right?</p>
<p id="p-412">Yeah, that's something common when people talk about their vacations where they ate a lot, they might say, oh, I ate my way through this place.</p>
<p id="p-413">I highly recommend doing that anytime you travel.</p>
<p id="p-414">I love to do food tours, you know, things like that.</p>
<p id="p-415">Me too.</p>
<p id="p-416">The best.</p>
<p id="p-417">Yeah, and I said, you don't say, I know you're a foodie.</p>
<p id="p-418">Now, this is interesting because am I using this genuinely or sarcastically?</p>
<p id="p-419">I don't know if it's, like, I don't think it's sarcastic with like a meanness to it, but kind of a, I think it's sarcastic in a way of like, oh, I'm not surprised, I know you.</p>
<p id="p-420">Exactly, that's what I think it is too.</p>
<p id="p-421">So it's not fully genuine, you're not telling me something surprising, right?</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p id="p-422">Something surprising, right?</p>
<p id="p-423">Because that's what we talk about the genuine response.</p>
<p id="p-424">There is sarcasm in there, but it's not a cynical sarcasm.</p>
<p id="p-425">It's a positive sarcasm.</p>
<p id="p-426">You don't say, like, I'm not surprised that you ate your way through London.</p>
<p id="p-427">Right?</p>
<p id="p-428">Right, And then you said, I think I ate Indian food every night.</p>
<p id="p-429">London has some amazing Indian food.</p>
<p id="p-430">And so I said, is that so?</p>
<p id="p-431">Was it delicious?</p>
<p id="p-432">Yeah, And maybe this one is a little more genuine.</p>
<p id="p-433">Maybe I didn't know that or something.</p>
<p id="p-434">Yeah, A lot of Indian food in London, right?</p>
<p id="p-435">And then you said, I haven't eaten Indian food in ages.</p>
<p id="p-436">And then I said, what?</p>
<p id="p-437">I said, really?</p>
<p id="p-438">I thought it's your favorite.</p>
<p id="p-439">So that's a genuine.</p>
<p id="p-440">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-441">And then you said, I've actually been cooking a lot at home.</p>
<p id="p-442">And I said, get out of here.</p>
<p id="p-443">I didn't know you cooked.</p>
<p id="p-444">And I'm sort of saying, oh, you're not telling the truth.</p>
<p id="p-445">You're, you know, I don't believe you.</p>
<p id="p-446">Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-447">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-448">And then when I asked about the weather in London.</p>
<h2>Part-21</h2>
<p id="p-449">And then when I asked about the weather in London, you said rain, rain, rain.</p>
<p id="p-450">And I said, no way.</p>
<p id="p-451">Like, I know.</p>
<p id="p-452">Yeah, I'm sarcastic because I know it's common to rain in London.</p>
<p id="p-453">Yes, I love that this episode has actually been an exploration in sarcasm, actually.</p>
