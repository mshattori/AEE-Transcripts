<p id="p-5">Do you like to shop in second hand clothing stores? What about buying seconds when it comes to clothing? These two things mean something different.</p>
<p id="p-6">Listen in to explore a connection topic around fashion?</p>
<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p id="p-7">Connection topic around fashion choices today.</p>
<p id="p-8">Hello, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-9">How's everything going? Happy Saturday.</p>
<p id="p-10">I'm great.</p>
<p id="p-11">Happy Saturday to you, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-12">How are you? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-13">So excited that we're publishing on Saturdays now for our listeners.</p>
<p id="p-14">I'm doing great.</p>
<p id="p-15">But I do have a question for you.</p>
<p id="p-16">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-17">Let's hear it.</p>
<p id="p-18">So, do you often buy seconds? Yes, Like second minutes.</p>
<p id="p-19">What am I even talking about? You're talking about, like, from an outlet store, right? There's near us.</p>
<p id="p-20">We have Nordstrom Rack.</p>
<p id="p-21">There's Nordstrom you may have heard of and then there's Nordstrom Rack where you can buy seconds.</p>
<p id="p-22">Anything that didn't sell at Nordstrom.</p>
<p id="p-23">And then there's what's called Last Chance in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>
<p id="p-24">It's like everything that doesn't sell at Nordstrom rack and that's where you can really get the deals.</p>
<p id="p-25">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-26">Good to know.</p>
<p id="p-27">Good to know.</p>
<p id="p-28">Do you go shopping a lot? I don't, I really hate shopping actually, but when I do, I often I go for the clearance, I go for seconds and this came up recently, you and Michelle were chatting</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-29">Recently you and Michelle were chatting and I heard you say the word seconds, you were talking about outlet stores and that's where you buy seconds.</p>
<p id="p-30">And I hadn't heard it referred to that or at least not recently.</p>
<p id="p-31">So I googled it.</p>
<p id="p-32">I'm like, oh, yeah, that's what they call it.</p>
<p id="p-33">Seconds when you like, buy something that didn't sell at a regular retail store.</p>
<p id="p-34">Right? Yeah, you don't hear it very much, but I don't, I grew up in New England and there are a lot of retail store, new second hand or second stores in Maine.</p>
<p id="p-35">Ky Maine, kind of famous for that kind of outlet.</p>
<p id="p-36">And so you hear it sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-37">So we're introducing something new to our listeners today.</p>
<p id="p-38">Yes, because I immediately highlighted that as vocabulary in the app because I knew like, oh, this is interesting.</p>
<p id="p-39">This is unique and you almost said second hand there, which means something different.</p>
<p id="p-40">So we're going into some vocab sort of related, but that does mean different things.</p>
<p id="p-41">And we want to make sure that you are using the app.</p>
<p id="p-42">That's the best way to learn new vocabulary and follow along with the transcripts.</p>
<p id="p-43">Yes, And we just did a new release on the app and that's why we want to make sure you guys.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-44">On the app and that's why we want to make sure you guys know, I mean, it is the best way to listen to the podcast ad free.</p>
<p id="p-45">So on the app, you won't hear any commercials coming in from with other voices that you don't know, you won't hear those ads on the app.</p>
<p id="p-46">Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-47">What else do our listeners get over on the app if they listen there? Yeah, you can also listen at different speeds that aren't available on the average podcast player.</p>
<p id="p-48">This is really nice for me because two times even 1.5 is sometimes too fast.</p>
<p id="p-49">Sometimes I want to have it be a little more specific.</p>
<p id="p-50">So you have that opportunity on the app and we also have a special bonus feed for premium users.</p>
<p id="p-51">So these bonus episodes are amazing and bonus roll plays a lot over there that you don't want to miss.</p>
<p id="p-52">Yeah, some new stuff coming in there that you definitely want to check out another way.</p>
<p id="p-53">So a better way to listen guys is the app.</p>
<p id="p-54">So go over to all ESL dot com slash app.</p>
<p id="p-55">We have it for I Os and Android and check it out.</p>
<p id="p-56">Check it out.</p>
<p id="p-57">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-58">Yes, All right.</p>
<p id="p-59">So let's dive in the episode.</p>
<p id="p-60">I.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-61">Dive in the episode.</p>
<p id="p-62">I was referring to if you guys missed it.</p>
<p id="p-63">You don't remember this conversation.</p>
<p id="p-64">Go back and listen to 2240 Lindsay and Michelle were talking about outlets and some of the shopping vocabulary they mentioned seconds.</p>
<p id="p-65">So don't miss that one hit.</p>
<p id="p-66">Follow if you missed it.</p>
<p id="p-67">And we're going to go into some sort of related vocab today.</p>
<p id="p-68">Yeah, I'm excited to get into it.</p>
<p id="p-69">So let's define seconds when we talk about seconds in the shopping world, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-70">Let's just break it down again to be very clear.</p>
<p id="p-71">Yeah, they're also called factory seconds.</p>
<p id="p-72">And I've also seen them online referred to as factory rejects or simply seconds and they're just retail items that there may be like a minor fault of manufacture or maybe not.</p>
<p id="p-73">They may have like over purchased, right? And so then they're sold for some reason to the public at a reduced rate at outlets or, right.</p>
<p id="p-74">It's often due to overproduction is what I've read so often.</p>
<p id="p-75">There are no mistakes with these.</p>
<p id="p-76">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-77">And even if there are mistakes, you probably wouldn't be able to notice it</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-78">You probably wouldn't be able to notice it.</p>
<p id="p-79">It's not like we're saying they're missing a sleeve.</p>
<p id="p-80">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-81">Not that extreme.</p>
<p id="p-82">Right, Maybe a hem is a tiny bit off or something.</p>
<p id="p-83">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-84">So there are lots of places in the US and probably where you live.</p>
<p id="p-85">I actually would be really curious to hear from our listeners.</p>
<p id="p-86">Come to youtube.</p>
<p id="p-87">Leave us a comment.</p>
<p id="p-88">Do you purchase seconds? Do you have outlet stores where you live? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-89">Out l shopping is a whole thing.</p>
<p id="p-90">Some people love it.</p>
<p id="p-91">Just love outlet shopping.</p>
<p id="p-92">I think Michelle loves it.</p>
<p id="p-93">I think she must have mentioned that in that episode.</p>
<p id="p-94">Yes, Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-95">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-96">But there is a different meaning of seconds when you first said it, this is the meaning I'm more familiar with, which is when you go back to get a second helping of food.</p>
<p id="p-97">Right? Some people say a second helping.</p>
<p id="p-98">Some people just say seconds.</p>
<p id="p-99">I'm going back for seconds.</p>
<p id="p-100">That is much more common.</p>
<p id="p-101">I would say when we're talking about eating and sitting down with the family for dinner or, you know, did you get seconds? Do you want seconds? Much more common? I would say I might say to my kids don't get seconds until everyone has had a.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-102">Until everyone has had a first helping, for sure, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-103">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-104">So that those are the two meanings.</p>
<p id="p-105">Now, there's a second meaning we can expand off of this idea, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-106">What is it? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-107">Well, this I think is what really makes this confusing.</p>
<p id="p-108">We want to make sure to clarify today because the same word second is in the phrase, the adjective second hand, this is very different.</p>
<p id="p-109">Right? Seconds from a factory.</p>
<p id="p-110">These are still new.</p>
<p id="p-111">No one has already purchased and worn these, but a very similar word second hand means it is previously used or owned.</p>
<p id="p-112">It's true.</p>
<p id="p-113">And I almost really confuse our listeners because I almost used them changeably at the top of the show.</p>
<p id="p-114">They're not, they're not the same at all.</p>
<p id="p-115">Right, because thrift stores are where you would get second hand clothing, for example, Poshmark Thread up thrifted dot com or even Salvation Army.</p>
<p id="p-116">Right, That kind of thing.</p>
<p id="p-117">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-118">There are a lot of thrift stores, retail stores where you can go in person and this has become a big thing online.</p>
<p id="p-119">A lot of those companies.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-120">Online.</p>
<p id="p-121">A lot of those companies you just listed now provide the second hand clothing, thrifted clothing online.</p>
<p id="p-122">This was, I mean, it's been around for a few years, but I remember this sort of being a big deal.</p>
<p id="p-123">It was like, oh my goodness, I can buy second hand clothing online.</p>
<p id="p-124">I didn't even know that.</p>
<p id="p-125">I didn't even know that because often it's interesting.</p>
<p id="p-126">Some thrift stores you go and there is no like fitting room a place where you would try something on.</p>
<p id="p-127">It's sort of just like you buy it, take it home, try it on.</p>
<p id="p-128">Too bad.</p>
<p id="p-129">You might not be able to return clothing.</p>
<p id="p-130">It's a little bit different situation than the average retail store.</p>
<p id="p-131">I see.</p>
<p id="p-132">And then there's also second hand bookstores which a lot of people just love.</p>
<p id="p-133">You know, I actually mentioned I was planning this episode when we had an open conversation club and Aden, one of our amazing listeners from Brazil who often is an open conversation club, got really excited.</p>
<p id="p-134">She was like, I love second hand bookstores and I agree with her.</p>
<p id="p-135">We were able to really bond about that.</p>
<p id="p-136">I love the smell of a second hand bookstore, like older books.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-137">Or like older books or something.</p>
<p id="p-138">You just want to be able to touch them and smell them.</p>
<p id="p-139">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-140">Oh, they're usually so quaint and small and just such a clear love for books from the owners.</p>
<p id="p-141">Right? You could just tell there's a respect for literature and reading.</p>
<p id="p-142">I love that one.</p>
<p id="p-143">It's a very unique place.</p>
<p id="p-144">So we have a few examples here.</p>
<p id="p-145">You could say, can you believe I found this second hand if you have a shirt that you love and you found it at a thrift store, it looks brand new or I'm going to try to find a costume second hand.</p>
<p id="p-146">They're so expensive online.</p>
<p id="p-147">That's a good idea.</p>
<p id="p-148">There should be like a marketplace where people swap, uh Halloween costumes.</p>
<p id="p-149">That'd be brilliant.</p>
<p id="p-150">Is that exists online now.</p>
<p id="p-151">I know a lot of thrift stores at Halloween time, bring out all of the Halloween costumes for a place to go get a costume because you don't need that brand new, especially if you're wearing it like over your other clothing.</p>
<p id="p-152">When I was a kid, we used to always make our Halloween costumes.</p>
<p id="p-153">We would never even thought about buying it we used to have to just make it, to be creative, like you put it on.</p>
<p id="p-154">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-155">Kind of.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-156">Put it on.</p>
<p id="p-157">Yeah, kind of.</p>
<p id="p-158">That's awesome.</p>
<p id="p-159">We did, we had these Halloween bins.</p>
<p id="p-160">It was like, go find something in the bin.</p>
<p id="p-161">Do your best.</p>
<p id="p-162">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-163">Do your best.</p>
<p id="p-164">And then what would be another sample sentence with second hand you're talking about second hand bookstores.</p>
<p id="p-165">You might ask someone, what's your favorite second hand bookstore? Just like Adam and I found out we had this in common.</p>
<p id="p-166">What a great way to connect when you find out you both love something like this.</p>
<p id="p-167">Go deeper, right? Where's your favorite place to buy used books? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-168">And I know a famous one in New York is the strand.</p>
<p id="p-169">I don't know if they're second hand though.</p>
<p id="p-170">Are they second hand or just a, just a, you know, the strand, right? I'll bring downtown.</p>
<p id="p-171">But I feel like it's new books.</p>
<p id="p-172">I feel like it's more like a Bar and Noble or Borders where it's new books.</p>
<p id="p-173">I think it is, but it's more, from what I understand.</p>
<p id="p-174">It's more of like an icon, less, less commercial, less corporate and more of an icon for downtown New York N Y U area.</p>
<p id="p-175">They, they love it because you see people going around with the logo, the bags, you know what I'm talking about.</p>
<p id="p-176">Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-177">We used to go to strand a lot.</p>
<p id="p-178">It's huge in there and I bet they do have a second hand section.</p>
<p id="p-179">At least some used books.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-180">At least, I bet they have some used books in there as well, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-181">So anyways, good New York City insider knowledge.</p>
<p id="p-182">What's number three? So just to say used, this means the same as second hand, you might say used clothing, used books, right? It means the same thing you might say.</p>
<p id="p-183">I love finding cool vintage used clothing, but thrifting definitely takes more time than regular shopping drifting.</p>
<p id="p-184">Interesting as a verb.</p>
<p id="p-185">Drifting.</p>
<p id="p-186">That is probably going to be in the app as a key word, don't you think? Yes, definitely.</p>
<p id="p-187">Make sure you have the app so you can get all this great vocab.</p>
<p id="p-188">It's fun to use it as a verb this way and to ask someone, do you like thrifting, Jessica from our team? And I sort of bonded about this.</p>
<p id="p-189">We both love thrifting.</p>
<p id="p-190">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-191">All right.</p>
<p id="p-192">Very cool.</p>
<p id="p-193">What would be another example? So I'm not above wearing used clothing, right? I love this.</p>
<p id="p-194">I've definitely said this right? When people talk about it, I'm like, yeah, I'm not above thrifting.</p>
<p id="p-195">I'm not above wearing used clothing because some, some people</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-196">Wearing used clothing because some people do want everything to be new.</p>
<p id="p-197">They're looking for new name brands, trendy clothing.</p>
<p id="p-198">And then so this might be something, this phrase this chunk to say you're not above something means like I've got no shame.</p>
<p id="p-199">I don't think I'm too good for this.</p>
<p id="p-200">Oh man, I just try to avoid shopping entirely.</p>
<p id="p-201">I don't know or have people give me things.</p>
<p id="p-202">I just don't even want to go into any shop.</p>
<p id="p-203">I just want to get the way.</p>
<p id="p-204">So we all have this is a great connection skill for our listeners today.</p>
<p id="p-205">What is your style? Because this is another one of those skills that says a lot about who we are.</p>
<p id="p-206">Right, Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-207">Yes, Definitely.</p>
<p id="p-208">OK, Aubrey, where to next? Yes, Our last term for today is hand me downs.</p>
<p id="p-209">This is what we called it growing up.</p>
<p id="p-210">And this is often like if your older sister, if my older sister had something that she no longer was using, maybe it fits me.</p>
<p id="p-211">Now, we would call this a hand me down like she's handing it down to me.</p>
<p id="p-212">So clothing passed on to another person after it was used or</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-213">After it was used or outgrown.</p>
<p id="p-214">I have a neighbor that gives me hand me downs from her son for my son.</p>
<p id="p-215">Oh, yeah, I still use this term.</p>
<p id="p-216">Hand me downs, right? What would be a sample sentence? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-217">So I could say I had older sisters.</p>
<p id="p-218">So I wore a lot of hand me downs growing up.</p>
<p id="p-219">So it's a noun like this, right? Any of this used clothing we would call hand me downs if someone passed it up to you.</p>
<p id="p-220">And how do you write this? It looks like a compound noun with multiple words.</p>
<p id="p-221">How do we, how do we write it? It's hyphenated hand hyphen me hyphen down or downs if it's plural.</p>
<p id="p-222">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-223">Good question.</p>
<p id="p-224">A lot of these compound nouns are hyphenated.</p>
<p id="p-225">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-226">And it's not like we would conjugate this, right? Even though or in any way we wouldn't change it.</p>
<p id="p-227">It's just a noun.</p>
<p id="p-228">So it stays the same.</p>
<p id="p-229">Uh it would just be plural or singular and we do that, we'll separate the trunk to make it a verb and hand is the verb, right? So she handed me down some clothing we'll say right.</p>
<p id="p-230">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-231">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-232">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-233">But it would be just.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-234">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-235">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-236">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-237">But it would be just hand that we would change and then it would separate.</p>
<p id="p-238">There wouldn't be hyphens if we turn hand into a verb and we never change the pronoun.</p>
<p id="p-239">We would never say hand you down.</p>
<p id="p-240">No, never.</p>
<p id="p-241">I'm going to hand you down this.</p>
<p id="p-242">I'm going, no, we would just say I'm going to give you this clothing if you can use it.</p>
<p id="p-243">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-244">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-245">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-246">Good.</p>
<p id="p-247">OK, What else, Aubrey? What else do we need to know? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-248">So I think there's an interesting cultural piece here for me, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-249">I'm going to ask you if it's the same for you.</p>
<p id="p-250">I wouldn't ask someone like, would you like my hand me downs or would you like my son's used clothing? There are different ways to say this.</p>
<p id="p-251">I think the assumption is if someone else is uncomfortable with me implying that they need used clothing, what I would say is like, hey, I have a stack of clothing my son has grown out of.</p>
<p id="p-252">Would you like to see if you could use any of it before I donate it? It's interesting how as I thought about this, I'm like this is an interesting cultural thing in the US where we're sort of.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-253">Where we're sort of, um, careful about how we offer hand me downs.</p>
<p id="p-254">Do you agree? Yeah, I would agree with that.</p>
<p id="p-255">I may not use the actual word.</p>
<p id="p-256">Hand me downs referring to what I'd like to give the person just talking about growing out of is, is a key vocabulary word today too.</p>
<p id="p-257">Right, This person, my child has grown out of it.</p>
<p id="p-258">I'm gonna donate it.</p>
<p id="p-259">Would you like to check out what I have? Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-260">And that's how it's been.</p>
<p id="p-261">I have a neighbor and, you know, she hasn't said, like, want my hand me downs.</p>
<p id="p-262">It's just, it's like you're devaluing it to call them that.</p>
<p id="p-263">Right, You could say, oh, I've always worn hand me downs.</p>
<p id="p-264">But if you're going to offer used clothing to someone else, I love this way of just being, you know, I have this clothing.</p>
<p id="p-265">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-266">It's a little, it's interesting.</p>
<p id="p-267">Right, Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-268">You, you're devaluing it when you're offering it.</p>
<p id="p-269">But when you talk about it, if someone says, oh, love your jacket, it was a hand me down.</p>
<p id="p-270">I can't believe it.</p>
<p id="p-271">All right.</p>
<p id="p-272">That's ok.</p>
<p id="p-273">That's not devaluing it.</p>
<p id="p-274">Right, Right, It's just a, it's fascinating.</p>
<p id="p-275">Actually, it's very cultural and I'm curious where you guys live? Is it the same?</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-276">Where you guys live.</p>
<p id="p-277">Is it the same or is this, you know, not a part of your culture? You know, how do people look at hand me downs? And I feel like this is different depending on the person as well, depending on if you were raised, using hand me downs or I think some people are raised to maybe spurn them a little bit for sure.</p>
<p id="p-278">And I think especially in our era of fast fashion, we're becoming more aware of the environment.</p>
<p id="p-279">This is a good movement.</p>
<p id="p-280">I think our culture is kind of moving more in the direction of handing down clothing.</p>
<p id="p-281">I think it's good to save the environment because there's so much water, it's used, I mean, not good.</p>
<p id="p-282">Right? Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-283">More and more companies are offering this.</p>
<p id="p-284">I know at H and M there was like a clothing donation bin for a long time and they would make new clothing out of that.</p>
<p id="p-285">They would use the recycled garments to new clothing.</p>
<p id="p-286">So I think that's happening more and more too.</p>
<p id="p-287">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-288">Like you said, Lindsay, as people are more aware of this is so much better for the environment to try to use clothing as much as possible.</p>
<p id="p-289">Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-290">Let's break into a role play here, Aubrey and we are chatting about our shopping habits.</p>
<p id="p-291">Very common conversation.</p>
<p id="p-292">Absolutely.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-293">In conversation, the entire world.</p>
<p id="p-294">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-295">Yes, All right.</p>
<p id="p-296">Let me see.</p>
<p id="p-297">Let me scroll up here.</p>
<p id="p-298">All right.</p>
<p id="p-299">So I haven't found any good second hand clothing shops.</p>
<p id="p-300">Do you know of one? Yeah, there's a good one on Maine.</p>
<p id="p-301">I take our hand me downs there.</p>
<p id="p-302">Oh, I tried that one and was surprised by the prices.</p>
<p id="p-303">Oh, yeah, that's true.</p>
<p id="p-304">They pay a bit for used clothing so they charge more almost the same as seconds as the outlets.</p>
<p id="p-305">So this is interesting.</p>
<p id="p-306">This is, I've seen this a lot too where there's one near us called Urban Exchange where you can take used clothing there and they will pay you for the things that are really good quality.</p>
<p id="p-307">So then of course, when people are buying clothing there, even though it's used clothing, it's a little pricier and they do pay you when you donate to Good or no.</p>
<p id="p-308">Is it just donations at Goodwill? No, it's just donations.</p>
<p id="p-309">Goodwill to places you just donate.</p>
<p id="p-310">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-311">So that's kind of a higher end thrift store.</p>
<p id="p-312">And often it will be sort of newer clothing or brand name clothing because sometimes they'll only purchase those items</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-313">Only purchase those items.</p>
<p id="p-314">So we differentiated here really clearly, right? Between hand me downs and second hand clothing shops, right? I said I haven't found any good second hand clothing shops in town.</p>
<p id="p-315">Do you know of one? Yes, And then I'm saying, I take our hand me downs to this thrift store.</p>
<p id="p-316">But then I share, you know, they pay for some of the things I'm turning in.</p>
<p id="p-317">So that's why they're a little pricier.</p>
<p id="p-318">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-319">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-320">And you're saying they pay a bit for used clothing so they charge more.</p>
<p id="p-321">Makes sense.</p>
<p id="p-322">And then I say almost the same as seconds at the outlets where this is more specific.</p>
<p id="p-323">These are new clothing for some reason are sold at a discount, but they're not second hand, they're not used in this case.</p>
<p id="p-324">The used clothing would be at a similar price point to the second.</p>
<p id="p-325">Right, Wow.</p>
<p id="p-326">Aubrey, what's our takeaway for today? I feel like we're digging into a true connection topic for our listeners.</p>
<p id="p-327">Yes, definitely.</p>
<p id="p-328">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-329">You mentioned how, you know, using second hand clothing is better for the environment.</p>
<p id="p-330">I actually saw this stat by thread up.</p>
<p id="p-331">Did a report that said if ever?</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p id="p-332">Thread up did a report that said if every consumer this year bought one second hand garment instead of a new one that it would lower carbon dioxide emissions by more than 2 billion pounds.</p>
<p id="p-333">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-334">And granted, that's every one of us, right? So, but we can make a difference if we're willing to buy used clothing, use used clothing instead of purchasing new every time.</p>
<p id="p-335">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-336">And honestly sometimes I don't have the best fashion sense.</p>
<p id="p-337">I just kind of don't really think about it.</p>
<p id="p-338">It's not really part of my life that much to think really hard.</p>
<p id="p-339">So sometimes I will go to these used uh clothing, clothing stores to find better fashion ideas because I assume the person that donated it had a better fashion.</p>
<p id="p-340">Somebody owned this.</p>
<p id="p-341">Somebody believed clothing to wear.</p>
<p id="p-342">I'm gonna get it.</p>
<p id="p-343">I love that it's been vetted, right? It's been vetted.</p>
<p id="p-344">But I also love what you said.</p>
<p id="p-345">This is a great way to connect, right? Our Aden and I connected about used books.</p>
<p id="p-346">You can connect about your shopping habits, trends, like you said, Lindsay shopping is always a fun connection topic.</p>
<p id="p-347">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-348">And we are always looking for these connection topics.</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p id="p-349">Always looking for these connection topics.</p>
<p id="p-350">So then we can focus on that exchange with the other person.</p>
<p id="p-351">Focus on getting to know them and how the way they shop reflects who they are.</p>
<p id="p-352">Then we can forget about making mistakes and we can.</p>
<p id="p-353">That's why we're here.</p>
<p id="p-354">Right, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-355">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-356">Yes, absolutely guys.</p>
<p id="p-357">Right, It's all about that connection.</p>
<p id="p-358">I love it.</p>
