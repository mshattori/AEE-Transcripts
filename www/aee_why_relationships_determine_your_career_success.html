<p id="p-18">Hello, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-19">How's it going today?</p>
<p id="p-20">I'm good, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-21">How are you?</p>
<p id="p-22">Excellent.</p>
<p id="p-23">I am so excited for what is happening this week, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-24">It is really exciting and we're going to get into it in just a minute.</p>
<p id="p-25">But first, do you have a question for me?</p>
<p id="p-26">I do.</p>
<p id="p-27">So, Lindsay, I mean, how comfortable are you making</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-28">How comfortable are you making small talk?</p>
<p id="p-29">So I know, for example, you just went to a conference.</p>
<p id="p-30">So there were probably a lot of opportunities for small talk.</p>
<p id="p-31">How do you feel in those situations?</p>
<p id="p-32">Yeah, I usually feel good.</p>
<p id="p-33">I try to go to the common thing that we have in common, right?</p>
<p id="p-34">The thing that we both share as quickly as possible, right?</p>
<p id="p-35">Or commenting on the surroundings.</p>
<p id="p-36">Like, is it cold on the exhibitor floor, right?</p>
<p id="p-37">For example, it was cold in here or something about the weather, what we have in common.</p>
<p id="p-38">What about you, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-39">Yeah, I usually feel pretty good once it starts.</p>
<p id="p-40">Sometimes it's a little bit hard to actually break into that conversation, especially if you see a group of three people talking and you're at the bagel station and they're already talking.</p>
<p id="p-41">To me, that's the more intimidating part, kind of getting into it.</p>
<p id="p-42">But generally you feel fairly comfortable with small talk.</p>
<p id="p-43">And I mean, one of the things that I always like to make sure I'm doing is just continuing the conversation.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-44">Just continuing the conversation, finding ways to continue it, asking questions, not letting things just drop and fall flat, right?</p>
<p id="p-45">Oh, 100%. You always need to, and if we're not focusing on being perfect, we do have mind space to think of ways to continue that conversation.</p>
<p id="p-46">But there are also language patterns, there are techniques and strategies to do that based on what we know about what native speakers actually do.</p>
<p id="p-47">Right, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-48">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-49">And so today we're going to be talking about follow-up questions, and this is really, really important.</p>
<p id="p-50">I mean, this is follow-up questions.</p>
<p id="p-51">What are follow-up questions, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-52">Yeah, I mean, follow-up questions are when someone has said something and made a statement about any topic, what are the additional things where you can keep that thread going?</p>
<p id="p-53">You know, what can you ask to keep the thread going?</p>
<p id="p-54">Yes, Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-55">So this is great to continue the conversation, shows you're interested, keep talking and grow that connection.</p>
<p id="p-56">So that is what we're...</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-57">Yes, So that is what we're going to get into today.</p>
<p id="p-58">But yeah, Lindsay, we wanted to share with our listeners something new and exciting that is available right now.</p>
<p id="p-59">And what is that, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-60">Yes, This week only, specifically this week, guys, we are launching our brand new course, which we have been building since January.</p>
<p id="p-61">It's Professional English Level 1. And Michelle, I'm glad we're talking about small talk because small talk is one of the four topics that we really get into in this course.</p>
<p id="p-62">And the other ones are presentations, interviews, and meetings.</p>
<p id="p-63">We believe that these are the places where we are kind of wanting to focus the most.</p>
<p id="p-64">Our students are able to shine if they're feeling strong and maybe feel the most vulnerable at work if they're not feeling strong with their skills.</p>
<p id="p-65">Right, Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-66">So this is such a great new course and it's launching this week and there is a special deal through April 20th, right?</p>
<p id="p-67">Yes, we're going to save up to 100</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-68">Yes, we're going to save up to $100 off the price of the course, guys, by April 20th.</p>
<p id="p-69">But there are some things that we specifically built into this course that I believe are pretty unique, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-70">Yeah, so what is unique about this course?</p>
<p id="p-71">Yeah, so we built this course to be a level one professional English course.</p>
<p id="p-72">We built in fluency as well as professional communication skills.</p>
<p id="p-73">So most courses out there are either business English or fluency.</p>
<p id="p-74">But this course is actually a combination of both because we believe at the B1, B2 level, you do need fluency and you also need those professional skills.</p>
<p id="p-75">So it's a beautiful blend of both sides of the equation, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-76">Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-77">That is huge.</p>
<p id="p-78">We always talk about how just because you're at business, you're still a person.</p>
<p id="p-79">You're not a robot, right?</p>
<p id="p-80">So we have to make sure that we are not forgetting about the skills that we learn on the fluency side.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-81">learn on the fluency side and how to actually marry those two skills and really build those connections in the business world.</p>
<p id="p-82">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-83">And at the end of the episode, we'll show you guys exactly how you can get this special deal.</p>
<p id="p-84">It's also a great review from anyone in the higher, more advanced levels who wants a review of the fluency.</p>
<p id="p-85">If we're still making those repetitive grammar mistakes, we go through them and we fix them in this course.</p>
<p id="p-86">All right.</p>
<p id="p-87">Definitely.</p>
<p id="p-88">Yeah, So cool.</p>
<p id="p-89">Yeah, So follow-up questions, that's one of the things that we do cover in the course, right?</p>
<p id="p-90">So a follow-up question is searching for more information.</p>
<p id="p-91">It gets the person to expand and doesn't let that conversation just drop or fall flat, like I mentioned before.</p>
<p id="p-92">Yes, And Lindsay, do you think it can be awkward if somebody doesn't ask a follow-up question?</p>
<p id="p-93">Yeah, Michelle, I absolutely do.</p>
<p id="p-94">Especially if you say something important or interesting and they are just kind of quiet, it's very awkward.</p>
<p id="p-95">It's a real...</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-96">awkward.</p>
<p id="p-97">It's a great way to lose the connection fast if you don't. If you just say, oh, I mean, it's over.</p>
<p id="p-98">And that's not what we're here for.</p>
<p id="p-99">And that's not what our listeners want.</p>
<p id="p-100">We know that you guys are global professionals.</p>
<p id="p-101">You want to engage with people.</p>
<p id="p-102">So we don't want to just drop those conversations.</p>
<p id="p-103">Yes, you got it.</p>
<p id="p-104">Yeah, So let's do some examples of follow-up questions.</p>
<p id="p-105">Okay, let's do it, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-106">Actually, no, actually, we're going to play a little bit of a game.</p>
<p id="p-107">So I set up the conversations and then you're going to ask me a follow-up question, but I didn't actually give it to you.</p>
<p id="p-108">Oh, okay.</p>
<p id="p-109">Got it, got it.</p>
<p id="p-110">Perfect.</p>
<p id="p-111">I have to come up with it spontaneously.</p>
<p id="p-112">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-113">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-114">All right.</p>
<p id="p-115">So here we go.</p>
<p id="p-116">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-117">Hey, what did you do this weekend?</p>
<p id="p-118">Oh, I went to Atlantic City for a bachelorette party.</p>
<p id="p-119">Oh my gosh, that's amazing.</p>
<p id="p-120">How did you choose Atlantic City for your bachelorette?</p>
<p id="p-121">Oh, well, it was good because it was not too</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-122">It was good because it was not too far away and there's a lot to do for just a night and we were able to – it was just really easy to get to.</p>
<p id="p-123">Amazing.</p>
<p id="p-124">So did you stay in an Airbnb or a hotel?</p>
<p id="p-125">We stayed in a hotel.</p>
<p id="p-126">It was just three of us actually, but yeah.</p>
<p id="p-127">So we stayed at the Borgata and it was a nice time.</p>
<p id="p-128">Amazing.</p>
<p id="p-129">All right.</p>
<p id="p-130">So there I threw in two follow-up questions and rightfully so.</p>
<p id="p-131">I mean, what would it have sounded like or felt like, Michelle, if I just said, oh, you went on a bachelorette party, right?</p>
<p id="p-132">Nothing.</p>
<p id="p-133">That's a big deal, right?</p>
<p id="p-134">You only go on a bachelorette once in your life, right?</p>
<p id="p-135">Once or twice maybe.</p>
<p id="p-136">So, you know, you need to ask follow-up questions in that moment.</p>
<p id="p-137">That's important.</p>
<p id="p-138">Right, I would have felt very strange if I told you that and there was just nothing.</p>
<p id="p-139">I would have felt like either you weren't paying attention, you were busy, or you were just not interested in talking to me.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-140">We're just not interested in talking to me and we don't want to do that, right?</p>
<p id="p-141">We want to build those connections.</p>
<p id="p-142">I mean, so yeah, you asked me about how did I choose Atlantic City?</p>
<p id="p-143">You asked about where I stayed.</p>
<p id="p-144">There's, I mean, a million things you could have asked.</p>
<p id="p-145">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-146">And that's one of the things that we do in the course.</p>
<p id="p-147">We kind of go through and say, you know, give your response.</p>
<p id="p-148">Like what is something that you could have said and give examples.</p>
<p id="p-149">So it's just huge.</p>
<p id="p-150">And, you know, also in because we're taking this from our conversations with native speakers that you all heard.</p>
<p id="p-151">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-152">Yeah, And that's a really important point, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-153">So in all of our courses, we interview native speakers and we bring you these pre-recorded conversations and the entire lesson, all of the lessons are based on these conversations.</p>
<p id="p-154">And so the original material for the course is you're watching me actually dig into getting to know the person and coming up with follow-up questions spontaneously, right?</p>
<p id="p-155">There weren't any pre-rehearsed follow-up questions because you can't have a pre-rehearsed follow-up.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-156">and have a pre-rehearsed follow-up question that doesn't make any sense because you don't know what the person's gonna say before, right?</p>
<p id="p-157">So you watch it being done naturally, and then we work backwards from that, and we learn our pronunciation, our vocabulary, our grammar, and our listening skills based on those real conversations.</p>
<p id="p-158">That's absolutely right.</p>
<p id="p-159">So let's do another one.</p>
<p id="p-160">Lindsay, you can use the one that I put, or you can do a different one.</p>
<p id="p-161">So Michelle, when I was a kid, I went to a bunch of great concerts.</p>
<p id="p-162">Oh, you did?</p>
<p id="p-163">What were some of your favorites?</p>
<p id="p-164">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-165">One of them was the KISS concert, and I don't mean KISS the group, I mean KISS 108 FM, a radio concert.</p>
<p id="p-166">The coolest concept where radio stations bring together like 100 different artists in one weekend.</p>
<p id="p-167">It's like a mega concert.</p>
<p id="p-168">Yeah, Well, who was there?</p>
<p id="p-169">Do you remember anybody?</p>
<p id="p-170">Well, I think, well, Michelle, we're talking about the early 90s here.</p>
<p id="p-171">Okay, so I think we had Mary J. Blige.</p>
<p id="p-172">I know we had Meatloaf.</p>
<p id="p-173">There were some real like legitimate artists there and all in one place.</p>
<p id="p-174">So it's like a one-stop.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-175">And all in one place.</p>
<p id="p-176">So it's like a one-stop shop.</p>
<p id="p-177">Yeah, Was it good?</p>
<p id="p-178">It was fantastic.</p>
<p id="p-179">I loved it.</p>
<p id="p-180">I was young.</p>
<p id="p-181">I think I was in fourth grade and I thought it was the coolest thing.</p>
<p id="p-182">Yeah, What about you?</p>
<p id="p-183">Have you been to any concerts when you were, or did you go to any concerts as a kid?</p>
<p id="p-184">Oh yeah.</p>
<p id="p-185">Backstreet Boys.</p>
<p id="p-186">Who else?</p>
<p id="p-187">Jason Mraz.</p>
<p id="p-188">I went to a bunch.</p>
<p id="p-189">Yeah, there were, I loved going to concerts as a kid.</p>
<p id="p-190">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-191">Yeah, look at that.</p>
<p id="p-192">So we found some common ground here and there's a lot of directions I could have taken what you're saying.</p>
<p id="p-193">So some of the artists that you're saying remind me of who I listened to in high school and college, right?</p>
<p id="p-194">So we could talk maybe about, we have a little bit of an age gap, Michelle, you and I, so we could talk a little bit about that, right?</p>
<p id="p-195">Different decades.</p>
<p id="p-196">There's so much we could do here, but the point is we need to be free in our minds and know the strategies, the tactics.</p>
<p id="p-197">Michelle, what are some of the tactics just to give our listeners a little hint?</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-198">just to give our listeners a little hint.</p>
<p id="p-199">Well, basically, I mean, you're hanging on to one of the more important things that I said, and you're just thinking of like, you know, you could ask things like, how did you like it?</p>
<p id="p-200">What did you do?</p>
<p id="p-201">How was it?</p>
<p id="p-202">Right, Just like kind of like clinging onto one part and getting them to elaborate.</p>
<p id="p-203">I like the way you said that, hanging on.</p>
<p id="p-204">Don't think that you have to come up with some brilliant new topic.</p>
<p id="p-205">Hang on to the last thing they said because this makes them feel heard.</p>
<p id="p-206">It makes them, you know, the concept we've said on the show before, be interested to be interesting, be interested in others, and then you become interesting to them, right?</p>
<p id="p-207">And so hang on to what they said and expand from that.</p>
<p id="p-208">But my general advice here is go for open-ended questions, not yes or nos, right?</p>
<p id="p-209">Open-ended, right, right.</p>
<p id="p-210">That's good.</p>
<p id="p-211">That's a good tip.</p>
<p id="p-212">All right, Michelle, we are back.</p>
<p id="p-213">Where do we go from here?</p>
<p id="p-214">Okay, well, we talked so much about</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-215">Okay, well we talked so much about keeping conversations going in the Professional English Level 1 course that just came out.</p>
<p id="p-216">Guys, this course is brand new.</p>
<p id="p-217">And as we kind of hinted at, you are going to hear interviews with native speakers in this course.</p>
<p id="p-218">And Lindsay, in Module 7, we talk about socializing and small talk, and that's going to prepare you for these important conversations and for building the connections with people.</p>
<p id="p-219">So we have exercises where you have to pick the follow-up question.</p>
<p id="p-220">It's just really, really useful.</p>
<p id="p-221">Anything else you want to add about that, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-222">Yeah, I think there's some real value to legitimately drilling a skill.</p>
<p id="p-223">And in this course, we do drill.</p>
<p id="p-224">This course is our most, our deepest course in terms of practice activities, right?</p>
<p id="p-225">We really drill into each skill, and each skill has two or three or four exercises where you're not just learning the theory, you're actually really practicing the skill.</p>
<p id="p-226">And I think that's what you're going to see as the difference.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-227">That's what you're going to see as the difference between this and other things that we've done in the past.</p>
<p id="p-228">And so I think this is absolutely going to build that fluency base for our listeners who maybe feel shaky in terms of fluency.</p>
<p id="p-229">I mean, yes, you can go and learn how to write an email, you can build business skills, but if you don't have fluency, the business skills are going to fly out the window in the high pressure moments.</p>
<p id="p-230">Right, Right, Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-231">I think that is so important, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-232">So, you know, just with follow up questions, I mean, just remember to pick up on one thing that person says, like Lindsay said, and I like this idea is, you know, you don't need to always be searching for new topics, dig deep into the one topic and find more ways to ask questions.</p>
<p id="p-233">I mean, one thing I thought of is if you want to practice this, an additional way would be to write down a statement of your own and then think of what you would like someone to ask you to get you to talk more about it.</p>
<p id="p-234">Because actually the person on the other end, they might want you to ask certain questions.</p>
<p id="p-235">They want to share.</p>
<p id="p-236">They want to, you know.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-237">they want to get deeper into it.</p>
<p id="p-238">So, if you think about what would I like to be asked, that can help you maybe think about how to relate to others.</p>
<p id="p-239">I love that, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-240">That's a really nice drill that every single one of our listeners can do right now when we get off the episode.</p>
<p id="p-241">What would you like someone to ask you?</p>
<p id="p-242">And the other thing you can do is a mind experiment.</p>
<p id="p-243">In your next conversation, imagine that you can't come up with another topic.</p>
<p id="p-244">Like, you don't have the option.</p>
<p id="p-245">We're restricting you to staying on what the person just said.</p>
<p id="p-246">You don't have the option to bail and jump around.</p>
<p id="p-247">We've done episodes on the show before about, like, topic hopping and how it can feel like whiplash.</p>
<p id="p-248">Do you remember that episode we did, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-249">Or was that me and Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-250">I can't remember.</p>
<p id="p-251">I'm not sure, but yeah.</p>
<p id="p-252">Yeah, that's funny, though.</p>
<p id="p-253">It's true.</p>
<p id="p-254">It's too much.</p>
<p id="p-255">And people topic hop because maybe they feel nervous.</p>
<p id="p-256">I do this.</p>
<p id="p-257">I do this when I'm talking to someone who I'm nervous to talk with, I topic hop because I think my topics aren't good enough, right?</p>
<p id="p-258">I will admit.</p>
<p id="p-259">And so what if you had to stay on the last thing they said and you have</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-260">The last thing they said, and you have to come up with a follow-up question.</p>
<p id="p-261">Imagine that with a thought experiment.</p>
<p id="p-262">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-263">That's fun.</p>
<p id="p-264">I like it.</p>
<p id="p-265">Yeah, that's really good.</p>
<p id="p-266">That's a good idea.</p>
<p id="p-267">So should we do a role play?</p>
<p id="p-268">Yeah, let's do it.</p>
<p id="p-269">So here, Michelle, we are acquaintances, and we're at a team dinner sitting next to each other.</p>
<p id="p-270">So are we teammates at work, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-271">Yes, but we don't know each other that well.</p>
<p id="p-272">Got it.</p>
<p id="p-273">We work in different departments, maybe different floors of the company.</p>
<p id="p-274">Okay, cool.</p>
<p id="p-275">All right.</p>
<p id="p-276">So do you have any trips planned for the summer?</p>
<p id="p-277">Yeah, actually, I do.</p>
<p id="p-278">Where to?</p>
<p id="p-279">Oh, well, we're going to Vegas.</p>
<p id="p-280">Oh, wow, fun.</p>
<p id="p-281">Have you been before?</p>
<p id="p-282">Yeah, actually, once.</p>
<p id="p-283">Wow, where are you staying?</p>
<p id="p-284">Oh, at the MGM.</p>
<p id="p-285">Oh, great.</p>
<p id="p-286">I hope you got a nice deal.</p>
<p id="p-287">Oh, yeah, we lucked out.</p>
<p id="p-288">So exciting.</p>
<p id="p-289">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-290">Yeah, the thing about those Vegas hotels, I don't know if this is true anymore, actually, but it used to be that you could get a pretty cheap hotel room because they want you to spend your money gambling.</p>
<p id="p-291">Right,</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-292">you to spend your money gambling, right?</p>
<p id="p-293">Yeah, the gambling is just downstairs on the first floor of the hotel.</p>
<p id="p-294">Right, Yep, yep, yep, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-295">So have you been to Vegas, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-296">Yeah, I've stayed in the MGM.</p>
<p id="p-297">I was in Vegas to see Adele last year or the year before that.</p>
<p id="p-298">I've done a couple trips to Vegas.</p>
<p id="p-299">I got to say, it's not my favorite place in the world, but people love it.</p>
<p id="p-300">People love Vegas.</p>
<p id="p-301">I can't argue.</p>
<p id="p-302">All right, so let's go through it.</p>
<p id="p-303">So if it would have been, okay, how weird would it have been?</p>
<p id="p-304">I don't want to use the word weird, but let's just do it.</p>
<p id="p-305">If you said, do you have any trips this summer?</p>
<p id="p-306">And I said, yeah, actually I do.</p>
<p id="p-307">And then you said, oh, great.</p>
<p id="p-308">So or like, oh, great.</p>
<p id="p-309">What do you think about the weather today?</p>
<p id="p-310">Yeah, like, and you're just changing the topic.</p>
<p id="p-311">No, you have to ask.</p>
<p id="p-312">So what was your follow-up question?</p>
<p id="p-313">Yeah, and so I said, where to?</p>
<p id="p-314">And I want our listeners to write this down.</p>
<p id="p-315">Guys, write this down.</p>
<p id="p-316">This is a very natural construction.</p>
<p id="p-317">Instead of saying,</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p id="p-318">instruction.</p>
<p id="p-319">Instead of saying, where are you going or where will you travel to?</p>
<p id="p-320">I just said, where to?</p>
<p id="p-321">And this is incredibly native and natural.</p>
<p id="p-322">Yeah, And I just, I also want to say is don't feel like your questions need to be these lengthy, long follow-up questions.</p>
<p id="p-323">Monologue, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-324">Right, Just where to?</p>
<p id="p-325">Oh, where are you going?</p>
<p id="p-326">You know, nothing crazy.</p>
<p id="p-327">Just they can be short questions.</p>
<p id="p-328">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-329">Remember, it's about them, right?</p>
<p id="p-330">Your journey here is getting to know that person.</p>
<p id="p-331">I'm actually kind of envisioning potentially we could be at a conference and, you know, sometimes when you go to a conference, companies bring teams, but maybe you don't necessarily know each other.</p>
<p id="p-332">So you have an opportunity to get to know this person.</p>
<p id="p-333">You're doing a team dinner, company dinner at the conference.</p>
<p id="p-334">So that's a situation our listeners might find themselves in, right?</p>
<p id="p-335">Definitely, definitely.</p>
<p id="p-336">And then I said, we're going to Vegas.</p>
<p id="p-337">And then what was your,</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p id="p-338">We're going to Vegas.</p>
<p id="p-339">And then what was your follow-up?</p>
<p id="p-340">I said, wow, fun.</p>
<p id="p-341">Have you been before?</p>
<p id="p-342">That's a very obvious question, right?</p>
<p id="p-343">But it's not a boring question.</p>
<p id="p-344">It's a good question.</p>
<p id="p-345">Yeah, of course.</p>
<p id="p-346">And then I said, yes, actually once.</p>
<p id="p-347">And you asked, where are you staying?</p>
<p id="p-348">That's interesting that I asked that in the role play.</p>
<p id="p-349">And I also asked that when you talked about Atlantic City earlier.</p>
<p id="p-350">Was that Atlantic City?</p>
<p id="p-351">Yeah, that's true.</p>
<p id="p-352">Yeah, and that was our unrehearsed one.</p>
<p id="p-353">Unrehearsed one.</p>
<p id="p-354">So clearly, guys, write this down too.</p>
<p id="p-355">It's a common question when someone's going on a trip.</p>
<p id="p-356">Find out about their—imagine them in this new place.</p>
<p id="p-357">What is their setup going to be?</p>
<p id="p-358">A big piece of that is shelter.</p>
<p id="p-359">Like, where are they staying?</p>
<p id="p-360">They're going to have a different experience at an Airbnb versus a hotel.</p>
<p id="p-361">And especially in Vegas, people have a thing with Vegas hotels.</p>
<p id="p-362">It's like a whole thing.</p>
<p id="p-363">I don't know what it is, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-364">But each hotel has a reputation.</p>
<p id="p-365">And the hotels are kind of—they have themes.</p>
<p id="p-366">So that's a whole sub-conversation.</p>
<h2>Part-21</h2>
<p id="p-367">That's just a whole sub-conversation that's kind of common around Vegas trips, don't you think?</p>
<p id="p-368">Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-369">I think that to me, the hotels are the best part.</p>
<p id="p-370">I mean, it's just so fun to go hotel hopping, go around, see what they have.</p>
<p id="p-371">And that is, I mean, I like Vegas.</p>
<p id="p-372">It's not like my favorite place, but to me, the best part is the hotels.</p>
<p id="p-373">Yeah, I mean, and everyone has opinions about each hotel.</p>
<p id="p-374">So especially when someone says they're going to Vegas, this is a go-to question.</p>
<p id="p-375">But any trip really, you want to know what's their accommodation going to look like.</p>
<p id="p-376">Therefore, you get a sense of their trip.</p>
<p id="p-377">Okay?</p>
<p id="p-378">Yes, Good point.</p>
<p id="p-379">Yeah, And then this last one was not, it's interesting, it wasn't a question.</p>
<p id="p-380">You just said, I hope you got a nice deal, right?</p>
<p id="p-381">So it's not a question, but it was still a follow-up.</p>
<p id="p-382">So just something to think about is, you know, you're kind of leading me, even though it wasn't a question, it's a question in a way because you're still getting me to expand.</p>
<p id="p-383">And you could have just said, oh, did you get a good deal?</p>
<h2>Part-22</h2>
<p id="p-384">Oh, did you get a good deal?</p>
<p id="p-385">But you phrased it in a different way.</p>
<p id="p-386">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-387">And I love that because I could have pivoted if maybe I didn't get a good deal.</p>
<p id="p-388">I could have said, yeah, yeah, and what about you?</p>
<p id="p-389">What are you doing next weekend?</p>
<p id="p-390">Or I don't know, I could have pivoted and changed the topic completely.</p>
<p id="p-391">I don't have to, yes, tell you what kind of a deal I got, right?</p>
<p id="p-392">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-393">Yeah, exactly, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-394">And then I would probably start asking you, right?</p>
<p id="p-395">So I'm talking about yours and then either we would continue on talking about Vegas, getting deeper into it, or I would say, oh, are you going anywhere?</p>
<p id="p-396">What about you, right?</p>
<p id="p-397">Yes, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-398">And I think what we're getting at here is at All There's English, we believe in connection, not perfection.</p>
<p id="p-399">And what that translates into in the business world is relationships.</p>
<p id="p-400">Relationships are the basis of your career success, don't you think, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-401">Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-402">You got to get close with people, got to get to know them.</p>
<p id="p-403">Yeah, that's why we built a good portion, not all of it, but a good chunk of</p>
<h2>Part-23</h2>
<p id="p-404">portion, not all of it, but a good chunk of this course is devoted to socializing, small talk, coming up with follow-up questions.</p>
<p id="p-405">You'll witness it in my conversations with the different native speakers.</p>
<p id="p-406">We interview native speakers in sales, finance, engineering, product design and marketing, so many different industries.</p>
<p id="p-407">It is super cool.</p>
<p id="p-408">So, Michelle, what should our listeners know this week?</p>
<p id="p-409">All right.</p>
<p id="p-410">So, well, guys, you can join the brand new Professional English Level 1 course.</p>

<p id="p-413">Right, Lindsay?</p>

<p id="p-421">That's P-R-O-F-E-S-S-I-O-N-A-L. Yes, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-422">And is there any final takeaway for today, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-423">I think think about building those relationships and how you don't want to let somebody who was excited to share something just kind of say, oh, okay, I guess that person wasn't interested, right?</p>
<p id="p-424">Try some of those exercises we talked about in the course.</p>
<p id="p-425">You're definitely going to get a ton of practice in it.</p>
<p id="p-426">But yeah, try this in your own life and think about what you would want to be asked as well.</p>
<p id="p-427">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-428">Your success in your career is based on your relationships.</p>
<p id="p-429">This has been found over and over in studies.</p>
<p id="p-430">And when you talk to people, if you sit down and ask someone how they got to where they are, let's say they're in a C-suite, they'll look back and they'll say, oh, it was that</p>
<h2>Part-25</h2>
<p id="p-431">They'll look back and they'll say, oh, it was that relationship, it was that relationship, it was that connection.</p>
<p id="p-432">Right?</p>
<p id="p-433">Yeah, it led me to the next thing, to the next thing, to the next, yep.</p>
<p id="p-434">It's always about people.</p>
<p id="p-435">And that's what we're about here at All Ears English.</p>
<p id="p-436">This is a huge part of this course.</p>
