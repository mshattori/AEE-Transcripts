<p>Hey there, Michelle.</p>
<p>How's it going today? How are you feeling? I'm feeling good.</p>
<p>How are you? Good.</p>
<p>I'm excited to talk about reading and books.</p>
<p>I am too.</p>
<p>Do you read a lot? You know what? I read a lot of news on my phone but I just started a new book, a new novel.</p>
<p>Um, it's actually, it's, it's good.</p>
<p>It's a really good, it's called, what's, what is the, what it's about, um, the war in Sudan, a boy in Sudan.</p>
<p>Uh, it's sad.</p>
<p>Um, but it's really good.</p>
<p>It's really well written.</p>
<p>So I've been getting back into novels, you know, before bed, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>So, aren't you starting to put your phone outside of your room? Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Still doing that.</p>
<p>And it's really good.</p>
<p>It feels great to not, it's like in my mind phones and bed do not mix anymore.</p>
<p>So, for you, that is, that is quite an accomplishment.</p>
<p>I have to say.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>Accomplishment.</p>
<p>I have to.</p>
<p>It's actually not as hard as I thought since I got it.</p>
<p>The problem was when I was using my alarm clock on the phone, that was hard, right? Because then you need your phone for the alarm.</p>
<p>But if you use another a new alarm clock, right, it all works together.</p>
<p>So I'm super excited Michelle to talk about books today because today we are doing part one of a mini series and this has started because a listener asked us a really great question about a very popular expression.</p>
<p>So guys, this is part one of the series.</p>
<p>Now, the second part is not going to be on the all ears English part podcast, Lindsay, where is it going to be? The second part is going to be over on Business English.</p>
<p>Our other podcast guys, it's going to be on there later in the week.</p>
<p>So if you want to complete the series, close the loop, right.</p>
<p>Go over open in your search bar Business English podcast, you will see the yellow and you can go and hit that follow button.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>And you can go and hit that follow button so you can get the second episode in the series later this week.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So this question today comes to us.</p>
<p>This was from youtube guys.</p>
<p>You can ask your questions over there.</p>
<p>So this is from Hena.</p>
<p>3155.</p>
<p>Would you like to read the question, Lindsay? Yes, here's the question.</p>
<p>I definitely would like you to share some classic expressions with us.</p>
<p>One of the expressions I learned before is you can't judge a book by its cover.</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>It's a good one, Michelle.</p>
<p>It's a very good one.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm excited to talk about this today, Lindsay.</p>
<p>What does that mean? Uh I mean, it basically means if you think about books or many things in life, you can't judge them in their quality or substance based on what you see on the superficial level on the surface, right? Based on the cover.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yes, Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Um</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Um So yeah, it's your perception from the beginning.</p>
<p>Um Lindsay, do you try and live by this philosophy? Of course.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And many times you learn, I think, I think that it is very human to judge.</p>
<p>I mean, it comes back to our evolutionary brains, right? When we were protecting ourselves from the tiger in caves, we made snap judgments.</p>
<p>Is this person, is this animal safe, right? Um But now we live normal lives and it actually, I, I still see my mind doing this, right? Everyone does, of course.</p>
<p>But then life always corrects me.</p>
<p>It's never what I imagined at the beginning, the person or the situation.</p>
<p>It is true.</p>
<p>I mean, can you, I mean, I'm sure we've all done this where we have judged something by its cover and then actually realized we were wrong.</p>
<p>Um But I think, yeah, as, as I've gotten older, I have learned to take my time with how I pursue.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>Take my time with how I perceive things.</p>
<p>Um I don't want to be harsh to judge or harsh to react.</p>
<p>I try to be a little, just breathe a little bit.</p>
<p>I think I talked about this recently, you know, with, with moving, um just you don't know who is going to be your next best friend and maybe you meet someone and you wouldn't even think or you realize and then all of a sudden you realize, wait a second, this person is, we got pretty close.</p>
<p>So, you know, just for so many things in life, it's so true and imagine if we do judge and then we cut off opportunities to know people or to try things that how much we would lose of the richness of life.</p>
<p>Right? So it's just a great saying and it still continues to be true.</p>
<p>Right? And, and more in the book sense, right? It comes from this idea of, do you ever see a book and, and you're just looking and you think it has a beautiful cover.</p>
<p>Some books, their covers are</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>Beautiful cover.</p>
<p>Some books, their covers are really beautiful and then you want to read them and then they might not always be that good or maybe a book has a boring cover and it's the best book you've ever read.</p>
<p>So do you, when you are deciding to read an actual book, we're talking more literally.</p>
<p>Now, do you judge a book by its cover? Do you let the cover you? No, I try to get title ideas from smart people.</p>
<p>People that have similar interests and recommendations their entire, that just do book recommendations and reviews, right? You get there from any newspapers you read.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, I think like I said, the human mind judges even just colors.</p>
<p>We create an association with a color.</p>
<p>I mean, yellow is the color of energy, at least in the US.</p>
<p>But this could be cultural too yellow.</p>
<p>Our color is the color of energy, enthusiasm, excitement.</p>
<p>And that actually reflects who we are, which is great.</p>
<p>But you know, other people might have different colors associated.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>Other people might have different colors associated with their brand that might be attracting or detracting people.</p>
<p>Right, Fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is interesting.</p>
<p>I do think I am a little bit guilty of with, with an actual book looking for the best cover.</p>
<p>There was this book.</p>
<p>I never ended up having time to read it, but I remember it had the most beautiful color I had ever seen and I just, you know, you get excited sometimes I'll have books at home and then I see a pretty cover outside at a bookstore and I think, oh, I want to read that, but I have these books at home.</p>
<p>So that's hilarious.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>Uh anyway, today though, we are going to share some more idioms dealing with books.</p>
<p>So I'm excited for this one and like we said, there's going to be part two of these because there's a lot of good ones that you can use in business.</p>
<p>Um So definitely look, listen out for that.</p>
<p>I'm curious what comes out in the business episode too.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p>So Lindsay, what's the first one today?</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>What's the first one today? All right.</p>
<p>So this one is good.</p>
<p>This one is modern.</p>
<p>I hear this a lot, an open book.</p>
<p>This is basically someone who's comfortable expressing themselves.</p>
<p>They are open to sharing things that maybe not everyone would share.</p>
<p>I feel like usually people will say this about themselves.</p>
<p>Right, Right, So somebody might say something, like, ask me all about it.</p>
<p>I'm an open book.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's so true.</p>
<p>I think I feel like you wouldn't ask.</p>
<p>Are you an open book? No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Well, I'm about to ask you that you ask me now.</p>
<p>That's fine.</p>
<p>Literally, that's what I have weird conversations.</p>
<p>It's a weird, it is true.</p>
<p>You want to ask somebody this but if you're an English teacher, you exactly.</p>
<p>Do you consider yourself? Are you someone who likes to share things or do you keep, I think I'm pretty, I'm pretty shy.</p>
<p>Um, I</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>Um I do, I don't really have that much shame in things like different circumstances that are going on.</p>
<p>And I like to connect and, well, obviously, you can't be tone deaf in the sense that you need to make sure you're sharing the right thing with the right person, right at the right time.</p>
<p>But I think if we share a little something that's going on in our lives, we can get closer to people, which is great, you know.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I, I don't think that we could be, we could be in our jobs if we were at open books.</p>
<p>Right? And I think that maybe that's one of the things I hope people alike about the show is that we're not just teaching, we're sharing about ourselves, we're sharing our thoughts, right? We're open books.</p>
<p>Well, it is true.</p>
<p>I mean, when we first launched our podcast back in 2013, I felt like looking at all the other E S L podcasts, it was the opposite.</p>
<p>Everyone was kind of just very professional and buttoned up and serious, but this is not a serious thing, right? Of course, we want to improve, but we want to have fun and we want to connect because that's.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>And we want to connect because that's what conversation and communication is about.</p>
<p>So we decided to do things a bit differently here.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And speaking of open books, we are gonna be asking you guys a question on our Spotify poll today.</p>
<p>Um So stay tuned till the end because we've been doing these really fun polls, right? Lindsay, where we ask the question and then we're able to interact with our listeners on Spotify.</p>
<p>So please listen to the end because we're going to be sharing that Paul.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So cool.</p>
<p>Is there another phrase regarding books, Michelle that we need to? Yes, this is in my book.</p>
<p>Yeah, this one's really good in my book.</p>
<p>So that's how you see things.</p>
<p>It's almost as if we all have our own books that are not real, but it's your set of rules, how you see things, how you perceive, perceive things.</p>
<p>What's OK? What's not? OK, Um Lindsay.</p>
<p>So what's an example here? OK, So here's a sample sentence in my</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>OK, So here's a sample sentence in my book.</p>
<p>It's wrong to ask someone for a favor when you have no intention of returning it.</p>
<p>So, this is a really useful phrase to kind of assert your values.</p>
<p>Right, Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>To show, to show what you believe in who you are and share what interject a little bit about what you think is maybe right or wrong.</p>
<p>100% 100%.</p>
<p>And it's good to, there are moments when we need to be able to do that, we kind of want to own what we believe.</p>
<p>And so this is useful.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Now let's go to the university halls, the college dormitories hit the books, hit the books, books.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So, yeah, to hit the books.</p>
<p>It doesn't mean you're physically going up to the books and smacking them.</p>
<p>You might be, who knows.</p>
<p>Maybe, I mean, maybe if you're really frustrated, um, hit the books is to me means to study, to do your work.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter how tired we are, we</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>It doesn't matter how tired we are, we have to hit the books.</p>
<p>The exam is in three days.</p>
<p>Michelle.</p>
<p>Do you remember in college you had what they call it like reading week or something like that where you had a time to prepare for your exams? Did you not get that? Was it just, I don't think we called it re Reading week.</p>
<p>I think we just, oh, I, oh, that does sound familiar.</p>
<p>I don't know if it was called Reading Week.</p>
<p>But, yeah, I do know about that exam prep week.</p>
<p>Maybe it was called prep week.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think they might have called that, that in my school because my school is a little bit traditional Southern.</p>
<p>So, maybe that's what they used to call it back in the day.</p>
<p>I remember everyone, you just get a full week or three or four days to just study and prepare for that and then the exams start to come.</p>
<p>Right, Um, and it really helps for exams if you're book smart.</p>
<p>Right, Yeah, it for sure helps.</p>
<p>Not necessarily in life but, but in, but in exams, so being book smart is the opposite of street smart.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>Smart is the opposite of street smart, right? So she's very book smart, but she's not very savvy when it comes to getting around town and learning about the culture of a new place.</p>
<p>Yeah, and this is going to be linked to our poll for today.</p>
<p>It is, it is Lindsay.</p>
<p>So yeah, this idea of book smart or street smart, I think ideally people have some of both but sometimes people are very in want more in one or the other.</p>
<p>Um I think it more so happens that somebody may be very book smart but not very street smart, right? For sure, for sure.</p>
<p>So what do you think about yourself? Not brilliant either way, but I have a little bit of both enough to get, let's just say enough to get by on both sides.</p>
<p>You're so funny.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, thanks Michelle.</p>
<p>What about you? What, what, where do you lean? Which direction do you lean in? Um I would say I'm more.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>I would say I'm more street smart but I'm enough book smart also to get by.</p>
<p>Um, you know, I was able to, able to graduate from school my program and do well, but I wouldn't say I would, there are some people that they are able to do well with, not even putting in that much work because they are, they have this natural sense of being book smart.</p>
<p>I, not that way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>I understand that.</p>
<p>I studied a lot in college too.</p>
<p>But no, it's true.</p>
<p>I mean, I think in, in adult life you learn, I think when you're in school you think it's all about grades and it is when you're in school, of course.</p>
<p>But then you hit adult life and you realize you only need a certain amount of natural intelligence, then you can fill in the gaps, right? Just learning on your own.</p>
<p>And then it's really all about navigating life, which is street smart.</p>
<p>How do you talk to people? How do you navigate, uh, a city? Like, how do you adapt to</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>A city like how do you adapt to cultures? Right, This is more street smarts in a way.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So, well, this leads us to our Spotify poll.</p>
<p>So guys listen in.</p>
<p>So the question is, are you more book smart or street smart? Um So you have to choose one.</p>
<p>We could put in a little bit of both, but that's too easy.</p>
<p>It's not fair that we didn't, we didn't change about it.</p>
<p>We're asking our listeners, but that's ok.</p>
<p>We'll see what our listeners have to say for me.</p>
<p>If I had to answer the call, I would say Street smart.</p>
<p>Street smart.</p>
<p>Street smart.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>What would you say? It's really hard, I guess, I guess, I guess street smart too, Michelle.</p>
<p>I guess that's the same.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>More of a, like a wisdom about life, I guess is probably, yeah.</p>
<p>So now that we've answered, you have to answer two and pick one.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love it.</p>
<p>Let's go into a role play and then our listeners can go and do that poll and we will announce the role</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p>And we will announce the results in a few episodes.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Here, Michelle.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So here we are study partners at school.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So, all right.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So are you ready to hit the books? Oh, yeah, I guess I don't love studying.</p>
<p>I'm not very book smart naturally.</p>
<p>Like you can do it in my book.</p>
<p>Anyone can get good grades with a proper studying.</p>
<p>I'll help you.</p>
<p>Oh, thanks.</p>
<p>And really you can ask my help or my advice anytime I'm an open book.</p>
<p>Oh, I appreciate that.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I seem like a partier but you can't judge a book by its cover.</p>
<p>I'm really just into studying and getting good grades.</p>
<p>Oh, is that true? All right.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>So, what did I say here, Michelle first, you said? Ok.</p>
<p>So are you ready to hit the books? And you could have said, are you ready to study? But instead you chose this? Right? And again, we're not physically.</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p>This, right? And again, we're not physically hitting any books.</p>
<p>So we're just, we're not being violent here.</p>
<p>Yes, we're going hard on studying were harmed in the making of that idiot.</p>
<p>Don't harm the books.</p>
<p>Yes, And then you said, yes, I don't love studying.</p>
<p>I'm not very book smart naturally and you are now being very excited to motivate me.</p>
<p>And he said you can do it in my book.</p>
<p>Anyone can get good grades with the proper studying.</p>
<p>So it's basically in your philosophy, in your mind, in my opinion, in my way of seeing the world.</p>
<p>This is a really good one.</p>
<p>Guys, I feel like if you take away anything from today's episode, take away this one because this could bring your connection moments to another level if you can state your opinion in a unique way like this in my book X Y Z.</p>
<p>And it shares a lot about who you are, right? And what if when you use this, you're giving someone a little bit of an insight into how you think and you could use this to talk about</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p>And you could use this to talk about politics, right? And the politics season is heating up right now.</p>
<p>You could talk about politics and talk about what's happening in family dynamics, your opinions about so many things, Michelle it could be used for.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And then, uh you said you can ask my help or advice anytime I'm an open book.</p>
<p>Yes, I'm an open book.</p>
<p>That means I'm totally up for talking about what's going on in my life.</p>
<p>And then you said, I know.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, I said, I know.</p>
<p>I seem like a partier but you can't judge a book by its cover, right? So, so guys, of course, we might not use all of these in 11 conversation like this, but this gives you a pretty good idea of how they're all used.</p>
<p>Yeah, 100% 100%.</p>
<p>So, Michelle, any final takeaways for our listeners today? Anything they should keep in mind.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, this is a</p>
<h2>Part-21</h2>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, this is a, it was a great question and that's why we are going to do the second part of this series on the Business English Podcast.</p>
<p>So again, remember to follow that.</p>
<p>So you get that episode when it comes out.</p>
<p>Um Overall, I just think these expressions are great for connection.</p>
<p>Um especially things like in my book.</p>
<p>I'm an open book.</p>
<p>These are, it's interesting how all of them use, how we've used this word book to mean so much about ourselves, actually.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is really interesting.</p>
<p>So guys try one of these on your own in your next conversation with a native speaker and go open your search bar, find business English podcast hit.</p>
