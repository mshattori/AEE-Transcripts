<p>In English, sometimes you want to talk about an old movie that has not stood the test of time.</p>
<p>Listen in today to have this discussion on whether certain</p>
<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p>this discussion on whether certain kinds of media are still acceptable or relevant today.</p>
<p>Co-Pilot Plus PC, the fastest and most high-performance Windows PC ever.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>although, you know, for example, even Good Will Hunting, there's a few things in there that haven't, that didn't stand the test of time.</p>
<p>It's not that much, but there's a few comments that are made in there that wouldn't pass now.</p>
<p>You know, that's one of my favorite old movies.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Yeah, What about, what about you, Michelle?</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, Well, you and I were just saying that, you know, there are certain movies where they dissect it many years later and they say, oh, now this wouldn't be okay to do, or it just didn't stand the test of time.</p>
<p>We were talking about Love Actually.</p>
<p>Um, there are definitely things about Love Actually that didn't stand the test of time, but we still love it.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just, you don't have to abandon everything you like.</p>
<p>Right, And it's a personal choice.</p>
<p>We all have different choices of which movies we just don't watch anymore.</p>
<p>Um, and then which ones we can kind of look past it.</p>
<p>It just depends, right?</p>
<p>It just depends.</p>
<p>But this is an interesting topic today, Michelle, what are we talking about?</p>
<p>Yeah, Well, I'm excited.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>Yeah, well, I'm excited about this one because recently on another episode I think I think this came up because we were talking about the movie My Cousin Vinny and yes We said that it did stand the test of time.</p>
<p>Are we still going with that?</p>
<p>Well, I haven't watched it recently I mean it so I feel like this could be defined in a couple of different ways I think when we were talking about My Cousin Vinny, we weren't taught we weren't saying it doesn't have any crude comments That would not pass today.</p>
<p>I think we were saying it's still funny.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>right it's kind of like art can also become did the art of comedy can change and what was funny in the 80s regardless of Any crudeness if it was just plain humor could not be that funny anymore.</p>
<p>Do you know what I mean it?</p>
<p>well, I mean, yeah, there are there are definitely shows that my parents have shown me and that I They're excited to show me and it's funny and I might not have the same reaction that they did because we're changes over time Changes it becomes more sophisticated I think or just different</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>I think or just different styles of humor, right?</p>
<p>Becoming style.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>And my parents might not find certain things funny that I find funny because maybe they're just used to a certain style.</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, maybe they would all the Instagram videos, the memes and stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe they wouldn't find that funny because it's just totally different, you know, right?</p>
<p>It's different.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>So yeah, you're right.</p>
<p>This does have a couple different meanings.</p>
<p>So we can kind of touch on them a little bit today.</p>
<p>And today we're going to talk about what this means, how you can use it, and other expressions that you can use in your conversations to connect about this very universal and interesting topic, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, because we've talked about how important it is to be able to refer to movies, quotes from movies, references, music, movies, things like that.</p>
<p>We also need to know how to talk about this topic.</p>
<p>If you quote a movie, and then it might it might bleed into a conversation around, oh, it really hasn't stood the test of time.</p>
<p>I can't believe they said this or this.</p>
<p>You want to be able to say something there, right?</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>to say something there, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But before we get into that, we really want to say thank you so much to our reviewers.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, we love your reviews, guys.</p>
<p>Keep them coming.</p>
<p>When we see your review, we try to read your name out loud on the show.</p>
<p>So I'm going to read the name of Jock Hank from Japan on November 7th, an Apple podcast.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>And an amazing five star review from GTX 7248 in Taiwan, an Apple podcast.</p>
<p>They said, thank you for creating such a fantastic podcast.</p>
<p>Your lessons really helped me to improve my English.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And this listener asked a great question, which has now been sent to our team to build an episode based on that question.</p>
<p>So guys, you can ask your question in your review, but leave us a review right now.</p>
<p>Tell us what you think of All Ears English, whether it's in the iOS Android app or whether it's in Apple podcasts or Spotify or even YouTube.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>or Spotify or even YouTube.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Definitely love it.</p>
<p>So thank you so much.</p>
<p>So Lindsay, we already touched on the little bit to say something stand the test of time.</p>
<p>It means it's still good.</p>
<p>It's still popular or significant in some way years later.</p>
<p>So again, this could go for many things.</p>
<p>So we talked about humor.</p>
<p>It could go for anything in entertainment, music, TV shows, movies, style, even fashion, home decor, hair.</p>
<p>We've talked about that stuff a lot on the show as well.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>What looks good.</p>
<p>If you cringe when you see your old photos or not, right?</p>
<p>It stands the test of time.</p>
<p>For sure, for sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, right now I'm for some reason on a, this is us binge, you know, the show, this is us.</p>
<p>Oh, of course.</p>
<p>Lindsay, we have to talk about that.</p>
<p>Wait, have you already watched the whole thing?</p>
<p>I was not like an early adopter of this is us.</p>
<p>I'm just discovering it now.</p>
<p>This is what I do.</p>
<p>I discovered shows 10 years later.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>shows 10 years later.</p>
<p>But they have so many episodes and I've had a lot of time in the last couple of weeks, so I've been able to catch up, right?</p>
<p>And yeah, it really resonates with me just because I am the exact age of those kids.</p>
<p>I was born in 81, and so I think these kids are like born in 82 or something.</p>
<p>So they went through the same life stages.</p>
<p>The fashion was exactly the same.</p>
<p>Everything was the same.</p>
<p>So that's why that resonates for me.</p>
<p>Yeah, Okay.</p>
<p>Well, we have to talk about this show when we get off the mic.</p>
<p>Sure, we should.</p>
<p>I mean, do you think that that show, This Is Us, stands the test of time at this point?</p>
<p>I mean, it's only been out for what, 10 years or something?</p>
<p>No, not even.</p>
<p>Not even.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it's just too soon.</p>
<p>I think- It's too soon.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't know.</p>
<p>Would you put a time on something for what is the minimum you have to be able to use this expression about it?</p>
<p>No, you're right.</p>
<p>You have to go back.</p>
<p>You have to go back 10 years, probably 10 years.</p>
<p>I think 10 also.</p>
<p>I think that's the soonest, right?</p>
<p>So-</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>soonest, right?</p>
<p>So I mean, all right, so let's talk about something that would stand the test of time.</p>
<p>Is there a TV show that when you think of it, you think this stands the test of time?</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, I don't know a lot of TV shows, Michelle.</p>
<p>Do you have one?</p>
<p>Do you have an example?</p>
<p>Oh, I think Seinfeld stands the test of time.</p>
<p>But we can talk about the inverse.</p>
<p>So we're going to talk about another expression, which I think fits more what we were touching on in the beginning.</p>
<p>So we'll talk about, we'll save that.</p>
<p>So I think Seinfeld stands the test of time.</p>
<p>As far as a movie, there's, I mean, yeah, I don't, well, our listeners can, this is, you know, also the thing is like we can say one movie does or does not.</p>
<p>This is an opinion thing.</p>
<p>This is an opinion thing.</p>
<p>Because Seinfeld, I think if you really dug into Seinfeld, you could find some off color jokes and some things that wouldn't fly now because we've just become a more politically correct culture.</p>
<p>Well, so yeah.</p>
<p>And I think.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>Well, so yeah, and I think that's that's an important point.</p>
<p>So this kind of goes back to that double meaning You know in one way, it means it's it's still popular.</p>
<p>It's still significant, right?</p>
<p>I mean and it and it certainly I think that part is true But then there's the other piece of is it would it like you sometimes you might hear somebody say?</p>
<p>Oh that wouldn't fly today.</p>
<p>I wouldn't fly that wouldn't be acceptable today would be the more formal way of say Yeah So are you saying that Seinfeld stands the test of time in the sense of it's still funny or that it's still like Politically correct is essentially I think it's still funny.</p>
<p>I think it's still funny.</p>
<p>And I think it's still popular I think it's still culturally significant.</p>
<p>Yes, Yes, Yeah, I think it always will be you know So this is a matter So you kind of do have to say more than just it doesn't stand the test of time you have to say here's why?</p>
<p>It's just not funny anymore.</p>
<p>It's just not relevant anymore I don't know.</p>
<p>Just things are changing so much with the internet with friends.</p>
<p>Do people hang out in coffee shops?</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>With friends, do people hang out in coffee shops as a group every day anymore?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I mean, that's funny.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I mean, that's interesting too.</p>
<p>I mean, seeing, well, I mean, whenever you see a, when, I don't know, do you ever see on a TV show where then they can't get in touch with us?</p>
<p>It's each other, it's before cell phones, and the whole episode is just not believable anymore.</p>
<p>Yeah, could have been easily fixed with a cell phone, right, one of the... Yeah, But that's kind of refreshing when I watch those, I think, wow, life was so different back then, you know, it's kind of refreshing, I don't know.</p>
<p>Right, right, like maybe two characters are looking for each other, and this one leaves a note here and there, and you think, well, this just wouldn't happen.</p>
<p>This entire story wouldn't exist.</p>
<p>It's true, it's true, it's so true.</p>
<p>So, but Lindsay, after the break, we're gonna talk about some other ways that you can talk about the similar idea that touches more on that second meaning where something isn't necessarily...</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>second meaning where something isn't necessarily politically correct anymore.</p>
<p>It doesn't quite work anymore.</p>
<p>So a little, a good expression.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Let's take a quick break and then we'll come right back.</p>
<p>Yes, Okay.</p>
<p>All right, Michelle, we are back.</p>
<p>So well, first of all, we do have a few other ways to express this, right?</p>
<p>Which so this is the one that I was talking about where it's meant more on the edge of it doesn't work anymore.</p>
<p>So this is something did, or usually we say something didn't age well.</p>
<p>Right, We usually don't say it aged well, right?</p>
<p>It's more common to say it didn't age well.</p>
<p>Yeah, More common in the negative sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Right, So this now, now we're really zeroing in on this as meaning of maybe something for politically incorrect reasons or world events or just something where you watch it and it gives you that, I'm going to say that cringey feeling like, Ooh, that doesn't.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>Like, ooh, that doesn't, yeah, that doesn't work anymore.</p>
<p>Or that's uncomfortable now, something they said, right?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, a hundred percent.</p>
<p>A hundred percent.</p>
<p>I mean, as I was saying, there's a scene in, not too many, but in Good Will Hunting, there's a scene where Robin Williams refers to indigenous people in kind of a very weird way.</p>
<p>And I cringe.</p>
<p>I was like, oh, gosh.</p>
<p>Um, not good.</p>
<p>And, yeah, and it's kind of heartbreaking when you go back and you sort of watch these movies and you think, wow, you know, that was okay at that time in the 90s, but it's not, it's just interesting.</p>
<p>But then you realize how much things have changed.</p>
<p>Right, Yeah, Well, I mean, there have even been, I can't remember what it was.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>I think it was a movie with Gwyneth Paltrow.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>And she's wearing, like, a, a suit over her body to make her look morbidly obese.</p>
<p>And I think there's, there, there, then the actor sometimes, you're, you're,</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>Then the actor sometimes your years later come out and they talk about They talk about oh, this wasn't right or yeah, I wouldn't have made this today Because you realize it just it it feels very uncomfortable And you don't even realize how much things are changing until you watch one of these I mean for me, I felt like the show I my one of my favorite musicals is Avenue Q. Yeah Mm-hmm and When I had seen it, you know It had been years and years since I had seen it and then I took down a few years ago He had never seen it and I'm watching it and I said it's something it doesn't feel as comfortable anymore and Interesting.</p>
<p>So it gives you that a little bit of a you know He wasn't laughing that much and I thought oh, but it did he not like did he not like Avenue Q or I think he Thought it was fine.</p>
<p>But I just I just wasn't I think there had been two We had become too politically charged and some of the things that are now</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>and some of the things that are now politically incorrect that were in the show.</p>
<p>And it kind of makes you think, oh, I laughed at this.</p>
<p>But some of it is touching on just that idea.</p>
<p>Well, whatever it is, it just gave me a little, it wasn't quite as comfortable as another musical, I'll say that.</p>
<p>Yeah, so this is really, when we're having these thoughts, these are kind of thoughts that go on in our own heads.</p>
<p>Is this okay now?</p>
<p>It's a reflection, it's an opportunity to think about how society's changed.</p>
<p>So it's a good conversation starter for our listeners.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yeah, what else, Michelle?</p>
<p>What else do we need to know here to talk about this?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, so again, I think that something didn't age well.</p>
<p>I think that's mostly about entertainment rather than fashion or style.</p>
<p>But the word timeless, this one is very versatile.</p>
<p>I think this one could be used for fashion, TV.</p>
<p>It's very versatile.</p>
<p>But you want to say something.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>But you wouldn't say something isn't timeless, would you Lindsay?</p>
<p>You would just say something is just it's kind of similar to priceless It's taken out of the vacuum of time.</p>
<p>It's taken out of the I don't know the Restrictions of time and something that's priceless is held above price, right?</p>
<p>And it's it works all the time timeless works all the time, you know, it's like a treasure, you know, right, right, right Exactly.</p>
<p>So this is more like something as classic which is another good word Yeah, you can say the show.</p>
<p>I love Lucy is timeless Hardwood floors are timeless when you choose your I did I do want to say something about this, you know It was work because we're trying to renovate our bathrooms.</p>
<p>We've tried to make choices that are somewhat timeless Yeah, and also somewhat plain I don't want to say plain but neutral just be a lot of whites and blacks and Browns because if we rent our house in The future I don't want someone coming in and saying oh my god a purple wall.</p>
<p>I don't like yeah I'm not gonna rent this house.</p>
<p>Of course, that's you know, so that's that's</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>So that's another example.</p>
<p>When you choose your decor of your home, sometimes you might want to go for timeless, right?</p>
<p>Right, It's interesting.</p>
<p>It's always that debate.</p>
<p>Sometimes they say, oh, but just go for what you like.</p>
<p>Everything is going to change no matter what.</p>
<p>Yeah, you could go for timeless, but go for what you like.</p>
<p>So it's always a little bit of that debate.</p>
<p>It's a debate.</p>
<p>What is it worth?</p>
<p>Yeah, Sorry.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>Should you make this maybe a little bit more of a risky decision, but you know that you're going to look back on it?</p>
<p>Dan always says that he thinks that you should try different, funny outfits.</p>
<p>Just go with the trends.</p>
<p>He says it's a good thing if you look back at what you were wearing and say, oh, and it just means that you were going along with what you liked at the time.</p>
<p>No, I agree.</p>
<p>Because if you look at old home videos, if you watch old home videos, there's no escaping it.</p>
<p>You're wearing something like right now people are starting to wear the</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p>Like, right now, people are starting to wear the wide-leg pants, and we used to wear skinny jeans.</p>
<p>I'm still wearing skinny.</p>
<p>But, like, if you look at home videos from the 90s, you're going to be wearing a slap bracelet or some neon or something ridiculous, and you're going to love that as part of your past.</p>
<p>It's your family.</p>
<p>It's your friends.</p>
<p>There's beauty there, right?</p>
<p>Right, Yeah, Instead of just maybe looking kind of vanilla, if you're wearing, you know, something fun.</p>
<p>I mean, just yesterday.</p>
<p>And then everything comes back around, right?</p>
<p>Yesterday, my friend came over, and she was wearing the most adorable jacket I'd ever seen.</p>
<p>Yes, It was so cute.</p>
<p>And I was complimenting her.</p>
<p>I was going crazy for this jacket.</p>
<p>And she said, it was actually my grandma's. Yeah, She said she got it a couple years ago because it had gone out of style, but now it's back.</p>
<p>It's true.</p>
<p>If you can keep your stuff in your closet for 30 years, it will eventually come back.</p>
<p>I'm still waiting on the slap bracelets.</p>
<p>I'm not sure about that.</p>
<p>That's so funny.</p>
<p>Yeah, So timeless and classic.</p>
<p>These are, and this is the source of great connection too, right?</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p>is the source of great connection to, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, look at look at how we just got all excited to talk about.</p>
<p>I mean, it's just a fun.</p>
<p>It's just a fun topic.</p>
<p>I mean, Lindsay, which one of these are you mostly likely to use in your conversations?</p>
<p>I like timeless.</p>
<p>I think it's great.</p>
<p>This idea of like I said, I like the word treasure.</p>
<p>Something's kind of a treasure.</p>
<p>Still, it was a treasure then in the 1920s, and it's a treasure now.</p>
<p>And we we hold this thing in high regard, whether it's a movie or a style.</p>
<p>It's something classic and timeless.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, and this is just Yeah, just so good for connection to talk about, express your opinions, share your nostalgic feelings, give recommendations.</p>
<p>But I think let's skip and go to do a role play.</p>
<p>Yeah, let's do a role play.</p>
<p>So here, Michelle, we are flipping through TV shows, and we're deciding what to watch.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Oh, let's watch The Office.</p>
<p>Love that show.</p>
<p>It's a classic.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>It stands the test of time.</p>
<p>Yeah, some</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p>of time.</p>
<p>Yeah, some episodes didn't age well, but overall, it's great.</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>Yeah, everyone loves The Office.</p>
<p>I don't know it well enough to dissect whether it did stand the test of time or not, but it's a good one.</p>
<p>It's a good one, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I know that there was some controversy because there were some politically incorrect episodes that some channel, I can't remember which one, took it off the air because it was more politically incorrect.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>I didn't know that.</p>
<p>And there was a debate about it because, in fact, they said that, again, I don't remember exactly, so something like that the episode was actually aware that it was politically incorrect and they was using that as a teachable moment.</p>
<p>So it's interesting how there are a lot of debates that happen now, especially as we get a little bit more progressive as a society where it kind of goes into the idea of cancel culture and taking things off the air and do you...</p>
<h2>Part-21</h2>
<p>and taking things off the air.</p>
<p>And do you let thing, do you try and get rid of the things that are now offensive or do you just let them be?</p>
<p>So interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, it's true.</p>
<p>Really interesting.</p>
<p>And this could be another great conversation started for our listeners.</p>
<p>Let's go through the role play real quick.</p>
<p>So, because I want you guys to be able to use these words, okay?</p>
<p>So what you said first, I said, let's watch The Office.</p>
<p>And you said, oh, I love that show.</p>
<p>It's a classic, meaning it was popular in the eight, the nineties and it's popular now, right?</p>
<p>Right, it's become a classic.</p>
<p>You can kind of tell when something's become a classic, it's still popular, it's still well-known.</p>
<p>Yeah, Movies, TV shows, whatever.</p>
<p>So then I said, then you said, totally, it stands the test of time.</p>
<p>And you said, yeah, some episodes didn't age well.</p>
<p>And when we hear that, yeah, we know it's gonna be a bit of a disagreement, right?</p>
<p>That could be another episode for another day.</p>
<p>The way we say, yeah, could actually mean no.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<h2>Part-22</h2>
<p>So, yeah, some episodes didn't age well, but overall it's great, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, Yes, Yeah, Definitely.</p>
<p>And just another thing that's important to note, we do also use the term aged well to refer to people like that person's aged really well.</p>
<p>They look really good or they haven't aged well, but that's another episode for another day.</p>
<p>I think, Michelle.</p>
<p>Yeah, Do you think?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah, That's a good one.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I think that was 2317.</p>
<p>That was how to acknowledge wins in life.</p>
<p>So, Lindsey, what's the takeaway today?</p>
<p>This is, I feel like we could have talked about this for five episodes.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think actually we're going to ask a poll question and maybe it's going to be around your style.</p>
<p>You know, do you lean, think about how you come down on these things.</p>
<p>Do you lean more on the side of classic and timeless or do you lean more on the side of express yourself in the moment, even if it doesn't age well or even if it doesn't look great 10 years from now?</p>
<p>You're just living life.</p>
<h2>Part-23</h2>
<p>10 years from now, you're just living life fully, you're not thinking about how something is going to look in 10 years.</p>
<p>That would be an interesting question.</p>
<p>I think that would be our poll for today.</p>
<p>That is.</p>
<p>Yeah, Love it.</p>
<p>Yeah, The takeaway is participate in the poll.</p>
<p>Make your voice heard.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
