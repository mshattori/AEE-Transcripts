<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p id="p-6">Is to say that you are going to quickly visit someone or run an errand in English.</p>
<p id="p-7">Hello, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-8">How are you today? I'm feeling really good today.</p>
<p id="p-9">Feeling good today.</p>
<p id="p-10">The sun is shining in Denver.</p>
<p id="p-11">How about you, Aubrey? How's it going? I am great.</p>
<p id="p-12">I have a question.</p>
<p id="p-13">Um, anybody, you're going to run by and visit today, run by and visit.</p>
<p id="p-14">No, that's actually no visits today.</p>
<p id="p-15">Unfortunately.</p>
<p id="p-16">I wish though.</p>
<p id="p-17">I wish I had family members really close by that.</p>
<p id="p-18">I could just drop in on them but they live on the other side of the country.</p>
<p id="p-19">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-20">Right, I know.</p>
<p id="p-21">It's tricky.</p>
<p id="p-22">It's always nice to have somebody that you're in that pop in level.</p>
<p id="p-23">Right, I have a couple of neighbors now where we can just pop in at any time and it's not weird but it takes a while to build the relationship.</p>
<p id="p-24">It's usually just family.</p>
<p id="p-25">Yeah, for sure, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-26">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-27">So, what was the special verb you used to ask me that question? Just one more time at the top of the show.</p>
<p id="p-28">So run by, we're going to dive in</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-29">By, we're going to dive into this today.</p>
<p id="p-30">There are some phrasal verbs with run that we use to talk about visiting or going somewhere.</p>
<p id="p-31">This is so native and natural instead to say run, run to run by, run in.</p>
<p id="p-32">We use it a lot of different ways.</p>
<p id="p-33">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-34">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-35">This was inspired.</p>
<p id="p-36">Today's episode was inspired by a question in youtube guys.</p>
<p id="p-37">We're over on youtube, check us out over there.</p>
<p id="p-38">This is from Dana pack 4967.</p>
<p id="p-39">Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-40">Could you read Dana's question? Yes, I said I love your podcasts.</p>
<p id="p-41">They are so English.</p>
<p id="p-42">Could you please tell me what natives say instead of visit? Like I visit my grandparents on Sundays.</p>
<p id="p-43">I love this question because I can tell this listener knows that this feels sort of formal and stiff to say like I'm going to visit and they've likely heard a lot of other ways, but like sometimes you don't have a notebook there to keep note of it.</p>
<p id="p-44">So it's like, oh, I got to find out what's a better way to say this.</p>
<p id="p-45">Yeah, I mean, we just, you know, this is what we're doing on all English, we're trying to become more.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-46">We're doing on all English, we're trying to become more human and less robotic in English, right? We learned of the robotic English in school and our textbooks, the one verb that feels too formal.</p>
<p id="p-47">Now we're trying to become human and connect.</p>
<p id="p-48">So let's see how we do it in this context.</p>
<p id="p-49">Yes, And we did this has been a little while ago, but we did an amazing episode about this.</p>
<p id="p-50">It was you and Michelle 1621.</p>
<p id="p-51">So you'd have to come back to our blog search for 1621.</p>
<p id="p-52">It was called Visit Stop By and Swing By.</p>
<p id="p-53">What's the difference in English? So this was a pretty full and complete answer to that question.</p>
<p id="p-54">There are so many better, more native ways to say visit you guys talked about pop by pop over, stop by, stop at, stop over, swing by.</p>
<p id="p-55">There are so many great ways to say this and there's still more right? We're going to show today.</p>
<p id="p-56">I mean, I love that we didn't even get close to finishing.</p>
<p id="p-57">There's so many, I know these are the ones that weren't covered in that episode.</p>
<p id="p-58">So go check that out for all of them?</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-59">So go check that out for all of those meanings.</p>
<p id="p-60">And then we didn't talk about the ones with run, right? I often say run by, run over, run in, run two.</p>
<p id="p-61">So we're going to share how you can use these also to talk about visiting or going somewhere.</p>
<p id="p-62">And I wonder why run is a key verb here.</p>
<p id="p-63">Something tells me it's about not wanting to impose too much, you know.</p>
<p id="p-64">Yes, Right, If you're just, oh, I was just running, I'm just gonna run by.</p>
<p id="p-65">It's interesting how it implies not a big deal.</p>
<p id="p-66">If you're not there, we don't have to have it scheduled.</p>
<p id="p-67">It's just so no pressure.</p>
<p id="p-68">No.</p>
<p id="p-69">And it also implies I could also run out quickly if you know, whatever is not a good time.</p>
<p id="p-70">So there's something about that verb that does imply some kind of meaning.</p>
<p id="p-71">I'm trying not to impose, but I'd like to see you.</p>
<p id="p-72">Right, Whereas a visit really feels like, oh, we need to have this scheduled, we need to have a plan to visit.</p>
<p id="p-73">This is I'm going to be there for quite a while.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-74">I'm going to be there for quite a while.</p>
<p id="p-75">It's amazing how much that sort of implies that it's more formal.</p>
<p id="p-76">Yeah, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-77">This is really colloquial, really neighborhood ish, right? What we're learning today? Um I love it.</p>
<p id="p-78">This is how we get to know people in our communities.</p>
<p id="p-79">Yes, So let's dive in with the first one which is run two and this can mean visit or it could also mean go.</p>
<p id="p-80">So we'll share examples how we use it both ways.</p>
<p id="p-81">Oh, this is really common.</p>
<p id="p-82">So for example, I'm going to run to my grandma's house but it's not just family Aubrey, right? With this one, this could just be, you're going to the store, for example.</p>
<p id="p-83">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-84">So he said he's running to the store.</p>
<p id="p-85">I'm going to run to the store.</p>
<p id="p-86">So that's where this one's a little tricky because when you talk about your grandma, you do mean visit, I'm going to run to my grandma's.</p>
<p id="p-87">It might be a quick visit, but maybe not.</p>
<p id="p-88">I could run to my grandma's and stay for four hours, right? It really just means you're going to go, you're going to visit.</p>
<p id="p-89">But such a more like you said, it's flexible.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-90">More like you said, it's flexible, it's flexible here.</p>
<p id="p-91">You have no idea how long I'm going to say when I say I'm going to run to her.</p>
<p id="p-92">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-93">And I could see how this could be interpreted literally if you know, we're at the intermediate levels of English, we don't literally mean that we're physically going to run to the library.</p>
<p id="p-94">Just be careful there.</p>
<p id="p-95">Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-96">Right, I ran to the library earlier.</p>
<p id="p-97">I didn't really run.</p>
<p id="p-98">Someone might have, they might have actually been running, but likely not, this likely means they were driving and they just stopped by.</p>
<p id="p-99">Yes, totally.</p>
<p id="p-100">Or I ran to the library earlier.</p>
<p id="p-101">Um Yeah, very common.</p>
<p id="p-102">Super common.</p>
<p id="p-103">Should we move on to the second one? Abre Sure.</p>
<p id="p-104">I wanted to ask you quickly, Lindsay in my regional dialect growing up, we would often say run C let's run C grammar.</p>
<p id="p-105">I'm going to run C grandma.</p>
<p id="p-106">Was that common where you lived as well? No, that sounds kind of funny.</p>
<p id="p-107">I googled and I was trying to find, I couldn't find it much.</p>
<p id="p-108">So I was like, I'm going to ask Lindsay, you might hear this depending on where you are?</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-109">This depending on where you are, especially in the States.</p>
<p id="p-110">But a little more rare, let's run a little more rare.</p>
<p id="p-111">That sounds like it.</p>
<p id="p-112">I used to be at one point someone intended to say run and see, I'm going to run in and then it eventually blended with the end became the and right.</p>
<p id="p-113">We don't have time to say the and, and see, but I wouldn't say it.</p>
<p id="p-114">I would say I'm going to run and see this person.</p>
<p id="p-115">I would say that for sure, but run.</p>
<p id="p-116">See.</p>
<p id="p-117">No, not in, not in my vocabulary.</p>
<p id="p-118">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-119">The second one here is run by and this is a little different implies that you are already out or that you'll be out when you go.</p>
<p id="p-120">Right, So you wouldn't, if you're home, you wouldn't be like I'm going to run by.</p>
<p id="p-121">Grandma's.</p>
<p id="p-122">No, you would say I'm going to run too.</p>
<p id="p-123">I'm going to stop by.</p>
<p id="p-124">There are a lot of other ways you would say it, meaning I'm going to go, I'm going to visit, run by.</p>
<p id="p-125">It's like I'm already out and I'm going to go somewhere, I'm going to run by somewhere.</p>
<p id="p-126">You could, but you could say it if you're at home, if you're.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-127">But you could say it if you're at home, if you're describing what you're going to do today, I'm going to run to the store and then I'm going to run by grandma's house and then I'm going to come home and that would be because you're sort of imagining yourself already out when you do it.</p>
<p id="p-128">Right, You're saying like, when I'm out, then I'll run by.</p>
<p id="p-129">Right, Yes, Yes, Real technicalities here, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-130">Totally interesting.</p>
<p id="p-131">All the little nuances.</p>
<p id="p-132">So you might say I'm going to run by my grandma's tonight and it is, you're sort of putting yourself in the mental state of knowing I'm already at volleyball practice or something and then I'm going to run by grandma's on my way home.</p>
<p id="p-133">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-134">Or I'm planning to run by Target on the way home.</p>
<p id="p-135">Do you want me to pick anything up for you? That might be the context of what you're saying.</p>
<p id="p-136">It's not just visiting a person.</p>
<p id="p-137">This can also be used just to mean, go and this doesn't play a quick visit.</p>
<p id="p-138">Right, It's rare.</p>
<p id="p-139">I think you'd be like, I'm going to run by grandma's planning to stay there for several hours.</p>
<p id="p-140">Sure.</p>
<p id="p-141">Yes, Or I ran by the store on the way home.</p>
<p id="p-142">Right, And picked up some milk in it.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-143">Right, and picked up some milk and eggs, typical stuff.</p>
<p id="p-144">Very typical.</p>
<p id="p-145">This phrasal verb is extremely common.</p>
<p id="p-146">We use it all the time to mean, I'm going to go there quickly.</p>
<p id="p-147">I'm going to stop by, run by.</p>
<p id="p-148">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-149">All right, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-150">So the last one is run in.</p>
<p id="p-151">Now, tell us about this one.</p>
<p id="p-152">This one's a little different.</p>
<p id="p-153">Right? It sort of means you're already somewhere and then you're going to actually go in either to visit or for whatever reason.</p>
<p id="p-154">Right, So maybe we have both driven somewhere and I say I'm gonna run in, want to come.</p>
<p id="p-155">So we're already there.</p>
<p id="p-156">Just another way of saying I'm going to go in, I'm gonna go in essentially, it's just a more casual.</p>
<p id="p-157">Maybe you're implying again, you're going to go in quickly by run by using that run instead of go.</p>
<p id="p-158">I'm going to run in and I'm assuming you're going to come back out quickly.</p>
<p id="p-159">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-160">Right, This way, if you're going to go and visit someone for a couple of hours, you wouldn't say run in, you'd either say I'm going to go in or I'm going to drop by, stop by all these others that don't imply time, this implies you will be quick.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-161">Time this implies you will be quick.</p>
<p id="p-162">Yes, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-163">And today's episode, you know, a lot of these uh phrase phrasal verbs, they're really kind of phrasal verbs, aren't they? You say so? Yeah, they're s verbs will probably be highlighted in our real time transcripts in the app.</p>
<p id="p-164">I mean, what a cool way to learn guys.</p>
<p id="p-165">We want to recommend that you get the app, go to Allers English dot com slash app.</p>
<p id="p-166">We have added some new speed variations.</p>
<p id="p-167">You can choose to listen on 1.1 X 0.9 X.</p>
<p id="p-168">We don't think you can do this on any other podcast player.</p>
<p id="p-169">Currently, this is so helpful because often for me, 1.5 or two will be just a little too fast or a little too slow.</p>
<p id="p-170">So it's so nice to be able to make that more specific to the speed.</p>
<p id="p-171">You want to hear it at 1.75.</p>
<p id="p-172">There's a lot, we've built a lot of new customization in there.</p>
<p id="p-173">So guys check out the app at Allers English dot com slash app and we're going to hear these phrasal verbs now in a roleplay and speaking of role plays.</p>
<p id="p-174">I'm most excited about this addition to the app.</p>
<p id="p-175">Really.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-176">To the app really in the bonus premium feed.</p>
<p id="p-177">We are doing role plays that recap the vocab from the entire week.</p>
<p id="p-178">I think that's so useful to be able to see all this vocabulary that you're learning trying to add to your active vocabulary to hear it all in a roleplay.</p>
<p id="p-179">Yeah, we can call these the roleplay recaps only in the app right now.</p>
<p id="p-180">They're not available anywhere else.</p>
<p id="p-181">So go over there to review all of the keywords that you learned that any given week.</p>
<p id="p-182">All right.</p>
<p id="p-183">All right.</p>
<p id="p-184">Let's dive in here.</p>
<p id="p-185">You and I are sisters in this role play Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-186">All right.</p>
<p id="p-187">Sounds good.</p>
<p id="p-188">So let's go.</p>
<p id="p-189">All right.</p>
<p id="p-190">I'm going to run to grandma's.</p>
<p id="p-191">I have a birthday present for her.</p>
<p id="p-192">I'll come, I'll come with you.</p>
<p id="p-193">Can we run by the grocery store on the way home? For sure.</p>
<p id="p-194">I'll wait in the car while you run in.</p>
<p id="p-195">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-196">Sounds very typical.</p>
<p id="p-197">Very, very natural and native and you absolutely would use all of these in the same conversation like this because they have different meanings.</p>
<p id="p-198">That doesn't feel weird at all.</p>
<p id="p-199">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-200">So first thing you said I'm going to run</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-201">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-202">So first thing you said, I'm going to run to grandma's house.</p>
<p id="p-203">And what you really would say, the way that would sound for me is I'm going to run, I'm going to run.</p>
<p id="p-204">Right, That's another episode for another day.</p>
<p id="p-205">But I'm not saying I'm going to run.</p>
<p id="p-206">We're running it all together.</p>
<p id="p-207">I think we could do a cool episode on that in the future, Abria around that phrase, I'm going to, I'm going, I'm going to run the pronunciation there.</p>
<p id="p-208">I'm gonna interesting.</p>
<p id="p-209">And then this is, there is no time here, right? I'm going to run to grandma's.</p>
<p id="p-210">I could stay for a while.</p>
<p id="p-211">It could be a quick visit.</p>
<p id="p-212">You don't know.</p>
<p id="p-213">Right, And then what did I say? And you asked you're saying I'll come with you can we run by the grocery store? And this does imply very quick, right? I just need to grab something quickly on the way for sure.</p>
<p id="p-214">Good.</p>
<p id="p-215">And then you said for sure, I'll wait in the car while you run in.</p>
<p id="p-216">So the assumption there is that again, you're gonna be quick in the grocery store, right? Because you've said run by, I know you're going to be quick and I'm like, yeah, no problem.</p>
<p id="p-217">I'll wait in the car and this might be me.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-218">No problem.</p>
<p id="p-219">I'll wait in the car and this might be me confirming.</p>
<p id="p-220">I'm like, yeah, if it's quick, I'll wait in the car while you run in and that's your chance to be like, I'm gonna be a while.</p>
<p id="p-221">Make sure you run in and we're not.</p>
<p id="p-222">When I said I'm going to run by the grocery store.</p>
<p id="p-223">I meant that I need to go for a while.</p>
<p id="p-224">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-225">There is an implication here.</p>
<p id="p-226">Right? If I'm going to wait for you, we're not doing a full weekly shopping trip trip.</p>
<p id="p-227">You're grabbing something like milk or eggs, something you forgot, right.</p>
<p id="p-228">We're going to be on our way to grandma's so don't be getting anything refrigerated.</p>
<p id="p-229">We don't want to deal with that right now.</p>
<p id="p-230">Make it quick, make it quick.</p>
<p id="p-231">Um Any takeaway for our listeners.</p>
<p id="p-232">Where should we leave our listeners today? What do they think about? There are so many ways to say, visit in English.</p>
<p id="p-233">I love this listener's question because you don't want to have to say, visit all over.</p>
<p id="p-234">Like you said, Lindsay, you learned this in a textbook.</p>
<p id="p-235">This is the one verb you're given.</p>
<p id="p-236">There are so many better ways to say, visit so many better ways.</p>
<p id="p-237">And the key is make sure you're visiting people right.</p>
<p id="p-238">There should be people that you're dropping in on running.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-239">That you're dropping in on running by, you know, running by their homes and, and you know, building those connections.</p>
<p id="p-240">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-241">Yes, Right, Make those connections so that you can run by somebody later today.</p>
<p id="p-242">I'll work on that.</p>
<p id="p-243">All right.</p>
<p id="p-244">A you have a good day.</p>
<p id="p-245">You too.</p>
<p id="p-246">Bye.</p>
<p id="p-247">Talk to you soon.</p>
