<p id="p-9">Hey, Lindsay, how are you? Hey, Michelle, I'm feeling great.</p>
<p id="p-10">How are you? What's going on? Yeah, I'm good.</p>
<p id="p-11">Um Do you think maybe we could finish 20 minutes early today? Oh, that's gonna be tough, Michelle, we've got a lot of episodes to get done.</p>
<p id="p-12">Here for all of you.</p>
<p id="p-13">That's true.</p>
<p id="p-14">All right.</p>
<p id="p-15">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-16">It's fine.</p>
<p id="p-17">I'll figure it out.</p>
<p id="p-18">I'll figure it out.</p>
<p id="p-19">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-20">That's good.</p>
<p id="p-21">I don't really.</p>
<p id="p-22">No, no, no, no, no, I'm good.</p>
<p id="p-23">I'm good.</p>
<p id="p-24">So, I wonder if our listeners picked up though on the nuance of today's episode just in our little conversation there.</p>
<p id="p-25">What do you think? Yes, I think, I think they did.</p>
<p id="p-26">I think they did so well.</p>
<p id="p-27">Today we're actually going to answer a listener question about the words perhaps.</p>
<p id="p-28">And maybe so this is going to be a fun one.</p>
<p id="p-29">I'm excited.</p>
<p id="p-30">So you said, do you think maybe we could finish 20 minutes early today? So I feel like maybe that's kind of new seeing that there in the middle of a thought, the word, maybe, maybe, maybe it is, maybe it is.</p>
<p id="p-31">Maybe guys before we get into the episode, we want to remind you if you haven't already go on over and get our app.</p>
<p id="p-32">It's an I Os and Android.</p>

<p id="p-34">You can follow along with the transcript written by a human.</p>
<p id="p-35">It's all good stuff.</p>
<p id="p-36">So we're looking to get that app, Lindsay guys, go get that app at all ears English dot com slash app.</p>
<p id="p-37">And again, it's available for I Os and Android.</p>
<p id="p-38">All right, good stuff.</p>
<p id="p-39">So Michelle today's episode is inspired by a listener, right? Um Alaa Rajesh, can I read Alaya Rajesh's question here? We go.</p>
<p id="p-40">All right.</p>
<p id="p-41">Hi, both.</p>
<p id="p-42">I'm a big fan of your podcast.</p>
<p id="p-43">Could you tell me the difference between perhaps and maybe this has been confusing me for a while.</p>
<p id="p-44">It's funny.</p>
<p id="p-45">I just realized that that's probably, it's pretty common for us to read the question and then we go, hm, we're like scientists, you know, thinking over the answer.</p>
<p id="p-46">Let's see this.</p>
<p id="p-47">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-48">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-49">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-50">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-51">Well, first, before we get into it, we are definitely going to answer this question for our listeners.</p>
<p id="p-52">But first we want to remind you guys to go over and check out episode 22 01.</p>
<p id="p-53">It just grew on me how to share when your tastes have changed in English.</p>
<p id="p-54">Also a very important episode to explain yourself how you have evolved as a person for.</p>
<p id="p-55">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-56">Wow.</p>
<p id="p-57">These episodes just fly by.</p>
<p id="p-58">I mean, I remember recording that episode.</p>
<p id="p-59">It seems like two seconds ago and it's already wow.</p>
<p id="p-60">So time flies, right? Hundreds of episodes later.</p>
<p id="p-61">Yes, Right, Yep.</p>
<p id="p-62">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-63">All right.</p>
<p id="p-64">Let's get started on these adverbs.</p>
<p id="p-65">So technically both can be used at the beginning of a sentence, but perhaps is OK, In my research for this episode, I saw that a lot of people were saying that perhaps is best or more correct if you want to use this in the middle.</p>
<p id="p-66">But I don't think this is followed in real life.</p>
<p id="p-67">So Lindsay, let's see, let's do an example of this.</p>
<p id="p-68">Um If I say to you, I'll perhaps buy a car next week.</p>
<p id="p-69">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-70">So that's prob, that's technically ok, according to some of my sources and I'll maybe buy a car next week, which is not, which is apparently not.</p>
<p id="p-71">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-72">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-73">But I disagree with your sources.</p>
<p id="p-74">I'm not sure who your sources are, but I disagree conversationally.</p>
<p id="p-75">Well, first, let's take a step back.</p>
<p id="p-76">What do these words mean? Perhaps and maybe let's do that.</p>
<p id="p-77">I just realized as I started, I realized, wait a second, we just got started the way down the road.</p>
<p id="p-78">I, I know.</p>
<p id="p-79">Um, ok, so it's, there's a possibility, there's a chance.</p>
<p id="p-80">We're not sure it could go one way other.</p>
<p id="p-81">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-82">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-83">And usually are these used at the beginning of a sentence, Michelle? I mean, we're talking about kind of a bit of an exception, putting them in the middle of a sentence, but generally, where do we find them? Most of the time? I would say most of the time they're at the beginning of a sentence.</p>
<p id="p-84">What do you think? Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p id="p-85">Like, maybe I'll buy a car next week.</p>
<p id="p-86">Right, Maybe I'll buy a car next week.</p>
<p id="p-87">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-88">So, thank you Lindsay for pulling us back.</p>
<p id="p-89">I don't know why I put that right at the beginning of the.</p>
<p id="p-90">No worries.</p>
<p id="p-91">No worries.</p>
<p id="p-92">We'd like to bring the new stuff to our listeners.</p>
<p id="p-93">I think most of our listeners probably know what these mean and know that usually sentences will start with these words.</p>
<p id="p-94">But we're showing you guys something new and different here.</p>
<p id="p-95">So I think maybe you're not aware of this.</p>
<p id="p-96">So tell us, tell us, you know, what belongs in the, which of these can go in the middle of a sentence.</p>
<p id="p-97">Well, so apparently perhaps is the better choice for this.</p>
<p id="p-98">But I really think that maybe is used quite frequently.</p>
<p id="p-99">Oh, I maybe, do you think maybe we could finish 20 minutes early today? Um, I'm maybe going to the gym.</p>
<p id="p-100">So the best place is at the beginning, but very conversationally, we're showing you something new that is a little break the rules.</p>
<p id="p-101">I'm breaking the rules all the time because I have a lot in the middle of a sentence because really what maybe is doing is it's showing that you're kind of thinking as you're talking in a way.</p>
<p id="p-102">Right, Right, Right, Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-103">Um, so, but let's focus on just in general, what is the difference between perhaps and maybe they basically mean the same thing.</p>
<p id="p-104">So how do we find the difference? I mean, definitely, maybe it is more common, it's less formal, it expresses being uncertain, something being possible.</p>
<p id="p-105">But, and it also might be more, I don't know because I feel like I hear British people saying perhaps more often that could be, I'm not sure we got to check that out.</p>
<p id="p-106">But in American English, I think, I think American English tends to be a little more casual maybe.</p>
<p id="p-107">Or, I don't know, it's hard to say I can't really understand but, you know what I'm saying? Right, Um, so I hear perhaps a lot less because what is it to you? It's less common.</p>
<p id="p-108">It's, to me it sounds pretty formal.</p>
<p id="p-109">Um, more something you might write in an essay or maybe in an email but it means the same, it has the same idea, it's expressing, being uncertain or something being possible.</p>
<p id="p-110">Um, going either way we don't know.</p>
<p id="p-111">So you can use perhaps.</p>
<p id="p-112">But if I heard someone just a friend casual when I'm at the playground for three hours every day, if I heard some really, almost three hours.</p>
<p id="p-113">Yeah, if I, it's something else.</p>
<p id="p-114">Um, but I, if I heard one of my friends saying, perhaps it might kind of make me turn my head.</p>
<p id="p-115">What do you think? Well, I think maybe this does depend on a lot of things like regional dialect where you're from again, the country you're from, I think maybe in England, for example, they might use perhaps more casually.</p>
<p id="p-116">Right, So it might be as casual as maybe I'm not sure.</p>
<p id="p-117">I'm not sure.</p>
<p id="p-118">But, yeah, I agree in, in my world, in, you know, been us, world, whatever that is us, it's more formal.</p>
<p id="p-119">I would tend to say it more in writing, but I would say it more at the start of a sentence.</p>
<p id="p-120">Perhaps they'll go out this weekend.</p>
<p id="p-121">Right, Right, And I think that maybe just, I mean, how many times do you, I think people say maybe a day probably 100 times.</p>
<p id="p-122">It's just so common.</p>
<p id="p-123">Um Each of these words can have a positive or a negative or a neutral sound.</p>
<p id="p-124">So we're going to give some more examples that it kind of depends on the tone of voice.</p>
<p id="p-125">So let's get into this.</p>
<p id="p-126">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-127">So, all right.</p>
<p id="p-128">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-129">Ok, Lindsay, do you want to record an extra episode today? Maybe.</p>
<p id="p-130">Not quite sure what we mean there being, then I said Michelle, hey, do you want to get sushi for lunch perhaps? So it depends how you say it or I could say it in a different way.</p>
<p id="p-131">I could say, oh, perhaps like um, so if you, you can change even though the same word, uh depending on how you say it could show a lot of what you're thinking.</p>
<p id="p-132">Uh They, I think with parents they say a lot, oh, if the kid says, oh, can we get ice cream after school? Oh, maybe or we'll see.</p>
<p id="p-133">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-134">I said before in another episode, I used to hear that all the time.</p>
<p id="p-135">We'll see.</p>
<p id="p-136">We'll see as a kid.</p>
<p id="p-137">I hated that.</p>
<p id="p-138">I hated that.</p>
<p id="p-139">Oh my God, we'll see because, you know, we'll see means no, usually, no.</p>
<p id="p-140">Right, Usually.</p>
<p id="p-141">No, usually no.</p>
<p id="p-142">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-143">It's a and I, and I think kids pick up on that for sure.</p>
<p id="p-144">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-145">Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-146">So what else? Where do we go from here? Ok.</p>
<p id="p-147">So maybe is also good for suggestions.</p>
<p id="p-148">So it can be like a one word answer kind of in the way we were just using it.</p>
<p id="p-149">Oh, maybe, maybe, but you can also use it for giving a suggestion.</p>
<p id="p-150">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-151">So for example, Lindsay, where should we go for dinner? Well, maybe we should try that new Italian place.</p>
<p id="p-152">Oh, yes.</p>
<p id="p-153">Yeah, this is how I use it a lot.</p>
<p id="p-154">Maybe we should do this.</p>
<p id="p-155">Maybe we should try this, right? Just throwing out ideas is all you're doing here, right? You're not saying we have to do this.</p>
<p id="p-156">Just giving an idea.</p>
<p id="p-157">Here's another example, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-158">Do you think we need to practice the speech anymore? Hm.</p>
<p id="p-159">Perhaps we should try it one more time? Ok.</p>
<p id="p-160">Nice, nice.</p>
<p id="p-161">Yes, And then we can mix it up and this is how natural English feels, right? So, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-162">I left my car unlocked.</p>
<p id="p-163">Oh, no.</p>
<p id="p-164">Do you think you should run back now? Maybe, maybe it's a good idea.</p>
<p id="p-165">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-166">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-167">So you're basically saying maybe as in, yes, I think I should, I probably should probably is another one we didn't talk about as much today.</p>
<p id="p-168">But yeah, means the same thing.</p>
<p id="p-169">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-170">But I'm saying may, it's almost when you say, do you think you should run back now? And I'm saying, maybe it's, you can imagine that we're at lunch a couple of blocks.</p>
<p id="p-171">Down the street.</p>
<p id="p-172">Do you ever have to do that if you're out at lunch and you have to either, you know, put money in the meter and it's so annoying.</p>
<p id="p-173">Yeah, that's too annoying.</p>
<p id="p-174">I know.</p>
<p id="p-175">You worry about getting a ticket and all these things or having your car get broken into and then I said, maybe it's a good idea, which means it might be a good idea.</p>
<p id="p-176">So, I'm encouraging you to go and fix that.</p>
<p id="p-177">Right, Because it sounds like I'm too lazy to get up.</p>
<p id="p-178">I don't want to leave my chicken salad sandwich on the table.</p>
<p id="p-179">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-180">Yummy.</p>
<p id="p-181">I love chicken salad by the way.</p>
<p id="p-182">Too.</p>
<p id="p-183">Little grapes and walnuts.</p>
<p id="p-184">Yum.</p>
<p id="p-185">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-186">We're on the same page here.</p>
<p id="p-187">Yes, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-188">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-189">All right.</p>
<p id="p-190">So, and then here's a way that it could work in the workplace.</p>
<p id="p-191">Maybe.</p>
<p id="p-192">Maybe.</p>
<p id="p-193">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-194">Should we review the numbers for today perhaps? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-195">Perhaps we need to sit down for a good 20 minutes to go over them.</p>
<p id="p-196">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-197">And again.</p>
<p id="p-198">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-199">Sounds good.</p>
<p id="p-200">Sorry, I forgot.</p>
<p id="p-201">Oh, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-202">And so I want to make it clear.</p>
<p id="p-203">It's, we're not saying that at work you use perhaps and at home you use maybe.</p>
<p id="p-204">Right? Not making that distinction at all.</p>
<p id="p-205">This is not like business informal.</p>
<p id="p-206">Um, it's just that we want you to be able to use both.</p>
<p id="p-207">You should be mixing it up.</p>
<p id="p-208">Right, Mix it up guys.</p>
<p id="p-209">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-210">Perhaps is not the workplace.</p>
<p id="p-211">One you have to use, maybe I feel is still used most frequently at work.</p>
<p id="p-212">Uh, I, I, I don't, I just in general, I don't hear perhaps all that.</p>
<p id="p-213">No, it, for me personally, I don't really feel like it fits my personality that much to say.</p>
<p id="p-214">It, it feels a little like I said, a little formal, a little stiff, a little distanced from the person you're talking to.</p>
<p id="p-215">So I tend to use maybe.</p>
<p id="p-216">Are you the same way? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-217">It could also feel a little forced if you're almost like you're trying to be.</p>
<p id="p-218">So you're trying hard to be formal, right? You're it, it's just trying to give that personable feel to it, but it can be used.</p>
<p id="p-219">It's not to say it can't be used, but it's just not as common.</p>
<p id="p-220">Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-221">And then I feel like there's kind of the code word of what maybe means in the dating world especially uh you know what I'm talking about here, right? So often I think, I think, I mean, maybe this is for both genders, who knows? Um But generally if someone says, hey, we should go out again some time, maybe if someone says maybe that's usually a no, unfortunately.</p>
<p id="p-222">Yeah, that's the code for.</p>
<p id="p-223">No, no, they're not interested and maybe let them reach back out to you.</p>
<p id="p-224">So if you put feelers out after a first date or something, if you get a, maybe, you know, you might be thinking about moving on or something along those lines.</p>
<p id="p-225">So there are code words here in English in the, in the dating scene, I think for sure.</p>
<p id="p-226">And I just want to highlight this really great word you use.</p>
<p id="p-227">That's going to be on our personalized vocab power list on the app.</p>
<p id="p-228">We were talking about the word feelers.</p>
<p id="p-229">You said putting out feelers.</p>
<p id="p-230">That's a really common good one.</p>
<p id="p-231">What does that mean? Yeah, I think of like, uh I don't know any insect that has uh antennae putting out feelers, you throw out something, you make a suggestion and see how they respond just to get a sense of your status.</p>
<p id="p-232">Where are you at in this romantic relationship, this business relationship.</p>
<p id="p-233">Uh What, what are they thinking that's putting out feelers? OK, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-234">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-235">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-236">Well, we've done a lot of role plays today, so we're not going to do one big one, but we did lots of mini mini role plays for today.</p>
<p id="p-237">Um So Lindsay, what's the general thing? We want our listeners to go away from this episode? I feel like the biggest thing I want to say here is use language that feels right for your personality.</p>
<p id="p-238">You know, don't just because you want to expand your vocabulary, don't necessarily force yourself to use the word.</p>
<p id="p-239">Perhaps if it just feels maybe too formal, it feels slightly off for you, you know, be yourself in English, find a way to do that.</p>
<p id="p-240">We know, that's what you guys want.</p>
<p id="p-241">That's how we build the best connections because then people really know us for who we are.</p>
<p id="p-242">So, don't force yourself to work to use words that don't feel like you, I would say right.</p>
<p id="p-243">If perhaps doesn't feel right, don't just, just pretty much forget it.</p>
<p id="p-244">It's good to know it.</p>
<p id="p-245">But there's, I don't think you're going to find yourself in a situation where you have to use that word unless it's renown for you that you have to say it.</p>
<p id="p-246">But there's always other options.</p>
<p id="p-247">We can do a follow up on the other options.</p>
<p id="p-248">But yeah, we should, we should actually.</p>
<p id="p-249">Yeah, I just really wanted to focus on these two today.</p>
<p id="p-250">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-251">The more I think about it, I think I rarely use it.</p>
<p id="p-252">It's true.</p>
<p id="p-253">It just doesn't fit for me personally.</p>
<p id="p-254">So we'll come back for another episode or other alternatives to maybe there are plenty of them, right? We can mix around our grammar, say different things.</p>
<p id="p-255">There's a lot we can do guys make sure you send your questions into Lindsay at all Ears English dot com.</p>
