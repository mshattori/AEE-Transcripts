<p>Hello, Michelle.</p>
<p>How's it going today?</p>
<p>How's everything?</p>
<p>Everything is good.</p>
<p>Getting over a little bit of a cold, if you can hear it.</p>
<p>But I'm okay.</p>
<p>I'm okay.</p>
<p>Lindsay, do you come from a tight-knit family?</p>
<p>I would say, kind of.</p>
<p>We're relatively tight-knit.</p>
<p>I don't think we're the tightest of the tight-knits.</p>
<p>Of the tightly knitted families.</p>
<p>But we're somewhat tight, I guess.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>It seems like you do, yes?</p>
<p>I would say so.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>I would say so.</p>
<p>I would say my family is pretty tight-knit.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't live right near them, so I think we would be even more tight-knit than, you know, we are.</p>
<p>Than you are.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I mean, I talk to them all the time.</p>
<p>Yeah, But yeah, I'd like to talk to my brother more.</p>
<p>He actually called me yesterday, but I couldn't talk.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Do you talk to your brother, like, once a month, once a week, once a day?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, not once a day.</p>
<p>I mean, we have, like, a family chat, so sometimes we'll send pictures or things like that, but probably on the phone maybe once a month, and then otherwise we'll text, like, once a week or something.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>That's cool.</p>
<p>That's cool.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, Well, I'm excited to talk today about this expression.</p>
<p>You asked me, do you come from a tight-knit family?</p>
<p>And I have a feeling that this episode, this vocabulary today is really going to resonate with our listeners around the world because I think a lot of cultures, families tend to be even tighter.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>is families tend to be even tighter.</p>
<p>Do you think so, Michelle, based on your travels and things?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>I think that here it seems that there's a lot of emphasis of getting out of the house.</p>
<p>Yes, Independence.</p>
<p>And, you know, a flyaway little bird.</p>
<p>It's so true.</p>
<p>And whereas, I mean, I know, and maybe it's more unusual here that somebody lives right next to their parents or, you know, but I've seen in my travels and even family members of mine who live in another country, like they all kind of live in the same neighborhood and it's totally normal and they spend, you know, every Sunday dinner together or even more often.</p>
<p>So I think here sometimes there can be a little bit almost of, I don't want to say looking down upon, but I do think sometimes there's some.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>upon, but I do think sometimes there's some judgment if, oh, you talk to your parents all the time.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Right, Yes, Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, our culture has this whole narrative of by the time you're 18, you should be independent, you should be out of the house.</p>
<p>I think a lot of that is because of college, the step of going to university, and most people go to a college not in their hometown, right?</p>
<p>They go across the country or 200 miles away.</p>
<p>So if we took the college experience out, I actually wonder what it would be like.</p>
<p>I mean, there's also the factor that our geography is so huge, right?</p>
<p>And people move for jobs.</p>
<p>So I don't know, but it is definitely different around the world.</p>
<p>That is for sure.</p>
<p>Right, Michelle?</p>
<p>Yes, Yeah, Absolutely.</p>
<p>So today we are going to talk about this expression, tighten it, and share similar ones.</p>
<p>And this is really important for describing your family, even groups of your friends.</p>
<p>So it's just very useful for sharing bits of yourself with others.</p>
<p>So we're going to talk about that today.</p>
<p>But before we get into that, oh, I love these days when we have results.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>Oh, I love these days when we have results from Spotify poll results And what we've learned is that Michael Jackson is world-famous, right?</p>
<p>So just to give some context again, we asked you which Halloween song is your favorite again?</p>
<p>And so thriller and somebody's watching me got the top two spots.</p>
<p>Well, no actually thriller got 41% Somebody's watching me got 10% What else Michelle?</p>
<p>Monster mash got 7% and this is Halloween That got 26%. Yeah I don't know if I even know that one.</p>
<p>That's really interesting And then Ghostbusters got 14.</p>
<p>But yeah, Michael Jackson came in with 50% of the share of you know Yeah, not not too surprising I don't think not too surprising So guys make sure you're participating in these polls that we do we do them for every episode But we announced the key ones Participate and make your voice heard.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, and just so you know</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, And just so you know, in case you didn't hear that episode, that was episode 2292.</p>
<p>You can't go wrong with these Halloween songs.</p>
<p>And that rhymes too.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So let's get back to the term tighten it.</p>
<p>Yeah, What does that mean?</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, It means to be close with someone, right.</p>
<p>It's human beings, whether it's a group or a family, you're close.</p>
<p>And I think everyone kind of defines that differently.</p>
<p>Right, So it's kind of a subjective question.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, I when I think of tight knit, I actually think of knitting like a scarf.</p>
<p>Oh, cool.</p>
<p>Right, I think of the loops and how, you know, if you're like that, I don't know.</p>
<p>I have this visual in my head for this word tight knit because I don't know if that's where it comes from.</p>
<p>But I think probably and knit guys.</p>
<p>Lindsay, how do we spell the knit part?</p>
<p>Well, the whole thing is a little bit.</p>
<p>It's a little bit of a tricky and tricky trickster trick here.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>here.</p>
<p>Okay, so how to spell this.</p>
<p>So I'm going to spell it out.</p>
<p>So tight is T-I-G-H-T, and then we have a dash in there, and it's knit.</p>
<p>K-N-I-T. There's a K in there, just like in the word no, to know.</p>
<p>Right, Right, Or knife.</p>
<p>Yeah, the silent K. Yup.</p>
<p>Yup.</p>
<p>Yup.</p>
<p>So basically, we use this to talk about our relationships, share information with others about our relationships, our backgrounds.</p>
<p>So it's often used, as I mentioned before, with words about maybe family or your community, a group of friends, anything else that comes to mind?</p>
<p>Yeah, I'd say generally the closer relationships, maybe like a sports team, but it's generally reserved for people that you could be very, very close to, like a family or a group of friends.</p>
<p>Sports team is maybe, is that, do you think that applies to, let's say you're all really close?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>You're all really close.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, I think yeah I mean, I think any sort of any sort of group of people that you spend time with so even your office mates Okay, you know you could say oh, I'm really tight-knit with my co-workers or yeah Yeah, so any any any group of people really?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that's right groups of people So let's do some examples here.</p>
<p>I'm gonna throw out the first one.</p>
<p>I come from a really tight-knit family So it was important for me to find a partner who thinks family is the number one priority so a lot of people when they come from a family that they're close to they also want a Partner that has the same values, right?</p>
<p>Right because if they're gonna be You know speaking to their family all the time or they're gonna want to do a lot of things with their family and their partner Doesn't really understand that or thinks that it's weird.</p>
<p>It might cause conflicts because they might yeah, that could be tricky Yeah, for sure, what's another example Michelle, okay, I live in a very tight-knit community it's</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>I live in a very tight-knit community.</p>
<p>It's great because people are always there to help each other out, like with babysitting.</p>
<p>It's the best.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Yeah, Community is another good example.</p>
<p>Maybe it's just your neighborhood, right?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Or your community center, even, where people... And that is kind of the idea of it takes a village, that expression, you know, to really... Uh-huh.</p>
<p>And I think that's... Actually, this is a bigger conversation we could have another day around the status of being a parent in the U.S. Did you hear that the Surgeon General made a warning against parenting?</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Yeah, What was it?</p>
<p>Yeah, I did hear that, but what was the warning?</p>
<p>Yeah, He said... You know, in the past, the Surgeon General's made warnings against smoking, obviously.</p>
<p>Right, Drinking, obviously.</p>
<p>And now it's parenting.</p>
<p>So they said, he or she said, it's become... So it's not about the kids.</p>
<p>It's become about the parents' health.</p>
<p>Yeah, And it's due to the fact that we don't raise our kids as a village, quote-unquote, that cliche.</p>
<p>Yeah, It takes a village.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>cliche.</p>
<p>It takes a village.</p>
<p>We are very independent in the way we raise kids.</p>
<p>So often, maybe you don't live next to your parents for them to come over and help or a sister, brother, aunt, uncle.</p>
<p>No, it's usually just the two parents raising these kids.</p>
<p>And that's why we're talking about this.</p>
<p>The cost of childcare in the US is sky high.</p>
<p>You know, Michelle.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I don't need to tell you.</p>
<p>I'm preaching to the choir here.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I mean, we I don't live next door.</p>
<p>I mean, the closest family we have is about an hour away.</p>
<p>So we don't have that situation where Oh, I need to run to the doctor.</p>
<p>Can we can you watch the kids?</p>
<p>Or, you know, we've we've had a couple situations recently where you know, things have come up where it would just be so nice to just say, Oh, can you watch the kids for 20 minutes or an hour or something like that, but so you have to figure it out or spend money.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, we had a babysitter over here.</p>
<p>So yeah, it's expensive.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>So it's expensive.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, When I was a kid, we had babysitters all the time, but I think the price of babysitting has gone up a lot.</p>
<p>And so, yeah.</p>
<p>So there is kind of a crisis going on right now for parents in the U.S. and now the Surgeon General has chimed in on that, which is just really interesting.</p>
<p>Yes, So, yeah.</p>
<p>So community and then talking about community in Denver, yeah.</p>
<p>What would you say your community is like in your neighborhood?</p>
<p>You guys just moved in to your new space, yeah?</p>
<p>Not quite yet.</p>
<p>Not quite yet.</p>
<p>I'm still in a temporary space.</p>
<p>Yeah, But I will say that community can be a lot of different things, I guess.</p>
<p>So I don't have that neighborhood community yet, but through my son's school, through my daughter's school, there are certain things that have made me feel like there could be a tight-knit community in my area.</p>
<p>That's great.</p>
<p>Yeah, That's a really awesome, positive feeling.</p>
<p>And I have met some of my future neighbors.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>Neighbors, and I I think it's gonna be a tight-knit community.</p>
<p>I do good.</p>
<p>I'm glad to hear that.</p>
<p>That is awesome That's gonna be so good.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah Okay, Michelle we are back let's where do we go from here?</p>
<p>Where do we go from here?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, I mean this is great for connection because you can share so much about yourself.</p>
<p>Yes this expression, right?</p>
<p>I think just It's fun to talk about You're the people that you care about the people that you're close with, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, even it makes me think of my neighborhood growing up and just a simpler time Mm-hmm No social media and the community just playing outside with friends And so I think that people can really relate to this feeling of tight-knit so you can really share about A lot about yourself using this word, but I mean Lindsay any any thought any other thoughts and then we have different words Well that brings up the thought in my</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>Well, that brings up the thought in my head of you're right.</p>
<p>So I had the same upbringing no social media We spent a lot of time running around the neighborhood in the woods building forts doing what kids do outdoors, right?</p>
<p>But now a lot of kids are indoors on iPads and things and I wonder what tighten it is going to mean now Right, So is it the case that maybe kids will know their kids on their social media platforms better than their neighbors?</p>
<p>I mean is this term gonna go out of style or or what's gonna happen, right?</p>
<p>It's really really interesting This would be a fantastic conversation starter for our listeners to engage in Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah, No, I mean as as the world evolves our relationships change and we don't we don't know what's gonna happen I mean, it's a little sad to think about I'm trying to keep iPads away from my kids as long as possible Yeah, yeah, I'm sure I'm sure yeah Yeah, it's a little sad to think about but I mean, I hope that those you know the feeling</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>And I hope that those, you know, the feelings of just being close with the people around you, I hope that that never goes away.</p>
<p>I really hope so.</p>
<p>So assuming it's not going to go away, I think new ways of being connected are going to spring up.</p>
<p>But there are other ways we can say it, right?</p>
<p>There are other things our listeners might want to know to have that vocabulary range, right?</p>
<p>To not always say the same word.</p>
<p>So one of them, Michelle, is neighborly.</p>
<p>Yes, So neighborly.</p>
<p>So this is more, I think you can probably guess, more about your actual neighborhood.</p>
<p>So you could say, everyone I've met is extremely neighborly.</p>
<p>I'm excited to be in this community.</p>
<p>So that feeling of, you know, you're, you're, you could maybe go borrow a cup of milk from them.</p>
<p>So quaint, Michelle.</p>
<p>So quaint.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>No, but just like that closeness.</p>
<p>So if you need something, we're here for each other.</p>
<p>So neighborly is a word that you could use specifically about your neighborhood.</p>
<p>Yeah, Or for example, I live in a townhouse with, you know,</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>I live in a townhouse with four other attached townhouses.</p>
<p>They're not apartments, they're homes, but they're attached, right?</p>
<p>And sometimes we'll take in each other's garbage cans after garbage day, roll them down to the garage or something like that.</p>
<p>That's being neighborly.</p>
<p>That's very neighborly, very neighborly.</p>
<p>That's nice.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Okay, now we're getting more intense with this next one.</p>
<p>Yes, now we're getting way more intense.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What is it, Michelle?</p>
<p>It's inseparable.</p>
<p>Yes, much more intense.</p>
<p>This is, you're always together, right?</p>
<p>So you could say my friends from school and I are inseparable.</p>
<p>We are together all the time.</p>
<p>So you could have replaced that with tight-knit.</p>
<p>That would have been fine.</p>
<p>I think though inseparable is even more intense.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is totally different from neighborly, guys.</p>
<p>We're on a spectrum now.</p>
<p>We've moved to the other side of the spectrum.</p>
<p>Just bringing someone's garbage down, garbage can down is not inseparable.</p>
<p>Yes, Okay.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>Yes, Okay.</p>
<p>Just to make sure.</p>
<p>Well, right.</p>
<p>And you can be tight-knit, but not be inseparable.</p>
<p>Yes, So, like Lindsay saying, inseparable is more intense.</p>
<p>You know, I can say, oh, my family is tight-knit, but we're not inseparable.</p>
<p>And I think another key difference is with tight-knit, it's usually a – wouldn't you say it's usually about a group, like more than two people?</p>
<p>Or what do you think?</p>
<p>Is tight-knit necessarily for a group, two-plus, or three, minimum three?</p>
<p>I think it's mostly used that way, because I think if I was going to just be talking about one person, I might just say close.</p>
<p>Yeah, we're close, right?</p>
<p>Just the two of us are close, exactly.</p>
<p>And inseparable could be for two people, or it could be for, yeah, a family, a team, I guess.</p>
<p>A community?</p>
<p>I don't think so.</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>Unless it's like a cult or something, right?</p>
<p>We hope that's not happening.</p>
<p>Yeah, Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>But then we have the word devoted.</p>
<p>So this is more for, in my opinion,</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p>more for, in my opinion, used more for family or partners.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And here's a sample sentence.</p>
<p>We're so devoted to each other.</p>
<p>Very close.</p>
<p>Yeah, You could be like a devoted daughter, I guess, if your parents get sick and you're always over there helping them.</p>
<p>But generally, a romantic partner, I would say.</p>
<p>Yeah, Well, actually, you could be a devoted parent, right?</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>Yes, Real nuances here, Michelle.</p>
<p>Yeah, Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>And then the last one is loving.</p>
<p>Okay, so that's a little more emotional.</p>
<p>You're not going to really use this about your neighbors, I don't think.</p>
<p>So you could say she comes from a very loving family.</p>
<p>Yeah, In this case, the loving is just describing the family.</p>
<p>The family is a loving family.</p>
<p>What kind of family?</p>
<p>A happy family, a loving family, right?</p>
<p>Just an adjective.</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Just an adjective, okay?</p>
<p>Yes, Absolutely.</p>
<p>So, guys, before we get into the role play, we want to remind you to hit follow wherever you are listening to All Ears English.</p>
<p>Yeah, hit that follow button.</p>
<p>Michelle, let's get into a role play.</p>
<p>We are friends and we're talking about our upbringings, meaning what?</p>
<p>What is upbringing?</p>
<p>What does that word mean?</p>
<p>How we grew up.</p>
<p>That could be a key word for today.</p>
<p>Key word for today, guys.</p>
<p>If you are not using the iOS or Android app to consume All Ears English, you are missing a key piece because in the app, you get an opportunity to see the transcripts if you become a premium member.</p>
<p>And we do have a seven-day free trial.</p>
<p>So go check it out over there.</p>
<p>Yes, All right.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Let's do it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, I had an extremely tight-knit neighborhood growing up.</p>
<p>The kids in the neighborhood were all inseparable.</p>
<p>That must have been fun.</p>
<p>My community was very neighborly, but not necessarily that close.</p>
<p>But my family was very devoted.</p>
<p>Same.</p>
<p>My parents are very loving.</p>
<p>Yeah, Okay.</p>
<p>So yeah, I</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p>Kaitlin Luna, Ph.D.: Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I think that you are likely to have a conversation with this.</p>
<p>Maybe if you go away to college, you might talk about your relationship with your family.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, I remember parents weekend, my first year ever.</p>
<p>My experience was that I was really sad when they left.</p>
<p>Yeah, So, for our listeners, parents weekend is when, you know, as we said, we go away to college, we usually leave the state or even the region, which I did.</p>
<p>I went 500 miles away.</p>
<p>And then it's usually a weekend in September or October for freshmen where the parents come and visit you after a few months being away.</p>
<p>And usually, kids find that pretty emotional when your parents go home.</p>
<p>It's like separating again.</p>
<p>It's a whole thing, right?</p>
<p>It's such a dramatic thing we do here in this country.</p>
<p>Yes, it definitely is.</p>
<p>It definitely is.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I do remember that as well.</p>
<p>So, here we're talking about our upbringings.</p>
<p>And I said I had an extremely tight knit.</p>
<h2>Part-21</h2>
<p>I had an extremely tight-knit neighborhood growing up.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm, yeah.</p>
<p>And then you said the kids in the neighborhood were all inseparable.</p>
<p>So here we're using inseparable for more than two, and that works, that totally works, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Maybe you had a group of three or four friends that were always running around the neighborhood and just were very, very close.</p>
<p>So you could say inseparable.</p>
<p>And then you said my community was very neighborly, but not necessarily that close.</p>
<p>So that's interesting.</p>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>And can you be neighborly and not close?</p>
<p>So again, respectful, responsive.</p>
<p>Sometimes we'll coordinate with our neighbors to set up sprinklers or mow the lawn in front of our homes, things like that.</p>
<p>You communicate, you're respectful, but you're not necessarily gonna call them when you're crying over a breakup or something, right?</p>
<p>Right, yes, yes, yes, exactly.</p>
<p>And then you said about your family.</p>
<h2>Part-22</h2>
<p>And then you said about your family.</p>
<p>I said same.</p>
<p>My parents are... Oh, no.</p>
<p>I said... Wait.</p>
<p>Where am I? My family was very devoted.</p>
<p>Meaning devoted to each other.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yes, Devoted to the family unit.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Yes, Good.</p>
<p>And then I said same.</p>
<p>My parents are very loving.</p>
<p>So... Oh, nice.</p>
<p>Yeah, These are all really, really great vocabulary words to describe your relationship with your family.</p>
<p>Yeah, And I think our listeners are going to love that.</p>
<p>Michelle, where should our listeners go for another episode of All Ears English?</p>
<p>Guys, head on over to episode 2308 after this one, which was... This was fun.</p>
<p>How bougie.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>One slang expression to comment on taste.</p>
<p>Yes, I love it.</p>
<p>And what's the takeaway?</p>
<p>We've come up with some really interesting themes here of closeness within families, raising children, how this varies across the world.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Yeah, To me, that's one of the most interesting parts of the episode is just considering how this can be different in so many different regions of the world.</p>
<p>Even regions of the U.S., I think, could be as well, right?</p>
<h2>Part-23</h2>
<p>I think could be as well, right?</p>
<p>Maybe the cities are a little bit different from the more rural places.</p>
<p>Yeah, true, true.</p>
<p>So consider what your community is like, but definitely I think these words are really good for connection because you can use them to talk about your childhood, your relationships, just lots of different things that people can relate to and then they'll wanna share with you.</p>
<p>So I would say give these a try.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is a winning topic.</p>
<p>So guys, just as a final takeaway, you can start a conversation.</p>
<p>I would challenge all of our listeners to start a conversation on this topic sometime this week with a native speaker or with another student, right?</p>
<p>In our courses, we have our students connect with each other and we love that.</p>
<p>We love that connection.</p>
<p>The question that you can ask is, are you close with your family?</p>
<p>That's how we can get it started.</p>
<p>Are you close with your family?</p>
<p>And then we can use all these vocabulary words, okay?</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
