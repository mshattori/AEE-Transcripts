<p>Hello, Michelle, what's going on today? Hi, Lindsay.</p>
<p>Everything is good.</p>
<p>Everything is good.</p>
<p>Lindsay, what is the takeaway of this episode? This episode, Michelle, normally you asked me that at the end of the episode, I actually don't know yet.</p>
<p>We're gonna come up with it later at the end.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>OK, Well, I'll be thinking of it going along here.</p>
<p>I'm excited today because we have a unique question from a smart listener that we're excited to answer.</p>
<p>You know, we're excited.</p>
<p>We love these interesting, unique questions that you guys send in, you know.</p>
<p>So by the way, yeah, where can our listeners send their questions? What's the best to address? You can send it to support at all ears English dot com.</p>
<p>And, but there are a lot of places you can send your questions pretty much any place you can interact with us on youtube.</p>
<p>You can uh in your reviews anywhere you want to ask a question, you can ask a question.</p>
<p>But that is the email address.</p>
<p>You can also ask the question in your review of our I Os or Android app.</p>
<p>And the cool thing this summer about the I Os Android app is we have actually done an update recently and we've introduced new listening speeds and we had a listener ask for this more, many listeners asked for this.</p>
<p>Um So now you can listen to it at, you know, more granular speeds, not just 11.5 but you know, 1.31 0.4.</p>
<p>So double check it and go check it and you know, download the app and listen over there.</p>
<p>It's a different experience.</p>
<p>You get transcripts, you get keywords, you can save to your personal list.</p>
<p>Things you can't get anywhere else are in the app.</p>
<p>All right, cool.</p>
<p>OK, That's great.</p>
<p>So, let's go through this question, Lindsay, would you like to read it? Yeah.</p>
<p>This listener asked us this on youtube and um this is from Ha Fuck Khaled 4689.</p>
<p>They said thank you for your work and your effort.</p>
<p>Your team makes really great work.</p>
<p>I've been listening to your podcast since February and I guess I really like it.</p>
<p>Oh, thanks.</p>
<p>No, he said, since February, I guess, and I really like it.</p>
<p>He didn't say, I guess I, I guess that's fine.</p>
<p>I got confused.</p>
<p>Um So he said, I'm trying to listen to an episode every day to improve myself.</p>
<p>I really like the final part when Lindsay says, what's the takeaway for today? Can you talk about this expression and how it started in the US or the UK? Very nice.</p>
<p>Yes, this is a great question.</p>
<p>It's something that I didn't think about.</p>
<p>We, we didn't think about actually talking about w what? So the takeaway today will be the takeaway take.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now I'm getting, I'm gonna get myself all mixed up.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It's a good question though, isn't it Michelle? It is.</p>
<p>And thank you for the kind words and listening.</p>
<p>There's another episode our listeners could go back to um and you could go to check out one of our top episodes is your English.</p>
<p>Just so.</p>
<p>So go and check that one out after today's episode.</p>
<p>But in terms of the word takeaway, Michelle, we're not gonna go too much into the etymology today because that's not really the point of it.</p>
<p>Right, Right, Now, we're just gonna talk about this word and we're gonna really get into it so that we have a good takeaway at the end.</p>
<p>Um Lindsay.</p>
<p>So what, what when you are asking, what's the takeaway of the episode or when I ask you, whoever asks it, why, what are we saying? I'm saying? What is the most important thing for our listeners to remember? Right, Because I know we know, I mean, we, we're not gonna remember every single thing from every episode, but we want you to come away with a feeling, an idea, something you're aiming for a goal.</p>
<p>But I think it's related to the fact that we value human connection over any language skill because our goal is connection, not perfection.</p>
<p>So usually our takeaways are about connection and that's I like the idea how can we bring everything we've learned all the technicalities of the language? But what does it actually mean for our listeners as soon as they hit stop on their podcast player, go to work and have that first meeting in English.</p>
<p>What does it mean for them or on the street meeting someone at a party what does it actually mean? Yeah.</p>
<p>Right, It's kind of like putting, like, you're putting a bow on the episode right where we, it up and now we're just putting that final touch that you're gonna, that's gonna really stand out that you can walk away with.</p>
<p>Yes, we don't overdo it.</p>
<p>Like I'm thinking of the scene in love actually where he, he's wrapping up his piece of jewelry and he puts it a bow on it and then he puts it in a bag and then he puts the potpourri in.</p>
<p>Do you know? Yes, I, of course, I know that that's a funny thing.</p>
<p>And actually, yeah, I just thought of that the other day because I was, I was in a situation where I was in a rush and somebody was taking forever, I think with something, I forget what it was and I just kept on thinking about that.</p>
<p>It was making me laugh.</p>
<p>I, I wish I could remember what it was.</p>
<p>Um Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>It's incredible.</p>
<p>Um So again, it's the thing that we want to take away.</p>
<p>What do you, what's the most important part? So, I mean, yeah, we can't just end the episode.</p>
<p>We're not just going to say, OK, why we want to boil it down, right? That's a good expression.</p>
<p>That's a bonus for today's a bonus for today guys.</p>
<p>If you, we were talking about that app.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can get that boil it down as a bonus.</p>
<p>Yeah, we'll probably be highlighting that word in the app.</p>
<p>So guys, you'll be able to tap on it, save it to your keywords if you do listen inside the app with that premium membership, but boil it down just means what does it all really mean? What's the most essential piece piece of today's episode or today's message or today's meeting? Right, Right, And sometimes the takeaway is a little bit predictable and you can see it coming and sometimes Lindsay we fall and that episode takes twists and turns that we didn't expect.</p>
<p>And so honestly, when I'm planning the episodes and I, I always write takeaway at the bottom, but I, I usually kind of write something generic there or just, oh, this is blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>But I, no, it's not gonna be not generic.</p>
<p>Right, Right, We know that it's gonna change and we're gonna figure it out really at the end because it's a, it's a living breathing thing.</p>
<p>The episode, it doesn't, it's not all scripted out.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And so we're, we're constantly like deciding what the takeaway is.</p>
<p>So by the time we get to the end, it's dynamic.</p>
<p>Right, As you said, Michelle, we've, yeah, we've decided what matters the most for you guys, for our listeners.</p>
<p>What really matters for your, essentially for your happiness and your success in life because that's why we're here.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So most of the time the takeaway is not going to be a simple technicality of the language.</p>
<p>It's gonna be something bigger.</p>
<p>OK, Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>That's, that's what I was thinking.</p>
<p>So, every once in a while it's, oh, you use these words, give it a try, take a, you know, maybe, oh, try 11 at a time.</p>
<p>But a lot of times it's something more profound that comes out of it.</p>
<p>So, it is.</p>
<p>So, it's interesting when we, we might discover something together, it's something unique or different.</p>
<p>Um Because, and like I said, I don't even really plan them very much because I like it to happen in more of an organic way.</p>
<p>It's pretty organic.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's pretty organic.</p>
<p>Uh I'm not sure if other podcasts do this or not.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I'm listening to one health related podcast, diet and nutrition podcasts where they actually um they interview scientists and they, and he asks like five essential questions at the beginning of the episode that are kind of going to be the takeaways and the scientists have to answer in one word, which is hard to do for a scientist if you're a scientist and then they'll dive in.</p>
<p>So that gives the outline of the podcast episode and then the host will then reiterate everything that was said.</p>
<p>So there are different ways takeaways can be done, but the word takeaway does mean at the usually at the end, like, what are you leaving with? Right, Right, Right, Um So let's use this word in some sentences.</p>
<p>Um OK, so, so the takeaway is really that our team can handle it, but we agree that our time can be used in a better way, right? And obviously this is after probably a deeper meeting, right? We've discussed a lot here at work, for example.</p>
<p>Right, Yeah.</p>
<p>Or I didn't really understand all the details of the book, but the takeaway was crystal clear, right? Um And Lindsay, you were talking about you, you, you also said my takeaway when we were discussing the episode.</p>
<p>So sometimes people will say, well, that's my takeaway, right? So maybe you have a different takeaway than somebody else.</p>
<p>A 100% 100%.</p>
<p>And this is useful in business too.</p>
<p>What was your takeaway from the keynote speaker? A speech from the keynote speech, the keynote presentation.</p>
<p>What was your takeaway? My takeaway was this, it can be different.</p>
<p>That's important to know.</p>
<p>Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>OK, So we're gonna be using this when we go to conferences.</p>
<p>Um When we view anything even like a documentary, you watch a documentary.</p>
<p>Uh I just watched an interesting documentary over the weekend about, um uh let's see, the chemical company based in Delaware.</p>
<p>It's a Dupont.</p>
<p>Uh I don't know if you know anything about Dupont.</p>
<p>So there's been some lawsuits against them about chemicals getting into the ground in West Virginia and it covered that whole topic.</p>
<p>Kind of like an Erin Brockovich, kind of, that's what that's what it reminded me of when you were describing it.</p>
<p>It's basically the exact same, exact same template but great movie and a documentary, not a documentary, just a movie um, with, with, uh Mark Ruffalo and he's great in it.</p>
<p>I recommend it for sure.</p>
<p>But my takeaway was, you know, hey, we have to keep our eyes on these chemical companies and even now we have to keep an eye on the products that we're buying because these chemicals could be in them.</p>
<p>Right, Yeah.</p>
<p>Right, Ok.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>I'll have to, I'll have to check it out.</p>
<p>It's gonna freak me out.</p>
<p>So, so anyways, what, what are some other things we might say after we've watched the documentary, we have gone to a conference, we've attended a meeting at work.</p>
<p>I just want to expand the situations where we would use these.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh, there are so many, right? It's not just about our podcast, of course, but you could say the main idea, right.</p>
<p>So a lot of times this sounds a little bit academic to me.</p>
<p>Oh, the main idea, the idea of this chapter was, right? But it's also used another way.</p>
<p>So you could say the main idea is that we have to get everything organized by Tuesday at noon.</p>
<p>Yeah, it does sound very academic.</p>
<p>It feels like you're taking a test, an English test or something.</p>
<p>What was the main idea? What are the supporting details? Right? It feels a little too academic.</p>
<p>But yeah, you could throw it out there verbally speaking in everyday life or the bottom line.</p>
<p>I like this one though.</p>
<p>The bottom line, bottom line, bottom line, this is not easy, but we can do it.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Right, Right, Or somebody might say, oh, well, that's the bottom line.</p>
<p>Right, So a couple of ways you can use that, um, or the last one here is the moral, right? So this is uh in a way I would say this is fairly similar, but you could say the moral of the story is we can't let this get us down.</p>
<p>What do you think about that? Yeah, the moral of the story is we can't let this get us.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I think it's bringing in the idea of, yeah, having a more a takeaway from story books for Children or something and bringing that into the business world or the everyday communication world.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>It works.</p>
<p>Or also to add to that, the point is right.</p>
<p>The point is, yes.</p>
<p>Yes, Yes, Yes, That's a good one.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Should we do a role play Michelle now? Should we? Yes, let's do it.</p>
<p>So, here we are talking about a movie that we saw.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>The movie example.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Ok, here we go.</p>
<p>I just loved it.</p>
<p>It was beautiful.</p>
<p>It was incredible.</p>
<p>I think the moral was so beautifully, a lot highlighted at the end life is short and we have to enjoy it.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>That was my takeaway as well.</p>
<p>Bottom line, don't sweat the small stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They really let the audience know that that was the main idea.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Sounds like a great movie better than the one I watched.</p>
<p>A little more uplifting.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>Right, Um, all right.</p>
<p>So, you use the moral piece, you said? Yeah, it was incredible.</p>
<p>Or I did, I think the moral was so beautifully highlighted at the end.</p>
<p>Yes, that's what we love about going to the movies.</p>
<p>Uh, usually especially TV, shows, especially TV, shows from the nineties.</p>
<p>Uh We were just talking about this.</p>
<p>Remember we talked about that full house, right? Yeah, there's always a lesson and a lesson.</p>
<p>A moral.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Um And then I said, yep, that was my takeaway as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, I really like the use for our listeners to move to that 99% fluency level of my takeaway.</p>
<p>Your take away because it feels like another level of fluency guys.</p>
<p>So you're owning something fully and it's a vehicle to express your opinions, right? So if you write down anything today, this is your takeaway is write down, you know, this use of, you know, that was my takeaway or what was your takeaway? I love that.</p>
<p>Yes, That's a good way.</p>
<p>Yeah, that would be a great way to start a conversation with somebody 100% you can compare and contrast how, what you guys felt about something or what you noticed.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>And then you said bottom line, don't sweat the small stuff.</p>
<p>Yes, Yes, Also good.</p>
<p>And then you said, yeah, they really let the audience know that was the main idea.</p>
<p>And again, we said, main idea is good.</p>
<p>That's fine.</p>
<p>It can sound a little academic but it works, it works, it works, it works.</p>
<p>So Michelle, I know our listeners are waiting.</p>
<p>What is the takeaway for today? What is the good we got to think of a good one.</p>
<p>Um Well, yeah, a takeaway can be anything, anything that you want it to be, it, it can be more academic and it can be more obvious what a takeaway is.</p>
<p>OK, A B and C.</p>
<p>But a takeaway can also be the spin that you put on something that is very personal to you.</p>
<p>Yes, 100%.</p>
<p>And I think this is what good leaders do, this is what good communicators do.</p>
<p>This is what this is what people do for people to listen to them, right? You'll always put some kind of a spin or some kind of a value on things in a direction.</p>
<p>It's not, we're just the fact is people are not going to remember or they don't need to remember every little point you made, but they need to come away with something.</p>
<p>So if you are preparing a presentation, spend 80% of your time on the takeaway, I spend spend a huge chunk of your time on.</p>
<p>Yes, you need the supporting details.</p>
<p>But what is the last thing they're gonna hear from you? And what's the overarching idea? What really matters like? Why did you put out this piece of content? Whether it's your presentation? Why did you volunteer to speak? Why did you lead? What was the point of the meeting? We need these things to be effective communicators? Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, said Lindsay, well said, I agree.</p>
<p>Oh, man, wow, this was, this was a really rich question and I'm glad our listener asked it.</p>
<p>It was, it was interesting because I never thought about, oh, we say this all the time, but we never talked about exactly what it means.</p>
<p>So I'm glad our listener picked up on that.</p>
<p>That was a very fun question to answer.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Good stuff guys send in your questions and hit.</p>
