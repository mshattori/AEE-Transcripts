<p id="p-22">Hello, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-23">How are you?</p>
<p id="p-24">Good, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-25">How are you?</p>
<p id="p-26">I'm feeling great today.</p>
<p id="p-27">What are we getting into in our episode today?</p>
<p id="p-28">Okay, so I have a question.</p>
<p id="p-29">Is there any restaurant you love that's good and reliable pretty much almost 100% of the time?</p>
<p id="p-30">Oh, man.</p>
<p id="p-31">There used to be this little lobster roll shack that I used to like to go to in my parents' town of Situate right on the ocean.</p>
<p id="p-32">That was pretty much good 100% of the time, but it was an exception.</p>
<p id="p-33">Most places, you know, are more like hit or miss, right?</p>
<p id="p-34">Right, Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-35">Well, back near where I used to live, there was this Indian place called Karma Cafe.</p>
<p id="p-36">And to me, that was good.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-37">was good 100% of the time, I'm gonna say.</p>
<p id="p-38">It was so reliable and the service, everybody there is so friendly.</p>
<p id="p-39">We were the regulars there.</p>
<p id="p-40">So I would not say that place was hit or miss.</p>
<p id="p-41">I would say it was just hit.</p>
<p id="p-42">Just hit, hit all the time.</p>
<p id="p-43">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-44">What was your favorite dish there?</p>
<p id="p-45">What do you typically order when you go for Indian food?</p>
<p id="p-46">Ooh, I love the paneer makhani.</p>
<p id="p-47">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-48">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-49">I would say that's my favorite.</p>
<p id="p-50">I like any, I like all Indian.</p>
<p id="p-51">So good.</p>
<p id="p-52">What about you?</p>
<p id="p-53">What do you have when you have it?</p>
<p id="p-54">I like curry, any kind of curry.</p>
<p id="p-55">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-56">I made curry the other night.</p>
<p id="p-57">Ooh, how did it turn out, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-58">Actually, not bad.</p>
<p id="p-59">I was shocked.</p>
<p id="p-60">I mean, listen, it's not authentic or at a good restaurant or anything like that.</p>
<p id="p-61">But for me, it was pretty, I was proud.</p>
<p id="p-62">That's pretty awesome.</p>
<p id="p-63">Now, Michelle, you mentioned in our little natural conversation there, hit or miss, right?</p>
<p id="p-64">We mentioned that and you said it's always hit.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-65">Right, we mentioned that and you said it's always hit.</p>
<p id="p-66">Are we talking about taking a baseball bat to the restaurant?</p>
<p id="p-67">No, no, no, no, no, no, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-68">So this is this expression.</p>
<p id="p-69">Actually, we don't ever say something is, well, actually that's not true.</p>
<p id="p-70">We would say it's a hit.</p>
<p id="p-71">Oh, we do say it's a hit.</p>
<p id="p-72">That's true.</p>
<p id="p-73">But we don't say something is hit.</p>
<p id="p-74">And it's a little bit different.</p>
<p id="p-75">So I was just really making a joke.</p>
<p id="p-76">But the expression is hit or miss.</p>
<p id="p-77">And this is the opposite of something is always great.</p>
<p id="p-78">Well, no, it's not the opposite.</p>
<p id="p-79">It's kind of in the middle, right?</p>
<p id="p-80">The opposite would be it's always terrible.</p>
<p id="p-81">But if something is hit or miss, it's basically it's inconsistent in terms of the results.</p>
<p id="p-82">And, you know, we kind of don't know what we're going to get.</p>
<p id="p-83">Is it going to be great?</p>
<p id="p-84">Is it going to be not so good?</p>
<p id="p-85">So what do you think about this, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-86">Do you use this?</p>
<p id="p-87">Well, when I think about this, you know how we have these weird memories from childhood?</p>
<p id="p-88">It's kind of like scenes that we remember.</p>
<p id="p-89">I remember there was a store in my town.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-90">I remember there was a store in my town, and that was the name of the store.</p>
<p id="p-91">It was like a retail shop, like dresses.</p>
<p id="p-92">And I'm thinking, why would you name?</p>
<p id="p-93">And now I didn't realize it then, but now when I think about it, why would you name your shop hit or miss?</p>
<p id="p-94">That's funny.</p>
<p id="p-95">That's really funny.</p>
<p id="p-96">It was a thing in the 90s, you know?</p>
<p id="p-97">It was the 90s.</p>
<p id="p-98">The 90s, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-99">So, but yeah, I would say that this expression comes up pretty frequently.</p>
<p id="p-100">So this is going to be super useful to our listeners.</p>
<p id="p-101">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-102">And Michelle, do you say this a lot yourself?</p>
<p id="p-103">Is this one of your go-tos?</p>
<p id="p-104">I would say so.</p>
<p id="p-105">I think that it comes up pretty naturally.</p>
<p id="p-106">How about for you?</p>
<p id="p-107">I would say so, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-108">I don't use it a ton, but I think, I mean, I know it.</p>
<p id="p-109">I've heard it around.</p>
<p id="p-110">It's an important one for our listeners to know.</p>
<p id="p-111">Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-112">Yeah, you could say so.</p>
<p id="p-113">So guys, before we get into it a little bit more, we want to give you some results from a poll we did on Spotify.</p>
<p id="p-114">It was episode 2356.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-115">It was episode 2356, which was learn some new English while you're at it.</p>
<p id="p-116">I remember that one, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-117">And yeah, so guys, if you haven't heard this one, this is really good.</p>
<p id="p-118">It's about while you're at it.</p>
<p id="p-119">So the question was for the poll was, do you piecemeal tasks, right?</p>
<p id="p-120">So basically, do you do things just in smaller chunks or do you prefer to get everything done at once?</p>
<p id="p-121">So Lindsay, would you like to read the results for us?</p>
<p id="p-122">Yes, this is very interesting because we were talking in that episode about our own styles, Michelle, right?</p>
<p id="p-123">Yeah, And now remind me what your style is before I announce the results.</p>
<p id="p-124">It's funny because I forget.</p>
<p id="p-125">I want to say piecemeal.</p>
<p id="p-126">Yeah, I think you said piecemeal.</p>
<p id="p-127">We were talking about cleaning, talking about... Right, right, right.</p>
<p id="p-128">And I'm actually kind of surprised that most of the audience is on my side.</p>
<p id="p-129">So 68% of the audience wants to do things all at once.</p>
<p id="p-130">Like let's say you're going to clean your house.</p>
<p id="p-131">You just get it done in a...</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-132">clean your house.</p>
<p id="p-133">You just get it done in a three-hour sprint and not do it again for two weeks or a week.</p>
<p id="p-134">And then 31% want a piecemeal.</p>
<p id="p-135">You had said in that episode you want to just pick things up every evening, a little bit at a time.</p>
<p id="p-136">But to me, that makes it feel like you're just cleaning every night.</p>
<p id="p-137">All the time.</p>
<p id="p-138">Yeah, Yeah, but then it gets so overwhelming if you leave everything.</p>
<p id="p-139">Like even for me when I leave the laundry for a few days, I was being so good about the laundry and I was putting everything away on the day of.</p>
<p id="p-140">But I was doing laundry like every single day.</p>
<p id="p-141">And now I've left it and that pile of days and days of laundry to me, it's not really worth the smaller amount of work, you know?</p>
<p id="p-142">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-143">For me, I like to see results.</p>
<p id="p-144">Like if I vacuum, I want the rug to be dirty so I can see it be very clean.</p>
<p id="p-145">Oh my God, that's so funny.</p>
<p id="p-146">But maybe because you have two kids, you have a lot more laundry than I do in my house, so maybe that's what it is.</p>
<p id="p-147">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-148">Maybe.</p>
<p id="p-149">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-150">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-151">All right, so let's talk about hit or miss.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-152">Let's talk about hit or miss.</p>
<p id="p-153">So what kinds of things do we use this for?</p>
<p id="p-154">I mean, this is for, I would say, a lot of opinions.</p>
<p id="p-155">I mean, we were talking about restaurants, so that's a common one.</p>
<p id="p-156">Or you were at a retail store.</p>
<p id="p-157">Who names their store that?</p>
<p id="p-158">I have no idea.</p>
<p id="p-159">But yeah, I think this is good when you make a recommendation to someone and then you're trying to pull back a little bit and say, oh, it's kind of hit or miss.</p>
<p id="p-160">You could try it, right?</p>
<p id="p-161">Right, right.</p>
<p id="p-162">Yeah, I mean, it could be used for really a lot of things.</p>
<p id="p-163">I mean, it could even be about like a director's movies, right?</p>
<p id="p-164">So, oh, I like this director, but sometimes I find his material is hit or miss.</p>
<p id="p-165">Yeah, that's a good one.</p>
<p id="p-166">Musicians, right?</p>
<p id="p-167">So if you go to a concert, maybe there's one.</p>
<p id="p-168">There's a singer you like and you went to one concert, which was great.</p>
<p id="p-169">And then, you know, the other one wasn't so good.</p>
<p id="p-170">So you say in concert, he's hit or miss.</p>
<p id="p-171">Right, Yeah, Yeah, exactly.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-172">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-173">So let's do some examples.</p>
<p id="p-174">All right, you want to start with the first one?</p>
<p id="p-175">Sure, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-176">I really think we should go with the Marriott for the trip.</p>
<p id="p-177">The other place is always hit or miss, and I just want to know I'm in a good hotel.</p>
<p id="p-178">Yeah, I understand that feeling a little more as I'm getting older, actually.</p>
<p id="p-179">Yeah, I mean, so maybe you've stayed at a lot of Marriotts before and you find them to be reliable, whatever you think of Marriott.</p>
<p id="p-180">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-181">I just use this for example.</p>
<p id="p-182">And then there's another chain or another smaller hotel that's hit or miss, and you just want to have a good place that you can trust.</p>
<p id="p-183">Right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-184">A comfortable bed.</p>
<p id="p-185">And yeah, sometimes we're in this kind of mood, right?</p>
<p id="p-186">We want to go for the hit, what we know is going to be a hit.</p>
<p id="p-187">Here's another example.</p>
<p id="p-188">Her books are kind of hit or miss.</p>
<p id="p-189">I've liked a lot of them, but there have been some duds too.</p>
<p id="p-190">Now, dud, that is a good bonus for our listeners today, Michelle.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-191">That is a good bonus for our listeners today, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-192">Yes, I'm going to add it to the list.</p>
<p id="p-193">So yeah, a dud is not so good.</p>
<p id="p-194">Yeah, a dud is a specific, yeah, not so good.</p>
<p id="p-195">The thing just turns out to not be great.</p>
<p id="p-196">Maybe you had high expectations for it and it just kind of fell flat.</p>
<p id="p-197">It fell flat.</p>
<p id="p-198">Yeah, fell flat.</p>
<p id="p-199">Yeah, so yeah, there are some authors maybe you like some of their books and then do you ever read one, like do you have any specific authors that you read a lot of their books?</p>
<p id="p-200">Not really.</p>
<p id="p-201">No, I go more from book to book.</p>
<p id="p-202">It's more about the cover.</p>
<p id="p-203">It's usually about the cover.</p>
<p id="p-204">Yeah, Oh, me too.</p>
<p id="p-205">Oh, I'm terrible.</p>
<p id="p-206">I definitely judge books by the cover.</p>
<p id="p-207">Yeah, I know we shouldn't do that, right?</p>
<p id="p-208">But there are some of them are so beautiful.</p>
<p id="p-209">They are, they are.</p>
<p id="p-210">Yeah, it's about the title or maybe just there's a recommended book list or maybe it's just on my bookshelf and I needed something to read.</p>
<p id="p-211">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-212">Yeah, What's the next example, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-213">All right.</p>
<p id="p-214">The next one is that restaurant's food is hit or miss.</p>
<p id="p-215">I think we should go somewhere else this time.</p>
<p id="p-216">Yeah, So yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-217">I mean, is hit or miss, here's a good question.</p>
<p id="p-218">Does it usually follow with we should try it or we shouldn't try it?</p>
<p id="p-219">Well, looking at my examples, I would say that it ends up being more of a negative introduction.</p>
<p id="p-220">So maybe I take back what I said earlier, which is that we would say it when we recommend something.</p>
<p id="p-221">I may not do that because... Right, It does have a more of a... It's not so much of a... Yeah, It's more of kind of this emphasis on the miss part than the hit.</p>
<p id="p-222">Yeah, kind of.</p>
<p id="p-223">Right?</p>
<p id="p-224">In a way, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-225">So I'm going to recommend a restaurant if you're coming to my town, which I know is going to be great, consistently great, right?</p>
<p id="p-226">Right, You don't want to recommend something and then say, oh, it's hit or miss.</p>
<p id="p-227">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-228">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-229">Any examples in your life, Michelle, of something that has been hit or miss?</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-230">Anything else you can think of?</p>
<p id="p-231">Hit or miss.</p>
<p id="p-232">Ooh, I'm trying to think.</p>
<p id="p-233">Well, maybe next time we'll come back to it.</p>
<p id="p-234">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-235">Okay, how about this?</p>
<p id="p-236">Like some exercise classes I've tried, like this is a little bit different, but maybe the times I've tried yoga, okay?</p>
<p id="p-237">Because it can be very different depending on your instructor or what kind of yoga.</p>
<p id="p-238">So I could say like, oh, the classes have been, like not necessarily that I'm talking about one place's yoga class, but sometimes I could say my experiences hit or miss with yoga.</p>
<p id="p-239">That makes sense.</p>
<p id="p-240">That makes sense.</p>
<p id="p-241">And another example I just thought of is ski terrain.</p>
<p id="p-242">So I ski a lot on the weekends.</p>
<p id="p-243">Certain mountains can be hit or miss in terms of the terrain.</p>
<p id="p-244">Certain mountains don't groom as much, so they're more prone to being icy when the conditions aren't good overnight.</p>
<p id="p-245">If it rains.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-246">aren't good overnight.</p>
<p id="p-247">If it rains or something and then it ices over, you're skiing on a skating rink, right?</p>
<p id="p-248">So it's pretty hit or miss.</p>
<p id="p-249">Conditions are pretty hit or miss.</p>
<p id="p-250">Maybe try a different mountain.</p>
<p id="p-251">That's an example.</p>
<p id="p-252">That's a good example.</p>

<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-256">Work is kind of inconsistent and I don't know why.</p>
<p id="p-257">Yeah, And what we mean here is in terms of the quality.</p>
<p id="p-258">The quality.</p>
<p id="p-259">This is about quality, right?</p>
<p id="p-260">This one is also a fun one.</p>
<p id="p-261">Spotty.</p>
<p id="p-262">Now, I would say most of the time we use this for the internet, right?</p>
<p id="p-263">Yeah, that's my reality right now.</p>
<p id="p-264">Or service, like some sort of, you know, your phone, your internet, whatever it is.</p>
<p id="p-265">Would you use this about anything else?</p>
<p id="p-266">Not really.</p>
<p id="p-267">Yeah, I think the coverage, maybe the phone lines, like very similar to the internet, right?</p>
<p id="p-268">The coverage is spotty.</p>
<p id="p-269">The internet is spotty.</p>
<p id="p-270">You can't rely on it, right?</p>
<p id="p-271">Right, right, right.</p>
<p id="p-272">So, yeah, the internet here is spotty.</p>
<p id="p-273">Make sure you have a backup.</p>
<p id="p-274">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-275">And that runs into the next one, which I already used this word.</p>
<p id="p-276">Yeah, Unreliable.</p>
<p id="p-277">So, perfect.</p>
<p id="p-278">I can't deal with a carpool that's unreliable.</p>
<p id="p-279">I need to get to work on time.</p>
<p id="p-280">Oh, my gosh, no.</p>
<p id="p-281">Yeah, That's probably why a lot of people drive to work, right?</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-282">why a lot of people drive to work, right?</p>
<p id="p-283">Yes, unreliable, interesting.</p>
<p id="p-284">I mean, what do you think about, I mean, are there times do you think in your life where you really want to just always know that something is going to be a sure thing?</p>
<p id="p-285">Or are you sometimes just okay with, oh, this is hit or miss, it could be a hit, so I'm going to give it a try.</p>
<p id="p-286">Well, I think it's important to, I guess when I'm thinking of learning, so I'm learning tango now.</p>
<p id="p-287">Did I tell you that, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-288">I'm taking tango classes.</p>
<p id="p-289">Yes, you did.</p>
<p id="p-290">How's it going?</p>
<p id="p-291">Well, I'm proud to say I've graduated to tango two, so I'm in tango two now, yes.</p>
<p id="p-292">And also I was at the gym this week and the instructor said, you know, the key to success is repetition, just repetition.</p>
<p id="p-293">So I think if we think about our own actions, it's important to be consistent, to make sure we are reliable with what we're doing.</p>
<p id="p-294">Go to the class, repeat the steps, do the reps.</p>
<p id="p-295">That is kind of a huge unsung hero.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-296">Huge, like unsung hero of success is repetition, consistency.</p>
<p id="p-297">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-298">Yeah, I've definitely find that too with things I'm learning.</p>
<p id="p-299">I'm actually starting to sing again.</p>
<p id="p-300">Oh, Michelle, that's awesome.</p>
<p id="p-301">Yes, My friend and I are practicing to start doing our first open mics.</p>
<p id="p-302">So yeah, so, but yeah, with like open mics, I could say, oh, I don't know, you know, there are some in the area, but open mics can be kind of hit or miss, right?</p>
<p id="p-303">Sometimes they're really great.</p>
<p id="p-304">There's like a lot of people that's a good vibe, or sometimes it's kind of, I don't know, awkward.</p>
<p id="p-305">Share with us, with the audience, when you have your first one and how it goes.</p>
<p id="p-306">That is so exciting.</p>
<p id="p-307">I will.</p>
<p id="p-308">Yeah, so I'm really happy about that.</p>
<p id="p-309">All right, let's do a role play.</p>
<p id="p-310">Let's do it.</p>
<p id="p-311">So here I'm asking you for coffee shop suggestions in your town.</p>
<p id="p-312">Maybe I came to visit you in your town.</p>
<p id="p-313">I have to get a coffee.</p>
<p id="p-314">So let's see.</p>
<p id="p-315">All right.</p>
<p id="p-316">All right.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-317">I saw a place on Google called Preppy Coffee.</p>
<p id="p-318">Is it any good?</p>
<p id="p-319">Kind of hit or miss.</p>
<p id="p-320">I like their cappuccinos, but the atmosphere isn't always great.</p>
<p id="p-321">Try Love My Coffee down the street.</p>
<p id="p-322">I don't want you wasting your money on somewhere that's unreliable.</p>
<p id="p-323">Plus, the internet is always spotty, and I know you need to do work.</p>
<p id="p-324">Ooh, thanks.</p>
<p id="p-325">Yeah, I don't want to go to a place that's quality is inconsistent.</p>
<p id="p-326">Yeah, go to a place whose quality is inconsistent.</p>
<p id="p-327">Yeah, I know.</p>
<p id="p-328">That's a little weird.</p>
<p id="p-329">Yeah, I know.</p>
<p id="p-330">That was weird.</p>
<p id="p-331">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-332">Where the quality is inconsistent.</p>
<p id="p-333">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-334">Yeah, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-335">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-336">And this is a typical conversation you might have.</p>
<p id="p-337">Maybe I came to visit you, but I have to work during the day while you're working.</p>
<p id="p-338">I work remote.</p>
<p id="p-339">I'm looking for a coffee shop to park in for a while, right?</p>
<p id="p-340">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-341">Perfect.</p>
<p id="p-342">All right, so let's go through it, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-343">What did I say first?</p>
<p id="p-344">What did you say?</p>
<p id="p-345">So I said, you said, is this coffee place any good?</p>
<p id="p-346">And I said, um, it's kind of hit or miss.</p>
<p id="p-347">And I just wanted to highlight that because some</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p id="p-348">And I just wanted to highlight that because sometimes we, yeah, I could say, um, it's hit or miss, but sometimes we say kind of hit or miss, kind of hit or miss, right?</p>
<p id="p-349">So incredibly natural.</p>
<p id="p-350">We do this a lot when we, I think the reason we do that is because we're trying to soften the blow for the coffee shop.</p>
<p id="p-351">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-352">And then you said, I don't want you wasting your money on somewhere that's unreliable.</p>
<p id="p-353">Now, Michelle, that gave me a great idea for another episode.</p>
<p id="p-354">I don't want you doing something.</p>
<p id="p-355">I don't want you doing this.</p>
<p id="p-356">Fantastic.</p>
<p id="p-357">A lot of context in which we use that.</p>
<p id="p-358">Guys, hit the follow button to get that episode coming up soon.</p>
<p id="p-359">All right.</p>
<p id="p-360">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-361">Good idea, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-362">All right.</p>
<p id="p-363">And then I said, plus, the internet is always spotty.</p>
<p id="p-364">So something specifically that we use for some sort of connection.</p>
<p id="p-365">And I know you need to do work.</p>
<p id="p-366">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-367">So inconsistent again, right?</p>
<p id="p-368">Inconsistent quality.</p>
<p id="p-369">And then</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p id="p-370">inconsistent quality.</p>
<p id="p-371">And then I said, thanks.</p>
<p id="p-372">Yeah, I don't want to go to a place where the quality is inconsistent.</p>
<p id="p-373">Yes, and that just tops off the conversation.</p>
<p id="p-374">Right?</p>
<p id="p-375">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-376">All right.</p>
<p id="p-377">Well, yeah, this was fun.</p>
<p id="p-378">And guys, we also want to remind you, don't be hit or miss when you listen to All Ears English.</p>
<p id="p-379">You got to hit follow so that you can be there 100% of the time.</p>
<p id="p-380">We don't want you to be inconsistent with your English learning.</p>
<p id="p-381">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-382">And for a takeaway, I mean, think about times in your life where consistent quality matters.</p>
<p id="p-383">Maybe if you have your own business or if you provide a service, even if you work for a company, what would people think about your work, right?</p>
<p id="p-384">This is a good inquiry into ourselves.</p>
<p id="p-385">Is your quality consistent of what you're delivering on a daily basis?</p>
<p id="p-386">Good to have that inquiry.</p>
<p id="p-387">Don't you think?</p>
<p id="p-388">Yeah, I like that.</p>
<p id="p-389">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-390">All right, guys.</p>
<p id="p-391">Well, this was fun.</p>
<p id="p-392">And Lindsay, have a good day and I'll see you in the next one.</p>
<p id="p-393">All right.</p>
<p id="p-394">Bye, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-395">Have a good one.</p>
