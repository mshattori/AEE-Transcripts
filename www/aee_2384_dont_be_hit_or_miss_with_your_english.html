<p>Hello, Michelle.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>Good, Lindsay.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>I'm feeling great today.</p>
<p>What are we getting into in our episode today?</p>
<p>Okay, so I have a question.</p>
<p>Is there any restaurant you love that's good and reliable pretty much almost 100% of the time?</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>There used to be this little lobster roll shack that I used to like to go to in my parents' town of Situate right on the ocean.</p>
<p>That was pretty much good 100% of the time, but it was an exception.</p>
<p>Most places, you know, are more like hit or miss, right?</p>
<p>Right, Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, back near where I used to live, there was this Indian place called Karma Cafe.</p>
<p>And to me, that was good.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>was good 100% of the time, I'm gonna say.</p>
<p>It was so reliable and the service, everybody there is so friendly.</p>
<p>We were the regulars there.</p>
<p>So I would not say that place was hit or miss.</p>
<p>I would say it was just hit.</p>
<p>Just hit, hit all the time.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>What was your favorite dish there?</p>
<p>What do you typically order when you go for Indian food?</p>
<p>Ooh, I love the paneer makhani.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>I would say that's my favorite.</p>
<p>I like any, I like all Indian.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>What do you have when you have it?</p>
<p>I like curry, any kind of curry.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I made curry the other night.</p>
<p>Ooh, how did it turn out, Michelle?</p>
<p>Actually, not bad.</p>
<p>I was shocked.</p>
<p>I mean, listen, it's not authentic or at a good restaurant or anything like that.</p>
<p>But for me, it was pretty, I was proud.</p>
<p>That's pretty awesome.</p>
<p>Now, Michelle, you mentioned in our little natural conversation there, hit or miss, right?</p>
<p>We mentioned that and you said it's always hit.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>Right, we mentioned that and you said it's always hit.</p>
<p>Are we talking about taking a baseball bat to the restaurant?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, no, exactly.</p>
<p>So this is this expression.</p>
<p>Actually, we don't ever say something is, well, actually that's not true.</p>
<p>We would say it's a hit.</p>
<p>Oh, we do say it's a hit.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>But we don't say something is hit.</p>
<p>And it's a little bit different.</p>
<p>So I was just really making a joke.</p>
<p>But the expression is hit or miss.</p>
<p>And this is the opposite of something is always great.</p>
<p>Well, no, it's not the opposite.</p>
<p>It's kind of in the middle, right?</p>
<p>The opposite would be it's always terrible.</p>
<p>But if something is hit or miss, it's basically it's inconsistent in terms of the results.</p>
<p>And, you know, we kind of don't know what we're going to get.</p>
<p>Is it going to be great?</p>
<p>Is it going to be not so good?</p>
<p>So what do you think about this, Lindsay?</p>
<p>Do you use this?</p>
<p>Well, when I think about this, you know how we have these weird memories from childhood?</p>
<p>It's kind of like scenes that we remember.</p>
<p>I remember there was a store in my town.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>I remember there was a store in my town, and that was the name of the store.</p>
<p>It was like a retail shop, like dresses.</p>
<p>And I'm thinking, why would you name?</p>
<p>And now I didn't realize it then, but now when I think about it, why would you name your shop hit or miss?</p>
<p>That's funny.</p>
<p>That's really funny.</p>
<p>It was a thing in the 90s, you know?</p>
<p>It was the 90s.</p>
<p>The 90s, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So, but yeah, I would say that this expression comes up pretty frequently.</p>
<p>So this is going to be super useful to our listeners.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And Michelle, do you say this a lot yourself?</p>
<p>Is this one of your go-tos?</p>
<p>I would say so.</p>
<p>I think that it comes up pretty naturally.</p>
<p>How about for you?</p>
<p>I would say so, yeah.</p>
<p>I don't use it a ton, but I think, I mean, I know it.</p>
<p>I've heard it around.</p>
<p>It's an important one for our listeners to know.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, you could say so.</p>
<p>So guys, before we get into it a little bit more, we want to give you some results from a poll we did on Spotify.</p>
<p>It was episode 2356.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>It was episode 2356, which was learn some new English while you're at it.</p>
<p>I remember that one, Lindsay.</p>
<p>And yeah, so guys, if you haven't heard this one, this is really good.</p>
<p>It's about while you're at it.</p>
<p>So the question was for the poll was, do you piecemeal tasks, right?</p>
<p>So basically, do you do things just in smaller chunks or do you prefer to get everything done at once?</p>
<p>So Lindsay, would you like to read the results for us?</p>
<p>Yes, this is very interesting because we were talking in that episode about our own styles, Michelle, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, And now remind me what your style is before I announce the results.</p>
<p>It's funny because I forget.</p>
<p>I want to say piecemeal.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think you said piecemeal.</p>
<p>We were talking about cleaning, talking about... Right, right, right.</p>
<p>And I'm actually kind of surprised that most of the audience is on my side.</p>
<p>So 68% of the audience wants to do things all at once.</p>
<p>Like let's say you're going to clean your house.</p>
<p>You just get it done in a...</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>clean your house.</p>
<p>You just get it done in a three-hour sprint and not do it again for two weeks or a week.</p>
<p>And then 31% want a piecemeal.</p>
<p>You had said in that episode you want to just pick things up every evening, a little bit at a time.</p>
<p>But to me, that makes it feel like you're just cleaning every night.</p>
<p>All the time.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, but then it gets so overwhelming if you leave everything.</p>
<p>Like even for me when I leave the laundry for a few days, I was being so good about the laundry and I was putting everything away on the day of.</p>
<p>But I was doing laundry like every single day.</p>
<p>And now I've left it and that pile of days and days of laundry to me, it's not really worth the smaller amount of work, you know?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>For me, I like to see results.</p>
<p>Like if I vacuum, I want the rug to be dirty so I can see it be very clean.</p>
<p>Oh my God, that's so funny.</p>
<p>But maybe because you have two kids, you have a lot more laundry than I do in my house, so maybe that's what it is.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>All right, so let's talk about hit or miss.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>Let's talk about hit or miss.</p>
<p>So what kinds of things do we use this for?</p>
<p>I mean, this is for, I would say, a lot of opinions.</p>
<p>I mean, we were talking about restaurants, so that's a common one.</p>
<p>Or you were at a retail store.</p>
<p>Who names their store that?</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>But yeah, I think this is good when you make a recommendation to someone and then you're trying to pull back a little bit and say, oh, it's kind of hit or miss.</p>
<p>You could try it, right?</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it could be used for really a lot of things.</p>
<p>I mean, it could even be about like a director's movies, right?</p>
<p>So, oh, I like this director, but sometimes I find his material is hit or miss.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's a good one.</p>
<p>Musicians, right?</p>
<p>So if you go to a concert, maybe there's one.</p>
<p>There's a singer you like and you went to one concert, which was great.</p>
<p>And then, you know, the other one wasn't so good.</p>
<p>So you say in concert, he's hit or miss.</p>
<p>Right, Yeah, Yeah, exactly.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So let's do some examples.</p>
<p>All right, you want to start with the first one?</p>
<p>Sure, here we go.</p>
<p>I really think we should go with the Marriott for the trip.</p>
<p>The other place is always hit or miss, and I just want to know I'm in a good hotel.</p>
<p>Yeah, I understand that feeling a little more as I'm getting older, actually.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, so maybe you've stayed at a lot of Marriotts before and you find them to be reliable, whatever you think of Marriott.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I just use this for example.</p>
<p>And then there's another chain or another smaller hotel that's hit or miss, and you just want to have a good place that you can trust.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>A comfortable bed.</p>
<p>And yeah, sometimes we're in this kind of mood, right?</p>
<p>We want to go for the hit, what we know is going to be a hit.</p>
<p>Here's another example.</p>
<p>Her books are kind of hit or miss.</p>
<p>I've liked a lot of them, but there have been some duds too.</p>
<p>Now, dud, that is a good bonus for our listeners today, Michelle.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>That is a good bonus for our listeners today, Michelle.</p>
<p>Yes, I'm going to add it to the list.</p>
<p>So yeah, a dud is not so good.</p>
<p>Yeah, a dud is a specific, yeah, not so good.</p>
<p>The thing just turns out to not be great.</p>
<p>Maybe you had high expectations for it and it just kind of fell flat.</p>
<p>It fell flat.</p>
<p>Yeah, fell flat.</p>
<p>Yeah, so yeah, there are some authors maybe you like some of their books and then do you ever read one, like do you have any specific authors that you read a lot of their books?</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>No, I go more from book to book.</p>
<p>It's more about the cover.</p>
<p>It's usually about the cover.</p>
<p>Yeah, Oh, me too.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm terrible.</p>
<p>I definitely judge books by the cover.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know we shouldn't do that, right?</p>
<p>But there are some of them are so beautiful.</p>
<p>They are, they are.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's about the title or maybe just there's a recommended book list or maybe it's just on my bookshelf and I needed something to read.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>Yeah, What's the next example, Michelle?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>The next one is that restaurant's food is hit or miss.</p>
<p>I think we should go somewhere else this time.</p>
<p>Yeah, So yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, is hit or miss, here's a good question.</p>
<p>Does it usually follow with we should try it or we shouldn't try it?</p>
<p>Well, looking at my examples, I would say that it ends up being more of a negative introduction.</p>
<p>So maybe I take back what I said earlier, which is that we would say it when we recommend something.</p>
<p>I may not do that because... Right, It does have a more of a... It's not so much of a... Yeah, It's more of kind of this emphasis on the miss part than the hit.</p>
<p>Yeah, kind of.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>In a way, yeah.</p>
<p>So I'm going to recommend a restaurant if you're coming to my town, which I know is going to be great, consistently great, right?</p>
<p>Right, You don't want to recommend something and then say, oh, it's hit or miss.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Any examples in your life, Michelle, of something that has been hit or miss?</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>Anything else you can think of?</p>
<p>Hit or miss.</p>
<p>Ooh, I'm trying to think.</p>
<p>Well, maybe next time we'll come back to it.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, how about this?</p>
<p>Like some exercise classes I've tried, like this is a little bit different, but maybe the times I've tried yoga, okay?</p>
<p>Because it can be very different depending on your instructor or what kind of yoga.</p>
<p>So I could say like, oh, the classes have been, like not necessarily that I'm talking about one place's yoga class, but sometimes I could say my experiences hit or miss with yoga.</p>
<p>That makes sense.</p>
<p>That makes sense.</p>
<p>And another example I just thought of is ski terrain.</p>
<p>So I ski a lot on the weekends.</p>
<p>Certain mountains can be hit or miss in terms of the terrain.</p>
<p>Certain mountains don't groom as much, so they're more prone to being icy when the conditions aren't good overnight.</p>
<p>If it rains.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>aren't good overnight.</p>
<p>If it rains or something and then it ices over, you're skiing on a skating rink, right?</p>
<p>So it's pretty hit or miss.</p>
<p>Conditions are pretty hit or miss.</p>
<p>Maybe try a different mountain.</p>
<p>That's an example.</p>
<p>That's a good example.</p>
<p>That's a good example.</p>
<p>All right.</p>

<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>Work is kind of inconsistent and I don't know why.</p>
<p>Yeah, And what we mean here is in terms of the quality.</p>
<p>The quality.</p>
<p>This is about quality, right?</p>
<p>This one is also a fun one.</p>
<p>Spotty.</p>
<p>Now, I would say most of the time we use this for the internet, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, that's my reality right now.</p>
<p>Or service, like some sort of, you know, your phone, your internet, whatever it is.</p>
<p>Would you use this about anything else?</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the coverage, maybe the phone lines, like very similar to the internet, right?</p>
<p>The coverage is spotty.</p>
<p>The internet is spotty.</p>
<p>You can't rely on it, right?</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>So, yeah, the internet here is spotty.</p>
<p>Make sure you have a backup.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And that runs into the next one, which I already used this word.</p>
<p>Yeah, Unreliable.</p>
<p>So, perfect.</p>
<p>I can't deal with a carpool that's unreliable.</p>
<p>I need to get to work on time.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh, no.</p>
<p>Yeah, That's probably why a lot of people drive to work, right?</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>why a lot of people drive to work, right?</p>
<p>Yes, unreliable, interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, what do you think about, I mean, are there times do you think in your life where you really want to just always know that something is going to be a sure thing?</p>
<p>Or are you sometimes just okay with, oh, this is hit or miss, it could be a hit, so I'm going to give it a try.</p>
<p>Well, I think it's important to, I guess when I'm thinking of learning, so I'm learning tango now.</p>
<p>Did I tell you that, Michelle?</p>
<p>I'm taking tango classes.</p>
<p>Yes, you did.</p>
<p>How's it going?</p>
<p>Well, I'm proud to say I've graduated to tango two, so I'm in tango two now, yes.</p>
<p>And also I was at the gym this week and the instructor said, you know, the key to success is repetition, just repetition.</p>
<p>So I think if we think about our own actions, it's important to be consistent, to make sure we are reliable with what we're doing.</p>
<p>Go to the class, repeat the steps, do the reps.</p>
<p>That is kind of a huge unsung hero.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>Huge, like unsung hero of success is repetition, consistency.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, I've definitely find that too with things I'm learning.</p>
<p>I'm actually starting to sing again.</p>
<p>Oh, Michelle, that's awesome.</p>
<p>Yes, My friend and I are practicing to start doing our first open mics.</p>
<p>So yeah, so, but yeah, with like open mics, I could say, oh, I don't know, you know, there are some in the area, but open mics can be kind of hit or miss, right?</p>
<p>Sometimes they're really great.</p>
<p>There's like a lot of people that's a good vibe, or sometimes it's kind of, I don't know, awkward.</p>
<p>Share with us, with the audience, when you have your first one and how it goes.</p>
<p>That is so exciting.</p>
<p>I will.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I'm really happy about that.</p>
<p>All right, let's do a role play.</p>
<p>Let's do it.</p>
<p>So here I'm asking you for coffee shop suggestions in your town.</p>
<p>Maybe I came to visit you in your town.</p>
<p>I have to get a coffee.</p>
<p>So let's see.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p>I saw a place on Google called Preppy Coffee.</p>
<p>Is it any good?</p>
<p>Kind of hit or miss.</p>
<p>I like their cappuccinos, but the atmosphere isn't always great.</p>
<p>Try Love My Coffee down the street.</p>
<p>I don't want you wasting your money on somewhere that's unreliable.</p>
<p>Plus, the internet is always spotty, and I know you need to do work.</p>
<p>Ooh, thanks.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't want to go to a place that's quality is inconsistent.</p>
<p>Yeah, go to a place whose quality is inconsistent.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>That's a little weird.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>That was weird.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Where the quality is inconsistent.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And this is a typical conversation you might have.</p>
<p>Maybe I came to visit you, but I have to work during the day while you're working.</p>
<p>I work remote.</p>
<p>I'm looking for a coffee shop to park in for a while, right?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>All right, so let's go through it, Michelle.</p>
<p>What did I say first?</p>
<p>What did you say?</p>
<p>So I said, you said, is this coffee place any good?</p>
<p>And I said, um, it's kind of hit or miss.</p>
<p>And I just wanted to highlight that because some</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p>And I just wanted to highlight that because sometimes we, yeah, I could say, um, it's hit or miss, but sometimes we say kind of hit or miss, kind of hit or miss, right?</p>
<p>So incredibly natural.</p>
<p>We do this a lot when we, I think the reason we do that is because we're trying to soften the blow for the coffee shop.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And then you said, I don't want you wasting your money on somewhere that's unreliable.</p>
<p>Now, Michelle, that gave me a great idea for another episode.</p>
<p>I don't want you doing something.</p>
<p>I don't want you doing this.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>A lot of context in which we use that.</p>
<p>Guys, hit the follow button to get that episode coming up soon.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Good idea, Lindsay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And then I said, plus, the internet is always spotty.</p>
<p>So something specifically that we use for some sort of connection.</p>
<p>And I know you need to do work.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So inconsistent again, right?</p>
<p>Inconsistent quality.</p>
<p>And then</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p>inconsistent quality.</p>
<p>And then I said, thanks.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't want to go to a place where the quality is inconsistent.</p>
<p>Yes, and that just tops off the conversation.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, this was fun.</p>
<p>And guys, we also want to remind you, don't be hit or miss when you listen to All Ears English.</p>

<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And for a takeaway, I mean, think about times in your life where consistent quality matters.</p>
<p>Maybe if you have your own business or if you provide a service, even if you work for a company, what would people think about your work, right?</p>
<p>This is a good inquiry into ourselves.</p>
<p>Is your quality consistent of what you're delivering on a daily basis?</p>
<p>Good to have that inquiry.</p>
<p>Don't you think?</p>
<p>Yeah, I like that.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>All right, guys.</p>
<p>Well, this was fun.</p>
<p>And Lindsay, have a good day and I'll see you in the next one.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
