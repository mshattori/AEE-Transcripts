<p id="p-17">Hello, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-18">How are you?</p>
<p id="p-19">I'm good, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-20">How are you?</p>
<p id="p-21">Oh my gosh, we're having fun recording together.</p>
<p id="p-22">I know.</p>
<p id="p-23">I'm so excited to be back.</p>
<p id="p-24">And I have a question for you.</p>
<p id="p-25">Okay, let's hear it.</p>
<p id="p-26">Do you use the word right a lot?</p>
<p id="p-27">Yes, I do probably too much.</p>
<p id="p-28">I've actually heard from a couple of our listeners.</p>
<p id="p-29">They're like, you say right a lot.</p>
<p id="p-30">Sort of to confirm</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-31">when sort of to confirm that I agree with what Lindsay says or what someone else says.</p>
<p id="p-32">I'll be like, right?</p>
<p id="p-33">Or at the end of what I say, right?</p>
<p id="p-34">I apologize.</p>
<p id="p-35">I apologize.</p>
<p id="p-36">I think I also use it as a filler.</p>
<p id="p-37">So I'll say right.</p>
<p id="p-38">But when I have listened to episodes, I have heard myself using it a lot.</p>
<p id="p-39">I know.</p>
<p id="p-40">So today we're going to dive into not only do we use it as a filler like that, we use it in so many ways in English.</p>
<p id="p-41">It comes up all the time and there are some very native natural chunks that we're going to teach you today that you should be using with the word right.</p>
<p id="p-42">But be sure to hit follow, guys.</p>
<p id="p-43">We've had so many amazing episodes lately and we have a lot of fun ones planned coming up.</p>
<p id="p-44">So be sure to hit the follow button so they drop right into your queue.</p>
<p id="p-45">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-46">So I'm excited about this episode because it's an excuse for Aubrey and I to use the word right without any guilt.</p>
<p id="p-47">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-48">Right, Right,</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-49">Right, So let's dive in.</p>
<p id="p-50">This first way that we use it is to say, I'll be right and then blank.</p>
<p id="p-51">There are so many ways we say this depending on where we are.</p>
<p id="p-52">So for example, if you're on the first floor of a building and you're on the phone telling someone that you're coming upstairs, you might say, I'll be right up.</p>
<p id="p-53">Or downstairs, going upstairs, I'll be right up.</p>
<p id="p-54">Right, I'll be right up.</p>
<p id="p-55">Or let's say I'm upstairs in my house right now and let's say my kids were calling me, I could say, I'll be right down.</p>
<p id="p-56">Exactly, right?</p>
<p id="p-57">And this is really the most common, natural way that we would say that.</p>
<p id="p-58">Or if I'm at a neighbor's house and my husband asked me to come home for something, I might say, I'll be right over.</p>
<p id="p-59">That's often like if you're in a nearby space at a nearby home or maybe like a coffee shop next to somewhere and you're gonna go to this neighboring store, I'll be right over.</p>
<p id="p-60">Right, it usually involves some</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-61">Right, it usually involves some sort of transportation, whether it's walking or driving.</p>
<p id="p-62">Yes, and we wouldn't say this room to room, right?</p>
<p id="p-63">If I'm in one room next to another room, like at work, would you say I'll be right over?</p>
<p id="p-64">I probably would say I'll be right there.</p>
<p id="p-65">Right, I'll be right there.</p>
<p id="p-66">That's a good one.</p>
<p id="p-67">It's interesting, these little nuances between which one we choose.</p>
<p id="p-68">Right, or I'll be right in, right?</p>
<p id="p-69">So let's say you're outside of a room where somebody is, or let's say you're meeting someone for lunch, you could say I'll be right in.</p>
<p id="p-70">You're out and now you're going to go in.</p>
<p id="p-71">Yes, you're likely to hear this when you go to the doctor and maybe the nurse takes your vitals and they'll say the doctor will be right in.</p>
<p id="p-72">It means they'll be like right in the room with you.</p>
<p id="p-73">They're not in the room now, they'll be right in.</p>
<p id="p-74">Right, right.</p>
<p id="p-75">Or if you're inside a room, inside a house maybe, and maybe your neighbor's out front, oh, I'll be right out.</p>
<p id="p-76">Or like if you're in the bath.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-77">I'll be right out.</p>
<p id="p-78">Or like if you're in the bathroom and your kids are yelling that they want you, I'll be right out.</p>
<p id="p-79">Oh yeah, I probably use this one a lot.</p>
<p id="p-80">I'll be right out.</p>
<p id="p-81">Or we already talked about right there, but I'll be right here means kind of you're actually staying put.</p>
<p id="p-82">You're not actually going anywhere.</p>
<p id="p-83">It's more that you're waiting for someone to come to you.</p>
<p id="p-84">So you'll say, whenever you're ready, I'm not going anywhere.</p>
<p id="p-85">I'll be right here.</p>
<p id="p-86">Right, I use this a lot, right?</p>
<p id="p-87">If someone's like, I'll be there in 10 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-88">No problem.</p>
<p id="p-89">I'll be right here.</p>
<p id="p-90">It's very friendly.</p>
<p id="p-91">Yeah, very friendly.</p>
<p id="p-92">And this one actually brings me to, can I add one?</p>
<p id="p-93">Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-94">I'll be right back.</p>
<p id="p-95">So this one is you go away and then you're saying I'll be right back.</p>
<p id="p-96">Or remember when we were younger, BRB, be right back?</p>
<p id="p-97">Yeah, I still use that, BRB.</p>
<p id="p-98">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-99">BRB.</p>
<p id="p-100">But so with I'll be right back.</p>
<p id="p-101">So my parents...</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-102">I'll be right back.</p>
<p id="p-103">So my parents always joke that when I was two years old, we were on a family vacation and I saw a gift shop.</p>
<p id="p-104">And I'm two and I just stand up and we're outside and I just said, I'll be right back just to go by myself to this gift shop.</p>
<p id="p-105">And now it's funny because my daughter says also, well, it was more not I'll be right back, but it was be right back.</p>
<p id="p-106">Just like, oh, I'm two.</p>
<p id="p-107">I can go by myself.</p>
<p id="p-108">That's fine.</p>
<p id="p-109">So nonchalantly.</p>
<p id="p-110">Yeah, So be right back.</p>
<p id="p-111">It's really funny.</p>
<p id="p-112">And that is maybe of all the phrases we're using today, that's one of the most common.</p>
<p id="p-113">Be right back.</p>
<p id="p-114">Right, If you're at a store with someone and maybe they're checking out.</p>
<p id="p-115">So you go to look at something and you want to tell them that you're going to return to where they are.</p>
<p id="p-116">So what we would always say, I'll be right back.</p>
<p id="p-117">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-118">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-119">So wow, these are all good, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-120">What else do we want to get to?</p>
<p id="p-121">Yeah, so we have a few more.</p>
<p id="p-122">We'll often say right with you.</p>
<p id="p-123">You've likely heard a receptionist say, I'll be right with you.</p>
<p id="p-124">This means they are</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-125">you, this means they are occupied right now.</p>
<p id="p-126">Maybe they're helping someone else.</p>
<p id="p-127">But this is a very polite way that you can say you're sort of apologizing that it's taking a minute.</p>
<p id="p-128">I'll be right with you.</p>
<p id="p-129">Right, I'll be right with you.</p>
<p id="p-130">Or right away.</p>
<p id="p-131">So this is ASAP, as soon as possible, right?</p>
<p id="p-132">So I'll get to that right away.</p>
<p id="p-133">You're not taking any time.</p>
<p id="p-134">You're getting to it.</p>
<p id="p-135">Maybe somebody's waiting and you said, oh, sorry, I'll get to it right away.</p>
<p id="p-136">I'm doing it.</p>
<p id="p-137">Yeah, I'm more likely to say this even than like, you know, very soon or ASAP.</p>
<p id="p-138">This would be more in my dial to be like, yeah, I'll do that right away.</p>
<p id="p-139">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-140">It's definitely a good one.</p>
<p id="p-141">And the last one is right on.</p>
<p id="p-142">This one, yeah, I feel like it was really trendy maybe in the 80s or the 90s.</p>
<p id="p-143">I see it in older movies a ton for someone to say right on.</p>
<p id="p-144">But we still hear it.</p>
<p id="p-145">So what does it mean?</p>
<p id="p-146">So it's just kind of like, that's awesome, right?</p>
<p id="p-147">Yeah, that's great.</p>
<p id="p-148">Awesome.</p>
<p id="p-149">But we usually use it as a response.</p>
<p id="p-150">So</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-151">We usually use it as a response.</p>
<p id="p-152">So let's do a mini roleplay to show how that would look.</p>
<p id="p-153">Okay, so I got the job.</p>
<p id="p-154">Right on, that's awesome.</p>
<p id="p-155">Hey! Yeah, it's just like a way to encourage.</p>
<p id="p-156">This is actually a great connection skill.</p>
<p id="p-157">It's so friendly to, you know, because you're not always going to want to say, congratulations, awesome.</p>
<p id="p-158">You want a lot of ways to say that.</p>
<p id="p-159">And this is a fun one, right on.</p>
<p id="p-160">Yeah, that's a good idea for a follow-up episode, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-161">Maybe we'll do one on different ways to say congratulations.</p>
<p id="p-162">Yes, I love that idea.</p>
<p id="p-163">All right, let's dive into a roleplay here, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-164">You are standing at the counter of a department store, and I am there as a sales associate.</p>
<p id="p-165">I'll start us out.</p>
<p id="p-166">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-167">I'll be right with you.</p>
<p id="p-168">No worries.</p>
<p id="p-169">Sorry about that.</p>
<p id="p-170">How can I help you?</p>
<p id="p-171">I was hoping to look at one of those necklaces.</p>
<p id="p-172">Great.</p>
<p id="p-173">I'll get that right away.</p>
<p id="p-174">I just need to unlock this case.</p>
<p id="p-175">Actually, I need to find my friend downstairs, but then we'll be right back up.</p>
<p id="p-176">No problem.</p>
<p id="p-177">I'll have it right here for you.</p>
<p id="p-178">All right, so we used a...</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-179">All right, so we used a lot of them here.</p>
<p id="p-180">One you didn't notice was right on.</p>
<p id="p-181">Why do you think we didn't have right on in this role play?</p>
<p id="p-182">So maybe it's, this could be a little too informal or casual, right?</p>
<p id="p-183">Because I'm talking to you, it sounds like I'm at a nice store and I'm looking for this necklace.</p>
<p id="p-184">It's a little too casual.</p>
<p id="p-185">It's more for using it with friends.</p>
<p id="p-186">Yeah, I thought about trying to squeeze it into this role play, either to have the sales associate say right on, or maybe the other, I'm like, that feels very strange.</p>
<p id="p-187">It is more informal, right?</p>
<p id="p-188">If someone's trying to be professional, they're speaking to a stranger, a sales associate, they wouldn't, I don't think they would say right on.</p>
<p id="p-189">That would be very rare.</p>
<p id="p-190">Right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-191">Right, right, it would be.</p>
<p id="p-192">So let's go through this.</p>
<p id="p-193">I first said, I'll be right with you.</p>
<p id="p-194">So that's one we shared where, you know, I'm maybe helping someone else putting something away and letting them know as soon as I can, I will come and help you.</p>
<p id="p-195">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-196">And then I asked</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-197">And then I asked you to get me one of the necklaces that's probably in the case.</p>
<p id="p-198">And you said, I'll get that right away.</p>
<p id="p-199">I just need to unlock this case.</p>
<p id="p-200">So I'll get that immediately, ASAP.</p>
<p id="p-201">Exactly, right?</p>
<p id="p-202">It would be strange to say this and then go leave them waiting and go do other things.</p>
<p id="p-203">That means you're going to do it right now.</p>
<p id="p-204">Right, Right, I can't stop saying right now.</p>
<p id="p-205">Right, I would like to actually go back and count how many times we say it in this episode.</p>
<p id="p-206">Oh my gosh, that would be interesting.</p>
<p id="p-207">And you said, oh, I need to run get my friend downstairs and then we'll be right back up.</p>
<p id="p-208">So you're saying you could just say we'll be right back.</p>
<p id="p-209">But you can't say we'll be right back up because you're going downstairs and then back upstairs.</p>
<p id="p-210">Yeah, so it's interesting.</p>
<p id="p-211">We combined the right up and right back and made it right back up.</p>
<p id="p-212">Yeah, And then I said, I'll have it right here for you.</p>
<p id="p-213">So this is, you can say I'll be right here, meaning I'll be here waiting.</p>
<p id="p-214">Or like this, you can say</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-215">or like this, you can say it this way, she'll have the necklace right here for you, meaning like it will be here ready for you.</p>
<p id="p-216">Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-217">So it's not going anywhere basically.</p>
<p id="p-218">We want to make sure you guys didn't miss an episode Lindsay and I recorded.</p>
<p id="p-219">It was 2360 right here on All Ears English, your grammar questions answered, past simple or past progressive.</p>
<p id="p-220">I get a lot of questions for students about this, so I want to make sure you guys don't miss that episode.</p>
<p id="p-221">That is tricky grammar.</p>
<p id="p-222">Oh yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-223">It's really important guys to listen to these episodes so you can get your grammar top notch with Aubrey and Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-224">Absolutely, so let's just give a takeaway here.</p>
<p id="p-225">I feel like a lot of these phrases, though we use right a ton, a lot of them are chunks that are really great connection skills, right?</p>
<p id="p-226">Even just the politeness but sort of the courtesy of telling someone I'll be right back or I'll be with you right away.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-227">Or I'll be with you right away.</p>
<p id="p-228">All of these are things that if you didn't say it, if there was just silence, often it would be sort of rude.</p>
<p id="p-229">These are things that we say in order to be more friendly and polite.</p>
<p id="p-230">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-231">It's almost like those signposts.</p>
<p id="p-232">It's just giving people signals of what's going on so people aren't totally lost.</p>
<p id="p-233">But yeah, try it.</p>
<p id="p-234">I mean, these are, you can use these immediately.</p>
<p id="p-235">So practice adding them to your conversations to connect and, you know, show that courtesy in English.</p>
<p id="p-236">Yeah, and these are not the type, even though we had so many different ones in this role play, it doesn't feel strange and repetitive.</p>
<p id="p-237">They all have very different meanings.</p>
<p id="p-238">The word right comes up all the time and natives don't even notice because it's so common and has so many different uses.</p>
<p id="p-239">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-240">That's a good point, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-241">So don't be afraid to use these.</p>
<p id="p-242">Yes, Awesome, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-243">Thanks for joining me today.</p>
<p id="p-244">This was very fun.</p>
<p id="p-245">Yes, great topic.</p>
<p id="p-246">Thanks, Aubrey, and thanks to everyone for listening.</p>
<p id="p-247">Yeah, see you next time.</p>
<p id="p-248">All right, bye.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-249">Yeah, see you next time.</p>
<p id="p-250">All right, bye.</p>
