<p>Hello, Michelle.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>I'm good, Aubrey.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, we're having fun recording together.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I'm so excited to be back.</p>
<p>And I have a question for you.</p>
<p>Okay, let's hear it.</p>
<p>Do you use the word right a lot?</p>
<p>Yes, I do probably too much.</p>
<p>I've actually heard from a couple of our listeners.</p>
<p>They're like, you say right a lot.</p>
<p>Sort of to confirm</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>when sort of to confirm that I agree with what Lindsay says or what someone else says.</p>
<p>I'll be like, right?</p>
<p>Or at the end of what I say, right?</p>
<p>I apologize.</p>
<p>I apologize.</p>
<p>I think I also use it as a filler.</p>
<p>So I'll say right.</p>
<p>But when I have listened to episodes, I have heard myself using it a lot.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>So today we're going to dive into not only do we use it as a filler like that, we use it in so many ways in English.</p>
<p>It comes up all the time and there are some very native natural chunks that we're going to teach you today that you should be using with the word right.</p>
<p>But be sure to hit follow, guys.</p>
<p>We've had so many amazing episodes lately and we have a lot of fun ones planned coming up.</p>
<p>So be sure to hit the follow button so they drop right into your queue.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So I'm excited about this episode because it's an excuse for Aubrey and I to use the word right without any guilt.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Right, Right,</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>Right, So let's dive in.</p>
<p>This first way that we use it is to say, I'll be right and then blank.</p>
<p>There are so many ways we say this depending on where we are.</p>
<p>So for example, if you're on the first floor of a building and you're on the phone telling someone that you're coming upstairs, you might say, I'll be right up.</p>
<p>Or downstairs, going upstairs, I'll be right up.</p>
<p>Right, I'll be right up.</p>
<p>Or let's say I'm upstairs in my house right now and let's say my kids were calling me, I could say, I'll be right down.</p>
<p>Exactly, right?</p>
<p>And this is really the most common, natural way that we would say that.</p>
<p>Or if I'm at a neighbor's house and my husband asked me to come home for something, I might say, I'll be right over.</p>
<p>That's often like if you're in a nearby space at a nearby home or maybe like a coffee shop next to somewhere and you're gonna go to this neighboring store, I'll be right over.</p>
<p>Right, it usually involves some</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>Right, it usually involves some sort of transportation, whether it's walking or driving.</p>
<p>Yes, and we wouldn't say this room to room, right?</p>
<p>If I'm in one room next to another room, like at work, would you say I'll be right over?</p>
<p>I probably would say I'll be right there.</p>
<p>Right, I'll be right there.</p>
<p>That's a good one.</p>
<p>It's interesting, these little nuances between which one we choose.</p>
<p>Right, or I'll be right in, right?</p>
<p>So let's say you're outside of a room where somebody is, or let's say you're meeting someone for lunch, you could say I'll be right in.</p>
<p>You're out and now you're going to go in.</p>
<p>Yes, you're likely to hear this when you go to the doctor and maybe the nurse takes your vitals and they'll say the doctor will be right in.</p>
<p>It means they'll be like right in the room with you.</p>
<p>They're not in the room now, they'll be right in.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>Or if you're inside a room, inside a house maybe, and maybe your neighbor's out front, oh, I'll be right out.</p>
<p>Or like if you're in the bath.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>I'll be right out.</p>
<p>Or like if you're in the bathroom and your kids are yelling that they want you, I'll be right out.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I probably use this one a lot.</p>
<p>I'll be right out.</p>
<p>Or we already talked about right there, but I'll be right here means kind of you're actually staying put.</p>
<p>You're not actually going anywhere.</p>
<p>It's more that you're waiting for someone to come to you.</p>
<p>So you'll say, whenever you're ready, I'm not going anywhere.</p>
<p>I'll be right here.</p>
<p>Right, I use this a lot, right?</p>
<p>If someone's like, I'll be there in 10 minutes.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>I'll be right here.</p>
<p>It's very friendly.</p>
<p>Yeah, very friendly.</p>
<p>And this one actually brings me to, can I add one?</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>I'll be right back.</p>
<p>So this one is you go away and then you're saying I'll be right back.</p>
<p>Or remember when we were younger, BRB, be right back?</p>
<p>Yeah, I still use that, BRB.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>BRB.</p>
<p>But so with I'll be right back.</p>
<p>So my parents...</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>I'll be right back.</p>
<p>So my parents always joke that when I was two years old, we were on a family vacation and I saw a gift shop.</p>
<p>And I'm two and I just stand up and we're outside and I just said, I'll be right back just to go by myself to this gift shop.</p>
<p>And now it's funny because my daughter says also, well, it was more not I'll be right back, but it was be right back.</p>
<p>Just like, oh, I'm two.</p>
<p>I can go by myself.</p>
<p>That's fine.</p>
<p>So nonchalantly.</p>
<p>Yeah, So be right back.</p>
<p>It's really funny.</p>
<p>And that is maybe of all the phrases we're using today, that's one of the most common.</p>
<p>Be right back.</p>
<p>Right, If you're at a store with someone and maybe they're checking out.</p>
<p>So you go to look at something and you want to tell them that you're going to return to where they are.</p>
<p>So what we would always say, I'll be right back.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So wow, these are all good, Aubrey.</p>
<p>What else do we want to get to?</p>
<p>Yeah, so we have a few more.</p>
<p>We'll often say right with you.</p>
<p>You've likely heard a receptionist say, I'll be right with you.</p>
<p>This means they are</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>you, this means they are occupied right now.</p>
<p>Maybe they're helping someone else.</p>
<p>But this is a very polite way that you can say you're sort of apologizing that it's taking a minute.</p>
<p>I'll be right with you.</p>
<p>Right, I'll be right with you.</p>
<p>Or right away.</p>
<p>So this is ASAP, as soon as possible, right?</p>
<p>So I'll get to that right away.</p>
<p>You're not taking any time.</p>
<p>You're getting to it.</p>
<p>Maybe somebody's waiting and you said, oh, sorry, I'll get to it right away.</p>
<p>I'm doing it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm more likely to say this even than like, you know, very soon or ASAP.</p>
<p>This would be more in my dial to be like, yeah, I'll do that right away.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It's definitely a good one.</p>
<p>And the last one is right on.</p>
<p>This one, yeah, I feel like it was really trendy maybe in the 80s or the 90s.</p>
<p>I see it in older movies a ton for someone to say right on.</p>
<p>But we still hear it.</p>
<p>So what does it mean?</p>
<p>So it's just kind of like, that's awesome, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, that's great.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>But we usually use it as a response.</p>
<p>So</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>We usually use it as a response.</p>
<p>So let's do a mini roleplay to show how that would look.</p>
<p>Okay, so I got the job.</p>
<p>Right on, that's awesome.</p>
<p>Hey! Yeah, it's just like a way to encourage.</p>
<p>This is actually a great connection skill.</p>
<p>It's so friendly to, you know, because you're not always going to want to say, congratulations, awesome.</p>
<p>You want a lot of ways to say that.</p>
<p>And this is a fun one, right on.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's a good idea for a follow-up episode, Aubrey.</p>
<p>Maybe we'll do one on different ways to say congratulations.</p>
<p>Yes, I love that idea.</p>
<p>All right, let's dive into a roleplay here, Michelle.</p>
<p>You are standing at the counter of a department store, and I am there as a sales associate.</p>
<p>I'll start us out.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I'll be right with you.</p>
<p>No worries.</p>
<p>Sorry about that.</p>
<p>How can I help you?</p>
<p>I was hoping to look at one of those necklaces.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>I'll get that right away.</p>
<p>I just need to unlock this case.</p>
<p>Actually, I need to find my friend downstairs, but then we'll be right back up.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>I'll have it right here for you.</p>
<p>All right, so we used a...</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>All right, so we used a lot of them here.</p>
<p>One you didn't notice was right on.</p>
<p>Why do you think we didn't have right on in this role play?</p>
<p>So maybe it's, this could be a little too informal or casual, right?</p>
<p>Because I'm talking to you, it sounds like I'm at a nice store and I'm looking for this necklace.</p>
<p>It's a little too casual.</p>
<p>It's more for using it with friends.</p>
<p>Yeah, I thought about trying to squeeze it into this role play, either to have the sales associate say right on, or maybe the other, I'm like, that feels very strange.</p>
<p>It is more informal, right?</p>
<p>If someone's trying to be professional, they're speaking to a stranger, a sales associate, they wouldn't, I don't think they would say right on.</p>
<p>That would be very rare.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>Right, right, it would be.</p>
<p>So let's go through this.</p>
<p>I first said, I'll be right with you.</p>
<p>So that's one we shared where, you know, I'm maybe helping someone else putting something away and letting them know as soon as I can, I will come and help you.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And then I asked</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>And then I asked you to get me one of the necklaces that's probably in the case.</p>
<p>And you said, I'll get that right away.</p>
<p>I just need to unlock this case.</p>
<p>So I'll get that immediately, ASAP.</p>
<p>Exactly, right?</p>
<p>It would be strange to say this and then go leave them waiting and go do other things.</p>
<p>That means you're going to do it right now.</p>
<p>Right, Right, I can't stop saying right now.</p>
<p>Right, I would like to actually go back and count how many times we say it in this episode.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, that would be interesting.</p>
<p>And you said, oh, I need to run get my friend downstairs and then we'll be right back up.</p>
<p>So you're saying you could just say we'll be right back.</p>
<p>But you can't say we'll be right back up because you're going downstairs and then back upstairs.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it's interesting.</p>
<p>We combined the right up and right back and made it right back up.</p>
<p>Yeah, And then I said, I'll have it right here for you.</p>
<p>So this is, you can say I'll be right here, meaning I'll be here waiting.</p>
<p>Or like this, you can say</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>or like this, you can say it this way, she'll have the necklace right here for you, meaning like it will be here ready for you.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>So it's not going anywhere basically.</p>
<p>We want to make sure you guys didn't miss an episode Lindsay and I recorded.</p>
<p>It was 2360 right here on All Ears English, your grammar questions answered, past simple or past progressive.</p>
<p>I get a lot of questions for students about this, so I want to make sure you guys don't miss that episode.</p>
<p>That is tricky grammar.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>It's really important guys to listen to these episodes so you can get your grammar top notch with Aubrey and Lindsay.</p>
<p>Absolutely, so let's just give a takeaway here.</p>
<p>I feel like a lot of these phrases, though we use right a ton, a lot of them are chunks that are really great connection skills, right?</p>
<p>Even just the politeness but sort of the courtesy of telling someone I'll be right back or I'll be with you right away.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>Or I'll be with you right away.</p>
<p>All of these are things that if you didn't say it, if there was just silence, often it would be sort of rude.</p>
<p>These are things that we say in order to be more friendly and polite.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It's almost like those signposts.</p>
<p>It's just giving people signals of what's going on so people aren't totally lost.</p>
<p>But yeah, try it.</p>
<p>I mean, these are, you can use these immediately.</p>
<p>So practice adding them to your conversations to connect and, you know, show that courtesy in English.</p>
<p>Yeah, and these are not the type, even though we had so many different ones in this role play, it doesn't feel strange and repetitive.</p>
<p>They all have very different meanings.</p>
<p>The word right comes up all the time and natives don't even notice because it's so common and has so many different uses.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>That's a good point, Aubrey.</p>
<p>So don't be afraid to use these.</p>
<p>Yes, Awesome, Michelle.</p>
<p>Thanks for joining me today.</p>
<p>This was very fun.</p>
<p>Yes, great topic.</p>
<p>Thanks, Aubrey, and thanks to everyone for listening.</p>
<p>Yeah, see you next time.</p>
<p>All right, bye.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>Yeah, see you next time.</p>
