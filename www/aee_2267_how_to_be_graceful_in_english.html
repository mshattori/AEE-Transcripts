<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p>In today's episode, a listener asks us about the word Grace.</p>
<p>Not only is the name popular right now, but we see the word all over the English language.</p>
<p>Find out how to use it in many different ways today.</p>
<p>Hey, Michelle, what's shaken? Not too much, Lindsay.</p>
<p>How are you? Great.</p>
<p>Do you have a question for me to start off today? Sure.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you have any friends named Grace? I don't have any close friends named Grace, but I do know people, I know a few people named Grace.</p>
<p>It is a popular name.</p>
<p>Uh What about you, Michelle? Any friends named Grace? I don't have any friends named Grace, but I have heard people naming their kids, Grace or Gracie is a nickname which is very cute.</p>
<p>Um I think of the show Will and Grace.</p>
<p>Did you watch that? Of course, that was such a good show.</p>
<p>Great show.</p>
<p>That show won, I think it won awards or just became like a real cultural phenomenon, you know?</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>Cultural phenomenon.</p>
<p>You know, the word Grace is definitely in the English language.</p>
<p>It's in media, it is everywhere.</p>
<p>So we were excited Michelle when we got a question from a listener from Angel Bermejo, she says, hi Michelle and Lindsay, he or she, I love you both.</p>
<p>I hope you can share different uses of the word Grace.</p>
<p>Good one.</p>
<p>Michelle, good one.</p>
<p>Definitely, definitely.</p>
<p>Um And we have talked about this really great expression before.</p>
<p>Um What was that expression? Yeah.</p>
<p>Give yourself some grace.</p>
<p>And in that episode, episode 2052 we really got into the idea of allowing yourself some leeway.</p>
<p>And I think that's going to be a word we're going to get into today.</p>
<p>Right, But allowing yourself just being patient with yourself a little bit.</p>
<p>Right, Right, Right, Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>And sometimes I think with language learning, we</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>Learning.</p>
<p>Um We need to give ourselves some grace and that goes for our listeners too.</p>
<p>Right, Lindsay, because I think sometimes people might listen to the podcast and they hear it pretty, pretty fast.</p>
<p>We don't adjust our language, we don't adjust our speed, right? That's the one thing that's different about us compared to other podcasts.</p>
<p>And I think ultimately, our listeners love it, but a lot of other podcasts that teach English will slow down, they will give you kind of a teacher talk English, but we don't do that at all because we get bored, we would get hi.</p>
<p>Uh And so we want to enjoy our conversations too.</p>
<p>And so what you can do though is a way to give yourself grace.</p>
<p>We have just released an update to our I Os Android Apple.</p>
<p>We have come up with a way that you guys can give yourself some grace and actually slow down the episodes to very specific speeds.</p>
<p>Like what Michelle like what for example, like 0.8 X and 0.9 X guys that is really going to</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>That is really going to help you if you want to listen a little bit slower because you still get everything.</p>
<p>You still get our intonation and you know, it just might be just that little bit that you need to catch everything we say and that's fine.</p>
<p>Give yourself some grace.</p>
<p>You don't have to feel that you need to listen to it.</p>
<p>Exactly the way it's published, really give yourself some grace.</p>
<p>You got it, you got it.</p>
<p>That's a perfect use of that expression.</p>
<p>And you know, listeners have asked us for this.</p>
<p>You guys have been asking us for this and we don't think as far as we know, we can't do this on Spotify or Apple.</p>
<p>So it's a very unique feature if you consume Allers English over in our app and not that, but there are a few other very cool things available for premium users, right? Michelle, what are they, what do we get out there? The app is incredible.</p>
<p>There's really a lot over there.</p>
<p>Um One thing you get is real time human made transcripts, right? Because we've seen</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>Right, because we've seen, we've seen transcripts that are not human made and they're not, they're not there yet.</p>
<p>Right? Because here we have, you're gonna get our natural utterances, the little things that aren't going to be picked up by the robots.</p>
<p>You got it, you got it.</p>
<p>You also get tapp keywords.</p>
<p>So we have selected seven keywords in every episode that we believe will move your fluency level higher.</p>
<p>So you can tap on those, you can see the definition, you can save them to your personal power list.</p>
<p>Right? Michelle, all of this stuff comes over only over on the app, right? You can't get it anywhere else.</p>
<p>So where should they go to get the app guys head on over to all ears English dot com slash apps A PPP.</p>
<p>It's a good time to start, you know, learning with the app.</p>
<p>It is we're into the fall now and it's a good time to set new habits.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So that was our example of grace.</p>
<p>Getting into the concept of grace.</p>
<p>Right, Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>Give ourselves some grace.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>Exactly give ourselves some grace.</p>
<p>So now let's talk about some other ways that you can use this word and other words that are going to be helpful in this idea.</p>
<p>Um So Grace.</p>
<p>So Cambridge, first of all, there are a lot of definitions we have Cambridge dictionary mentioned elegance when I looked it up, this idea of being classy.</p>
<p>So you can use grace as a noun or graceful as an adjective, but it could also just be a nice personality trait.</p>
<p>So that's interesting.</p>
<p>So let's give some examples.</p>
<p>So number one is the ballerina made a very graceful entrance.</p>
<p>So what does that mean? Lindsay? It's always nice to see dancers or ballerina the way they move very graceful light and every move of the arm or the leg is very intentional.</p>
<p>Um It's kind of the opposite of clumsy or intentional.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>Intentional.</p>
<p>It's just a beautiful way of moving physically.</p>
<p>It's smooth, it's kind of flowing.</p>
<p>Um It's not choppy so it's really beautiful.</p>
<p>But if we use it like this, so her grace and compassion is what made her so beloved in the community.</p>
<p>So here we're not, are we talking about how she moves here? We're not going, we're going away from the physical piece, we're going to the personality, right? So when you talk about Grace as a kind of personality trait, it becomes imagine the translation of that smooth and respectful way of moving into a person's character, right? Something, something I don't know why on my Instagram, I keep on getting different, you know, things popping up about.</p>
<p>Um Oh my gosh, why can't they think of this word? You know, like uh</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>You know, like uh how to, how to do things in a graceful way.</p>
<p>You're, oh my gosh, why can't I like where people go to school sometimes to, like, learn about how to manners, like finishing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Manners.</p>
<p>But ok, well, manners is fine.</p>
<p>Manners of the word I can.</p>
<p>I'm having one of those moments but I keep on getting things about that and, and one popped up the other day and it was about how to put your purse and look in your purse in a graceful way.</p>
<p>And this is something that I am not.</p>
<p>I am not good.</p>
<p>Well, it's interesting, right? Because over the generations in the decades, I feel like probably, you know, in the early 19 hundreds or in the 1800 the Victorian era women had to learn these things.</p>
<p>Right? You got that you went to school and you learn, you were taught and you had to be physically, at least physically graceful, if not character wise.</p>
<p>But that's.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>Character wise, but that's, you know, women are busy and at work and it's not necessarily a priority for families to teach us etiquette is the word good etiquette, but there still is something really nice when you see someone that has that etiquette knows exactly what to do in every social scenario, physically and socially.</p>
<p>Um It's kind of amazing mesmerizing in a way.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>Um So I wanted to teach this, this is not the word grace, but I think Lindsay, you said this word as well.</p>
<p>It's really good here.</p>
<p>So the word is leeway.</p>
<p>Um Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What, what does leeway mean? Yeah, giving, kind of giving extra time or also giving extra space in a way.</p>
<p>So, um you just heard this recently at a doctor's appointment, I guess, right? For example, they give you a 15.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>Right, for example, they give you a 15 minute grace period, but then they cancel your appointment.</p>
<p>So, right.</p>
<p>So this is a meaning of grace.</p>
<p>A grace period means leeway.</p>
<p>So sorry, I got that a little bit jumbled here, but a a grace period is this idea of having some leeway.</p>
<p>So yes, what happened was um I had to go to a doctor's appointment.</p>
<p>The only time they had was right at the second, I drop my daughter off at camp that.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I looked it up and it said 10 minutes away and I explained the situation and they said exactly this, they give you a 15 minute grace period, but then they cancel your appointment.</p>
<p>And I was, I was that was the day that we were recording Lindsay and I had to push back.</p>
<p>Remember because I didn't want to give up the I didn't want to give up the appointment.</p>
<p>So it's this idea of leeway, right.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>The idea of leeway, right? Like you get some, you get some extra grace, you get a grace period, some extra time.</p>
<p>And I think you can find the meaning in this too.</p>
<p>The concept of having grace, giving grace, having a grace period is like a light touch, kind of forgiving someone or going through the world with sort of a light touch that it allows you that light touch room to breathe.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And then there's the term good graces, this is good, right? To be in someone's good graces means someone has a positive opinion of you, right? So give us a sample sentence, Michelle.</p>
<p>OK? I think it's OK that you made the mistake.</p>
<p>You're usually in her good graces.</p>
<p>So I wouldn't worry about it.</p>
<p>I mean, everyone, usually you build up goodwill and then you know, over time and then if you make a mistake, you're not going all of a sudden, most people are still going to give you that, give you that give you grace.</p>
<p>Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Love that.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Love that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>And then Michelle, we also see this in religion or in prayer.</p>
<p>Right, Right, So, whether you are religious or not, just a good word to know is something before a meal.</p>
<p>Sometimes certain religions may say something that they call grace.</p>
<p>Right, A little prayer before the meal.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You might be more likely to see this in the movies.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I haven't been to a lot of homes where this has been done, like, but you might show up at someone's home and they might say let's take a minute to say grace.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Um, so just don't be surprised if you hear it, but more likely you'd see that in a movie.</p>
<p>Yeah, you do see it on a lot of, in a lot of movies.</p>
<p>Um, so, um, but there are even more ways it is used but these are the ones we're going to focus on Lindsay.</p>
<p>Are there any of these that you feel you use the most? Hm.</p>
<p>Let me see.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I think Grace, period.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>I think grace period.</p>
<p>I've also say that, yeah, you know, like, for example, if you li if some kind of, I'm not talking about your driver's license, I don't think there's a grace period for that if you have some kind of license to operate something and it expires.</p>
<p>Like, do you have to stop operating the next day? And maybe it depends on the industry, that sort of thing has come up recently in my life.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I think grace period is really common.</p>
<p>You see it around policies around, you know, working policies out in the world for sure, even for something as simple as going to a restaurant.</p>
<p>So, you know, a couple of weeks ago I went somewhere and they, I didn't know exactly when our table would be ready.</p>
<p>So we just said we'll put our name down, they take your phone number and then they were very strict about it and they said once we contact you, you there's a 10 minute grace period, right? So this idea of, I think making appointments wherever it is right there.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's the most</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>Yeah, that's the most.</p>
<p>I think that's when you're going to see it the most for sure.</p>
<p>And yeah, that so yeah, reservations when you're waiting for your name to be called or appointments, that's where we're going to see it the most in our daily lives for sure.</p>
<p>So Michelle, should we go into a role play? Let's do it.</p>
<p>So, here we are.</p>
<p>Well, last role play we were sisters and now we're cousins.</p>
<p>All right, good.</p>
<p>So here we are at a family reunion.</p>
<p>Oh, do you do a lot of family reunions, Michelle? No, not with my side of the family.</p>
<p>Really.</p>
<p>But um with Dan's side they, I mean, actually it was like 10 years ago.</p>
<p>So I think there would be a while ago, but it was a formal actual family reunion.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, let's get started.</p>
<p>So, here we go.</p>
<p>This place is so great.</p>
<p>Can you believe how cute little Nelly is? She's adorable and she's so graceful the way she speaks.</p>
<p>I love her.</p>
<p>I'll say</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>She speaks.</p>
<p>I love her.</p>
<p>I same here.</p>
<p>She's definitely in my good graces as far as little kids go.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, no, we're late to say grace.</p>
<p>It's ok.</p>
<p>They have a five minute grace period at the restaurant so we can start a bit later.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>I don't think we're gonna say grace this many times.</p>
<p>Put it, put it in.</p>
<p>I got, I figured it out.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So let's go through it.</p>
<p>So I said she's adorable and she's so graceful.</p>
<p>So maybe this little girl is four years old or something.</p>
<p>She's very sweet and she just has, you know, she has a good disposition.</p>
<p>Right, Yeah.</p>
<p>Maybe she's respectful of other kids.</p>
<p>She's aware of her physical space.</p>
<p>It could mean any of those things.</p>
<p>Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>She's not like walking through knocking things over and that sounds like my voice.</p>
<p>Right, That, that's the way I still am now.</p>
<p>It's me too.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>Now it's me too.</p>
<p>Um, and then same here.</p>
<p>She's definitely in my good graces as far as little kids go.</p>
<p>So, what am I saying there? You're saying you like her? Right? She's, you have a favorable opinion of her.</p>
<p>Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And then you said Michelle? Oh, no, we're late to say grace.</p>
<p>So, I guess we're a little bit of a religious family.</p>
<p>Right, Right, And so I wonder if you're saying, like, we're late to sit down to dinner.</p>
<p>That is what you're actually saying that.</p>
<p>Right, Right, And then I said, ah, it, ok, they have a five minute grace period at the restaurant.</p>
<p>So, maybe our name got called and we didn't we? Yeah.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>So, lots of things here.</p>
<p>Um, but of course you probably aren't going to say grace that many times.</p>
<p>Um, so, but this is good.</p>
<p>I mean, this is such a good question, guys.</p>
<p>We want to remind you before we go that it's really great.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p>That.</p>
<p>It's really great.</p>
<p>Give yourself some grace, get our app all ESL dot com slash app A P P.</p>
<p>Um Give yourself some grace, slow us down a little bit, slow it down.</p>
<p>Pay attention, you know, you have that opportunity.</p>
<p>We haven't seen that ability anywhere else, those very granular speeds.</p>
<p>So check it out on the app and then broadly as the takeaway about Grace, I think that name is trending, as we said at the top of the show, Michelle, that name is trending and when something starts to trend, you may hear it in other places in the language and the culture, right? And so that's interesting to think about it.</p>
<p>As you hear more people naming their kid Grace, you'll see the use of the word grace and the meanings around it.</p>
<p>So it's a very timely episode today.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, this has been a fun one.</p>
<p>Thank you to our listener for that question.</p>
