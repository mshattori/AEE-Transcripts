<p id="p-19">Hello, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-20">How are you today?</p>
<p id="p-21">Good, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-22">How are you?</p>
<p id="p-23">I'm fantastic.</p>
<p id="p-24">No complaints.</p>
<p id="p-25">No complaints.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-26">I'm fantastic, no complaints, no complaints.</p>
<p id="p-27">What are we getting into today?</p>
<p id="p-28">Well, I have a question.</p>
<p id="p-29">Lindsay, are you addicted to coffee?</p>
<p id="p-30">Michelle, I have to say I pretty much am.</p>
<p id="p-31">I think chemically I am slightly addicted, but actually I was surprised.</p>
<p id="p-32">I went to decaf and I experienced some headaches like the first day and then I was good.</p>
<p id="p-33">So I think chemically I'm not, but I think in terms of ritual, I am.</p>
<p id="p-34">What about you?</p>
<p id="p-35">Tell me your take on coffee.</p>
<p id="p-36">Yeah, I definitely am.</p>
<p id="p-37">Wait, so you only drink decaf now?</p>
<p id="p-38">No, now I'm kind of in a weird place.</p>
<p id="p-39">I'm mixing it in.</p>
<p id="p-40">I'm doing like half-calf and I'm mixing the beans, the normal beans and the decaf beans.</p>
<p id="p-41">I'm mixing it all in.</p>
<p id="p-42">Sounds like you have a whole lab over there.</p>
<p id="p-43">Yeah, I just don't know.</p>
<p id="p-44">I don't know what I'm doing.</p>
<p id="p-45">Well, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-46">Well, for me, I have a cup in the morning and then I used to be like, okay, that's it, the one cup and I'm done.</p>
<p id="p-47">But now I always have with lunch.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-48">Now I always have with lunch or sometime in the afternoon.</p>
<p id="p-49">And that is, I think it definitely did become more of a ritual.</p>
<p id="p-50">I mean, I'm sure also my body needs the caffeine at this point, but it's also, I know what you mean about just that feeling of, oh, I like to have a cup of coffee with my lunch.</p>
<p id="p-51">And I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-52">It's routine, right?</p>
<p id="p-53">It is.</p>
<p id="p-54">I don't know why.</p>
<p id="p-55">So but recently we did an episode actually on the Business English podcast.</p>
<p id="p-56">That was episode 394.</p>
<p id="p-57">And that was what's your daily routine morning edition.</p>
<p id="p-58">And it was part two of a series.</p>
<p id="p-59">The first part was on All Ears English.</p>
<p id="p-60">It was about the evening, I believe.</p>
<p id="p-61">So but we were talking about coffee.</p>
<p id="p-62">And Lindsay, you mentioned that we should do an episode about bonding or connecting with someone over your coffee habits, which is such a fun idea.</p>
<p id="p-63">So that's where the idea for this episode came from.</p>
<p id="p-64">So thank you.</p>
<p id="p-65">We're going to get into it today.</p>
<p id="p-66">This is really fun.</p>
<p id="p-67">I mean, this this is such a huge conversation.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-68">This is such a huge conversation topic, a great way to connect with someone.</p>
<p id="p-69">What do you think, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-70">A hundred percent, a hundred percent.</p>
<p id="p-71">And for our listeners who may not be coffee drinkers, you can just insert whatever thing you like to drink on a regular basis into here, right?</p>
<p id="p-72">Because you can also have conversations about your tea drinking habits.</p>
<p id="p-73">I think coffee drinkers are particularly, I don't know, into their coffee or into how their coffee integrates with their day, but tea drinkers are too, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-74">So this is the basis of an amazing connection moment for our listeners.</p>
<p id="p-75">That's right.</p>
<p id="p-76">Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-77">So this is going to be huge.</p>
<p id="p-78">So guys, make sure that you stay tuned because towards the end, we are going to give you a Spotify poll that you can do on Spotify.</p>
<p id="p-79">Guys, we've been doing these polls.</p>
<p id="p-80">If you're listening on Spotify, you can see polls and we do a poll with every episode, but these special ones we announce on the show and then we announce the results.</p>
<p id="p-81">So listen up to see what that poll will be so that you can answer.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-82">that Paul will be so that you can interact with us and we can hear your opinions.</p>
<p id="p-83">Yes, amazing.</p>
<p id="p-84">And Michelle, can I take just a minute here to say thank you to our listeners who left a review in Apple Podcasts and Spotify.</p>
<p id="p-85">So I want to say a huge thank you to Catherine, who left us a five-star review and said it's definitely our show is definitely one of her favorites.</p>
<p id="p-86">A special thank you to Polly in the US on March 21st, also a five-star review, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-87">Wow.</p>
<p id="p-88">I know.</p>
<p id="p-89">And SZY101791 from China, as well as StacyLee111 and Vihang Kare from India, as well as Last0010.</p>
<p id="p-90">Michelle, these are all five-star reviews, but either way, no matter how you review our show, we appreciate reading your review, right, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-91">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-92">Yeah, Lindsay sent a bunch over yesterday and it was so exciting to see.</p>
<p id="p-93">So thank you really</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-94">It's so exciting to see.</p>
<p id="p-95">So thank you, really.</p>
<p id="p-96">We truly look at them.</p>
<p id="p-97">So thank you very much.</p>
<p id="p-98">So all right, let's get into it.</p>
<p id="p-99">Let's talk about some things you can say.</p>
<p id="p-100">This is kind of a, we're just really throwing things out here because it's such a huge topic.</p>
<p id="p-101">So Lindsay, what's one question you can ask, one conversation topic that comes up a lot?</p>
<p id="p-102">We'll go with the basics here, right?</p>
<p id="p-103">So how many cups of coffee do you drink a day, right?</p>
<p id="p-104">And how would you answer that, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-105">You could say, I drink about two cups a day, right?</p>
<p id="p-106">Yes, Yeah, So yeah, that's kind of how Lindsay, that's kind of how we started out, right?</p>
<p id="p-107">And then it just ends up leading into so many different things.</p>
<p id="p-108">And honestly, I think usually when we're asking this question, we're trying to get a sense of if we're normal, right?</p>
<p id="p-109">I drink four.</p>
<p id="p-110">How many do you drink?</p>
<p id="p-111">Right, Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-112">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-113">So okay.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-114">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-115">So, okay, here's another one.</p>
<p id="p-116">Do you make your coffee at home or do you get it out?</p>
<p id="p-117">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-118">And so this really is, and it's so interesting because this is one of the things that becomes a routine in our day and we usually have a go-to mode.</p>
<p id="p-119">We usually don't do, most people do love routine and they either make it at home every day or they get it out.</p>
<p id="p-120">I personally do both.</p>
<p id="p-121">Yeah, Like most people who like to make it at home like to let me save money, but I buy the beans at home and then I go and buy one in the afternoon out.</p>
<p id="p-122">So it's not saving any money at all.</p>
<p id="p-123">That's funny.</p>
<p id="p-124">Yeah, I mean, my morning coffee is always at home.</p>
<p id="p-125">Actually, I was thinking I should, just this morning actually, I was in such a rush with my kids.</p>
<p id="p-126">Normally I drink it before we go, but I didn't have time.</p>
<p id="p-127">So I brought it in the car and it wasn't that hot and I thought, okay, this is fine.</p>
<p id="p-128">But then I started to drink it.</p>
<p id="p-129">Sorry for the story, it's gross.</p>
<p id="p-130">But no, I started to drink it and you know when you drink something</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-131">to drink it.</p>
<p id="p-132">And you know, when you drink something and it goes down like the wrong pipe, basically.</p>
<p id="p-133">And I was like, and then I like ended up spitting like all this coffee.</p>
<p id="p-134">Oh, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-135">I'm sorry.</p>
<p id="p-136">This is all today.</p>
<p id="p-137">All ready today.</p>
<p id="p-138">This was today.</p>
<p id="p-139">So then I was thinking because I knew we were doing this episode and I thought, oh gosh, if I'm so addicted that I couldn't even go, you know, I had to, I had to have it in the morning.</p>
<p id="p-140">I couldn't, I was coming home then to record with you.</p>
<p id="p-141">I could have had it.</p>
<p id="p-142">My gosh.</p>
<p id="p-143">Anyway, so.</p>
<p id="p-144">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-145">We all have our own, you know, our own challenges with our morning coffee.</p>
<p id="p-146">But you're right.</p>
<p id="p-147">If I don't, if for some reason I can't get my coffee, like let's say for example, I've forgotten to buy the beans on the weekend and then I wake up, I will be really annoyed.</p>
<p id="p-148">Yeah, No, it's true.</p>
<p id="p-149">And then one time I was going over to a friend's house and I know that she doesn't drink coffee and it was time for my afternoon coffee and I felt bad asking if she had coffee.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-150">asking if she had coffee because I don't think that she does.</p>
<p id="p-151">So then the next time I was going over to another friend's house and before, now every time I text my friend like, oh, like do you have coffee?</p>
<p id="p-152">Or if not, I'm going to stop and get a coffee.</p>
<p id="p-153">It becomes a real thing, a whole thing.</p>
<p id="p-154">And another way that we like to talk about our drinking coffee is how we like to take our coffee.</p>
<p id="p-155">Often we say, you know, how do you take your coffee?</p>
<p id="p-156">You might hear that in a more formal restaurant though, right?</p>
<p id="p-157">How do you take your coffee?</p>
<p id="p-158">Or if you're at a party and someone is actually serving you coffee.</p>
<p id="p-159">But we also talk about this with friends.</p>
<p id="p-160">Personally, I like my coffee black.</p>
<p id="p-161">I take my coffee black.</p>
<p id="p-162">Michelle, how do you like your coffee?</p>
<p id="p-163">Do you like your coffee strong with sugar or with cream, milk?</p>
<p id="p-164">I like my coffee with half and half.</p>
<p id="p-165">And usually just that.</p>
<p id="p-166">But if I'm out, I will put</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-167">out.</p>
<p id="p-168">I will put some sort of little flavor perhaps in it.</p>
<p id="p-169">And then I mean, just like a sugar-free vanilla or something, and then I like to have like cinnamon on top.</p>
<p id="p-170">Oh, very nice, very nice.</p>
<p id="p-171">It's kind of funny because as you travel, right, you see that in different countries, coffee is taken differently, right?</p>
<p id="p-172">Here in the US, it's a lot of just personal choices.</p>
<p id="p-173">When I go to France, when I go to Paris, it's often cafe au lait, right?</p>
<p id="p-174">I guess you can get a cappuccino and you can get an espresso, but cafe au lait, I think I have a feeling it's kind of rare in France and our listeners should speak up and correct me if I'm wrong to actually have black coffee.</p>
<p id="p-175">I guess that would just be a shot of espresso, right?</p>
<p id="p-176">But it's not the same thing.</p>
<p id="p-177">Drip coffee is not espresso.</p>
<p id="p-178">I like to get an Americano too or a decaf Americano, but it's not the same thing, black coffee and espresso.</p>
<p id="p-179">Yeah, I don't often get an espresso.</p>
<p id="p-180">I mean, I like</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-181">I like espressos, but Dan gets those a lot.</p>
<p id="p-182">But I mostly just want a regular cup of coffee.</p>
<p id="p-183">Yeah, yeah, me too.</p>
<p id="p-184">This is hold it in your hands and drink it.</p>
<p id="p-185">Enjoy the ritual again.</p>
<p id="p-186">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-187">What else would we say, Michelle, to someone?</p>
<p id="p-188">Well, yeah, so you could say, how do you drink your coffee?</p>
<p id="p-189">What does that mean, how do you drink your coffee?</p>
<p id="p-190">I don't think I've heard that.</p>
<p id="p-191">You don't think you've heard?</p>
<p id="p-192">I mean, it's basically the same thing as how do you take your coffee.</p>
<p id="p-193">Oh, okay.</p>
<p id="p-194">For me, I don't really hear how do you take your coffee as much.</p>
<p id="p-195">Oh, interesting.</p>
<p id="p-196">Yeah, Maybe it's like a northern New England thing.</p>
<p id="p-197">I grew up in northern New England.</p>
<p id="p-198">Yeah, I think maybe it's a little old-fashioned.</p>
<p id="p-199">How do you take your coffee?</p>
<p id="p-200">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-201">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-202">But yeah, I would more likely say, how do you drink your coffee?</p>
<p id="p-203">Oh, Michelle, we don't really find regional differences between us very often.</p>
<p id="p-204">Aubrey and I find them all the time because she grew up in the West.</p>
<p id="p-205">But you and I, this is one of the first.</p>
<p id="p-206">Very interesting.</p>
<p id="p-207">Yes, Okay, this is a...</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-208">Yes, Okay.</p>
<p id="p-209">This is a fun episode.</p>
<p id="p-210">Michelle, is there any, where do we go from here?</p>
<p id="p-211">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-212">Well, now we're just going to have some fun.</p>
<p id="p-213">So I'm going to joke that you might hear.</p>
<p id="p-214">Well, you drink your coffee black, but my dad drinks his, whoo, he could pour all the cream.</p>
<p id="p-215">And sometimes you might hear something like, do you want some coffee with your cream?</p>
<p id="p-216">Have you ever heard that?</p>
<p id="p-217">Oh yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-218">We make this joke with a lot of things, right?</p>
<p id="p-219">What would be something else?</p>
<p id="p-220">I don't know if you have like chocolate syrup in your ice cream, you could say, do you want some ice cream with your chocolate syrup?</p>
<p id="p-221">Ketchup maybe if somebody puts a lot of ketchup on their French fries, something like that.</p>
<p id="p-222">Yes, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-223">Yeah, I feel like often you'll see in a movie or in real life, someone with the sugar, you know, you go to like a diner and you have the big sugar thing in a glass, the tall sugar, it looks like eight ounces of sugar.</p>
<p id="p-224">People just pouring forever and like having a conversation and pouring.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-225">ever, and like having a conversation and pouring and pouring and pouring until it takes up half the glass.</p>
<p id="p-226">No wonder we have so much diabetes in this country.</p>
<p id="p-227">It's like, wow.</p>
<p id="p-228">Yeah, there's a lot of that.</p>
<p id="p-229">Yeah, So, but yeah, so you might hear the joke, do you want some coffee with your cream?</p>
<p id="p-230">So it's just saying you're putting so much cream, oh, that the coffee is secondary at that point.</p>
<p id="p-231">So yeah, that's a little joke that you might hear.</p>
<p id="p-232">And then another one is drinking your coffee black, like Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-233">And then a lot of times somebody will say something, or you might even see it on a mug or something like, don't talk to me until I've had my coffee in the morning, right?</p>
<p id="p-234">Oh yeah, you see a lot of T-shirts.</p>
<p id="p-235">I had a tank top that said something about coffee.</p>
<p id="p-236">I can't remember what it said now, but there's lots of little sayings you can get if you go to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.</p>
<p id="p-237">Yeah, you can make sure that your values towards coffee are known when you enter your house if you want to, right?</p>
<p id="p-238">Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-239">And then there's also</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-240">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-241">And then there's also coffee snob or coffee connoisseur.</p>
<p id="p-242">Lindsay, are you a coffee snob?</p>
<p id="p-243">No, I'm really not.</p>
<p id="p-244">I mean, I don't like the cheapest brands like Folgers or the really basic stuff, but I'm not a snob.</p>
<p id="p-245">I don't need pour over.</p>
<p id="p-246">I don't need the fanciest, most expensive coffee.</p>
<p id="p-247">I mean, you know, I just like dark roast rather than light roast.</p>
<p id="p-248">I don't like the light roast, even though I think they say it's better for you.</p>
<p id="p-249">It has more antioxidants because the dark roast is kind of burnt out from what I understand, I guess.</p>
<p id="p-250">But I care about how dark or light it is for sure.</p>
<p id="p-251">So does that make me a coffee snob?</p>
<p id="p-252">I don't know, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-253">What about you?</p>
<p id="p-254">I'm not a coffee snob.</p>
<p id="p-255">I just I don't want it to taste like water.</p>
<p id="p-256">But other than that, I'm pretty I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-257">Every once in a while, I normally don't taste the I don't know, I guess my taste isn't very sophisticated.</p>
<p id="p-258">But every once in a while, I do try</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-259">I do try a different type of coffee and I can recognize, oh, this is better than what I usually have.</p>
<p id="p-260">But yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-261">For sure.</p>
<p id="p-262">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-263">But I wouldn't say I'm a coffee snob.</p>
<p id="p-264">I think we have a couple more minutes.</p>
<p id="p-265">I just want to do a quick debate with you.</p>
<p id="p-266">I have some questions here.</p>
<p id="p-267">Okay, let's do it.</p>
<p id="p-268">All right.</p>
<p id="p-269">Well, we've already kind of talked about this one.</p>
<p id="p-270">And these guys are topics that will come up in conversation.</p>
<p id="p-271">So caffeine or no caffeine, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-272">Oh, Michelle, half-calf right now.</p>
<p id="p-273">Half-calf.</p>
<p id="p-274">Half-calf.</p>
<p id="p-275">Only caffeine over here.</p>
<p id="p-276">All right.</p>
<p id="p-277">You know what happened?</p>
<p id="p-278">I cut out caffeine and I realized my sleep got worse.</p>
<p id="p-279">So I'm going back to caffeine.</p>
<p id="p-280">Yeah, I thought I was going to sleep better cutting out caffeine, going to decaf and my sleep actually got worse.</p>
<p id="p-281">Oh, no.</p>
<p id="p-282">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-283">How did that happen?</p>
<p id="p-284">All the research is debunked right here.</p>
<p id="p-285">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-286">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-287">A big science experiment.</p>
<p id="p-288">All right, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-289">Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts.</p>
<p id="p-290">Hot takes.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-291">Hot takes, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-292">How do I answer this?</p>
<p id="p-293">I'm okay with both.</p>
<p id="p-294">I'm okay with both.</p>
<p id="p-295">What I love about Dunkin' is that it feels incredibly Boston.</p>
<p id="p-296">Every time I fly into Logan Airport, there's a Dunkin' right there, and I hear the accents, and I think I'm home, right?</p>
<p id="p-297">And I love that.</p>
<p id="p-298">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-299">I don't have an issue.</p>
<p id="p-300">This could be another great connection moment for our listeners.</p>
<p id="p-301">Starbucks has made a lot of new rules lately.</p>
<p id="p-302">They're changing their business model.</p>
<p id="p-303">They're eliminating food.</p>
<p id="p-304">There's a lot to be talked about.</p>
<p id="p-305">They're not eliminating it, but they're reducing some food.</p>
<p id="p-306">Sorry.</p>
<p id="p-307">They're taking out some kinds of foods.</p>
<p id="p-308">They're changing the bathroom rules.</p>
<p id="p-309">Guys, there's a lot you could get into if you do a little research on recent changes in Starbucks' business model.</p>
<p id="p-310">You could debate with people.</p>
<p id="p-311">You could see what they think about the changes happening.</p>
<p id="p-312">There's a lot there.</p>
<p id="p-313">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-314">I happen to like Starbucks more than Dunkin's coffee.</p>
<p id="p-315">I do notice that.</p>
<p id="p-316">But yeah, there's a whole...</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-317">But yeah, there's a whole, you know, sometimes you talk to somebody and you say Starbucks and you're almost embarrassed to say it because they're... Yeah, sure.</p>
<p id="p-318">Yeah, so interesting.</p>
<p id="p-319">All right, I think we should move on to a role play.</p>
<p id="p-320">I think we should too, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-321">Yeah, I think if we got into Starbucks, we could go on and on.</p>
<p id="p-322">I have a lot of things to say there, but let's get into a role play to show our listeners the key vocab.</p>
<p id="p-323">So here we're waiting in line at a coffee shop and we don't know each other.</p>
<p id="p-324">A great opportunity to meet someone new, right?</p>
<p id="p-325">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-326">All right, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-327">Have you tried the coffee at this place yet?</p>
<p id="p-328">It's amazing.</p>
<p id="p-329">And trust me, I am a coffee snob.</p>
<p id="p-330">Oh, me too.</p>
<p id="p-331">It's okay.</p>
<p id="p-332">How many cups of coffee do you drink a day?</p>
<p id="p-333">Well, if I'd say I drink about four or five cups a day, you?</p>
<p id="p-334">Maybe three or four, but everyone knows.</p>
<p id="p-335">Don't talk to me until I've had my coffee in the morning.</p>
<p id="p-336">Oh, me too.</p>
<p id="p-337">How do you drink your coffee?</p>
<p id="p-338">Two creamers, one sugar, and always hot, even in the summer.</p>
<p id="p-339">Whoa, I can't do that.</p>
<p id="p-340">It's iced coffee for me.</p>
<p id="p-341">And no Starbucks.</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p id="p-342">And no Starbucks ever.</p>
<p id="p-343">Oh, totally agree.</p>
<p id="p-344">I like it from mom and pop shops.</p>
<p id="p-345">The best and always with caffeine.</p>
<p id="p-346">Yes, Why would you bother otherwise?</p>
<p id="p-347">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-348">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-349">Yeah, So again, people make themselves known.</p>
<p id="p-350">This is another one of those topics where you can make yourself known, you and your values through what you say about your coffee habits, right?</p>
<p id="p-351">This is why we love this topic.</p>
<p id="p-352">So a couple of the vocab, Michelle, that we used here, I said, trust me, I am a coffee snob, right?</p>
<p id="p-353">Snob.</p>
<p id="p-354">Snob.</p>
<p id="p-355">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-356">And then I said, how many cups of coffee do you drink a day?</p>
<p id="p-357">So that's a good question.</p>
<p id="p-358">And I said that I drink about four or five cups a day.</p>
<p id="p-359">And I asked you, usually you would turn that back and ask the other person in that moment.</p>
<p id="p-360">Yes, And then I said, but everyone knows, don't talk to me until I've had my coffee in the morning.</p>
<p id="p-361">Yeah, Yeah, And you're not saying that to me right now, right?</p>
<p id="p-362">Because of course we're talking and we're waiting in line for your coffee.</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p id="p-363">And we're waiting in line for your coffee.</p>
<p id="p-364">But you know, it's a saying.</p>
<p id="p-365">You're exaggerating a bit.</p>
<p id="p-366">And that's how you are in the morning.</p>
<p id="p-367">You know, people know to stay away.</p>
<p id="p-368">And I said, oh, me too.</p>
<p id="p-369">And how do you drink your coffee?</p>
<p id="p-370">So, Lindsay, this one sounds, so you would say, how do you take your coffee?</p>
<p id="p-371">I guess it may, obviously it makes sense, right?</p>
<p id="p-372">How do you drink your coffee?</p>
<p id="p-373">But yeah, I absolutely grew up hearing, how do you take your coffee?</p>
<p id="p-374">How do you take your coffee?</p>
<p id="p-375">No, I've heard it too, but definitely, well, it's funny because guys, this question actually could be confusing.</p>
<p id="p-376">How do you drink your coffee?</p>
<p id="p-377">I mean, what, like, I don't know, out of a cup?</p>
<p id="p-378">I know, I bring the cup to my lips and I push it back.</p>
<p id="p-379">But when you hear this, generally people would be saying, like, what do you put, do you put anything in it?</p>
<p id="p-380">Do you like it?</p>
<p id="p-381">That's really what this question means.</p>
<p id="p-382">Yeah, and I actually, what I like better than both of these is how do you like your coffee?</p>
<p id="p-383">How do you like your coffee?</p>
<p id="p-384">How do you like your coffee?</p>
<p id="p-385">Or you could say, how do you like to take your coffee?</p>
<p id="p-386">Oh no, we're</p>
<h2>Part-21</h2>
<p id="p-387">How do you like to take your coffee?</p>
<p id="p-388">Oh, no, we're making it more complex now.</p>
<p id="p-389">How do you drink your coffee or how do you like your coffee?</p>
<p id="p-390">Perfect.</p>
<p id="p-391">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-392">And then I told you and I said, I like it always hot.</p>
<p id="p-393">That's another thing people like to talk about, right?</p>
<p id="p-394">Some people, they drink hot coffee all year round.</p>
<p id="p-395">It could be 99 degrees outside.</p>
<p id="p-396">No, I switch over to ice.</p>
<p id="p-397">Although my morning coffee is always hot.</p>
<p id="p-398">What about you?</p>
<p id="p-399">Yeah, me too.</p>
<p id="p-400">I feel exactly the same way.</p>
<p id="p-401">Something about the morning, I've got to have hot coffee.</p>
<p id="p-402">But in the summer, I'll do iced in the afternoon.</p>
<p id="p-403">On a warm day in the winter, maybe that kind of thing.</p>
<p id="p-404">Yeah, Right, All right.</p>
<p id="p-405">Is it always hot even in the summer?</p>
<p id="p-406">And I said, well, I can't do that.</p>
<p id="p-407">It's iced coffee for me.</p>
<p id="p-408">And that's an interesting way to say what I have is iced coffee.</p>
<p id="p-409">It's iced coffee for me.</p>
<p id="p-410">It's iced coffee for me.</p>
<p id="p-411">Maybe we'll do another episode about that.</p>
<p id="p-412">That's a pretty common construction.</p>
<p id="p-413">It's iced coffee for me, right?</p>
<p id="p-414">Yes, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-415">Michelle, this has been so good.</p>
<h2>Part-22</h2>
<p id="p-416">Michelle, this has been so good.</p>
<p id="p-417">And before we do our takeaway, we do have a poll for our listeners.</p>
<p id="p-418">Yes, So guys, on Spotify, you can find this poll now.</p>
<p id="p-419">The question is just coffee or tea?</p>
<p id="p-420">So we want to know what do our listeners like to drink?</p>
<p id="p-421">This will actually be a really interesting poll to report back because I know tea is huge, huge around the globe, right?</p>
<p id="p-422">But I know coffee is big too.</p>
<p id="p-423">So I'm rooting for coffee.</p>
<p id="p-424">I hope coffee wins.</p>
<p id="p-425">I have a feeling it's not going to win.</p>
<p id="p-426">Really?</p>
<p id="p-427">I think it will.</p>
<p id="p-428">Yeah, All right.</p>
<p id="p-429">We're going to report back on the results, guys.</p>
<p id="p-430">So make sure you're listening over in Spotify.</p>
<p id="p-431">Michelle, where should we leave our listeners?</p>
<p id="p-432">This was a long episode I just saw, but that's because this is such a good conversation topic.</p>
<p id="p-433">There's so much to say.</p>
<p id="p-434">You can talk really for a very long time to somebody about coffee.</p>
<p id="p-435">And, you know, just give it a try.</p>
<p id="p-436">This is a great way to connect with someone.</p>
<p id="p-437">And that's what we're all about.</p>
<p id="p-438">Yeah, we're always looking for ways we can</p>
<h2>Part-23</h2>
<p id="p-439">Yeah, we're always looking for ways we can learn more about the person and share more about ourselves than the topic at hand, right?</p>
<p id="p-440">This is about so much more than coffee.</p>
<p id="p-441">This is about lifestyle.</p>
<p id="p-442">This is about choices.</p>
<p id="p-443">This is maybe about budget even, right?</p>
<p id="p-444">How much money are you willing to pay for coffee?</p>
<p id="p-445">We can learn so much about people.</p>
<p id="p-446">It really is endless.</p>
<p id="p-447">So yeah, give it a try and definitely take our poll.</p>
<p id="p-448">We're excited to see the results.</p>
<p id="p-449">All right, Michelle, I'll see you on the next episode.</p>
<p id="p-450">Take care.</p>
<p id="p-451">Bye.</p>
<p id="p-452">You too.</p>
