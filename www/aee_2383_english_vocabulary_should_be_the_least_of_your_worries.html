<p>But in your answer,</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>But in your answer, you also said something interesting at the very end, Aubrey.</p>
<p>What did you say?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>At least I said, at least, you know, I said we're getting recording done at least.</p>
<p>And I could have put it before that and said, at least we're getting recording done.</p>
<p>This is an interesting chunk that we use so much.</p>
<p>I'm excited to dive into this today.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, yeah.</p>
<p>It's tacked on in the end, in the beginning, maybe in the middle.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>We're going to explore it today.</p>
<p>Right, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yeah, and stay to the end because this is inspired by a recent episode where Lindsay said this.</p>
<p>And so we will share at the end that episode so you can go check it out if you missed it.</p>
<p>The cool thing about All Ears English is because we have, you know, we have the transcripts available in the app and available at allearsenglish.com slash subscribe, Aubrey, you go through the transcripts every week and you're able to identify native and natural phrases we use kind of in passing on the show.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>These are human created transcripts, which is rare anymore with AI doing so many of them.</p>
<p>We have human</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>Doing so many of them.</p>
<p>We have human created transcripts.</p>
<p>We want them to be as accurate as possible for you.</p>
<p>I go through those and I'm pulling keywords, the most important vocabulary for you to add to your power list in the app.</p>
<p>And then I also notice a lot of interesting chunks and language features that we're able to highlight on later episodes.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's actually really cool.</p>
<p>So we're able to examine what we say on the show and then create new episodes for you based on what we say naturally.</p>
<p>Okay, so good stuff guys.</p>
<p>Hit the follow button if you love the show.</p>
<p>Let's start with at least, just at least alone, Aubrey.</p>
<p>Tell us about this.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it's an adverb phrase.</p>
<p>It means the minimum that is true or possible.</p>
<p>We use it at the end, the beginning, the middle.</p>
<p>Let's share a few examples here.</p>
<p>Okay, I know you wanted her to call, but she texted at least.</p>
<p>My tone of voice is a little different too, isn't it?</p>
<p>True, the intonation is important.</p>
<p>We're giving, what's the word?</p>
<p>We are acknowledging that at least, you know, she did the very minimum.</p>
<p>She may not have done</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>She did the very minimum.</p>
<p>She may not have done what you expected, but she did this at least.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And so your tone goes up in a positive way, right?</p>
<p>It feels lighter.</p>
<p>We're glass half full people here.</p>
<p>We're trying to look at the positive when we say at least.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>What about Mediterranean cruise?</p>
<p>I might say, I won't be able to do the Mediterranean cruise I wanted, but at least we're going on a trip to the mountains.</p>
<p>So some cruise has fallen through.</p>
<p>We're replacing it with maybe a trip that's not quite as exciting, but I'm trying to look at the bright side, be positive.</p>
<p>At least we're doing this trip.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that makes me think of culture.</p>
<p>I mean, I would be fascinated to know from our listeners if you have a function in your language like at least where you end a lot of statements on the bright side.</p>
<p>I don't know if we can assume it's global, this way of speaking necessarily, Aubrey.</p>
<p>I think American culture, we're a young culture compared to a lot of ancient cultures.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>to a lot of ancient cultures.</p>
<p>And I think we have more of a vibe towards like presenting a positive message sometimes.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And this comes up a lot in our culture, in movies and TV.</p>
<p>There's a film, Pollyanna, where she's always positive, always looking at the bright side.</p>
<p>This came up in one of our interviews as part of one of our courses.</p>
<p>It's a big part of our culture.</p>
<p>Yeah, so maybe we can formulate a survey question at the end of the episode for this to learn more from our listeners about their cultures.</p>
<p>So look out for that.</p>
<p>All right, here's the next one.</p>
<p>At least you called your mom on her birthday.</p>
<p>I totally forgot.</p>
<p>Yeah, so here we're seeing it at the beginning, right?</p>
<p>At least you called your mom on her birthday.</p>
<p>I totally forgot to call mine.</p>
<p>So the important thing is it can show up at the end, it can show up at the beginning, or presenting a positive side of something.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Such a native chunk.</p>
<p>And we use least or at least in so many ways in English.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>least in so many ways in English.</p>
<p>We're going to share a few of these other chunks.</p>
<p>So for example, in the least or the least bit, these both mean not even a little bit.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love that.</p>
<p>So first example here, I'm not upset about, sorry, I'm not upset about that in the least.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you're emphasizing here, right?</p>
<p>You could say, I am not upset about that at all, or I am not upset even a little bit, but we use this chunk.</p>
<p>I'm not upset about that in the least.</p>
<p>Love that.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>What else, Aubrey?</p>
<p>What's another one?</p>
<p>And then this, the least bit has the same meaning.</p>
<p>So we might say, he apologized but didn't seem the least bit sincere.</p>
<p>And again, to emphasize, he didn't even seem a little bit sincere.</p>
<p>Yeah, really interesting.</p>
<p>And then we move on to another way this comes out is at the very least.</p>
<p>I feel like I use this a lot.</p>
<p>Do you use this?</p>
<p>Yeah, it means the minimum that is expected.</p>
<p>So for example,</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>So, for example, at the very least, you could have called to let me know you'd be late.</p>
<p>You're letting someone know you didn't even do the bare minimum.</p>
<p>Didn't do the bare minimum.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>Didn't meet expectations in any way.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So, for example, I thought he'd text back at the very least.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>At the very least.</p>
<p>I feel like this does come up a lot in dating.</p>
<p>It's like we have certain expectations.</p>
<p>Maybe you would love a date, a phone call.</p>
<p>I was like, I thought at least he'd text back.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I thought he'd text back at the very least.</p>
<p>Or if you've had a horrible date and it's like a personal hygiene issue, I thought he'd brush his hair at the very least.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Or change his shirt at the very least.</p>
<p>I thought he'd wear shoes at the very least.</p>
<p>We could tell some horror stories.</p>
<p>I'm sure we all have them.</p>
<p>So that's fun.</p>
<p>That's a way to connect for our listeners, telling dating horror stories.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And this is such a great way to exaggerate a little or really emphasize.</p>
<p>They didn't even meet the barest minimum of expectations.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>The barest minimum of expectations.</p>
<p>Now, one question, Aubrey, for this very least, I find myself putting emphasis on very.</p>
<p>At the very least, I thought he'd brush his hair.</p>
<p>Is that what you do too?</p>
<p>Yes, same.</p>
<p>At the very least, you could have called to let me know you'd be late.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>We hit very a little bit harder.</p>
<p>You do not want to use these in a monotone because you are creating emphasis, so it would be very strange to have a flat tone.</p>
<p>You want to slow down enough that you can emphasize that word more.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>All right, and there is a fourth.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is the least of one's worries.</p>
<p>So this chunk means something that seems unimportant compared to greater concerns.</p>
<p>Okay, so for example, I should be worried about my health, but it's the least of my worries.</p>
<p>Yeah, I've said this recently because I'm dealing with so much with kids and all these things, and then I'll realize at the end of the day that I have not drunk any water.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>I'm like, I should be concerned about my hydration, but it's the least of my worries.</p>
<p>I have so many other things to think about.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>I have so many other things to think about.</p>
<p>Wow, so challenging to be a mom, right?</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, or sleep I would imagine.</p>
<p>Sleep as well is one of those things.</p>
<p>That too, right?</p>
<p>It's the least of my worries.</p>
<p>It should be a huge concern.</p>
<p>It's debilitating to be tired all the time, but so many other things to worry about.</p>
<p>All right, next one.</p>
<p>We have another example here.</p>
<p>Aubrey, what's that one?</p>
<p>Yeah, we're just glad you're okay.</p>
<p>Fixing the car is the least of our worries.</p>
<p>So we said this to our daughter when she wrecked her car.</p>
<p>It was a terrible accident, but luckily she was okay.</p>
<p>And this was where like, we're just happy that you are not injured.</p>
<p>Fixing the car is the least of our worries, even though it was totaled and was actually a huge pain.</p>
<p>That compared to the other concern that she could have been injured worse.</p>
<p>Perfect time to use this phrase.</p>
<p>No, that's perfect.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>These are great examples.</p>
<p>初めての世界がすぐそこに。アメリカン航空とJALのパートナーシップがあなたの旅を。</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>パートナーシップがあなたの旅にもっと自由と快適さをお届けします。日本からロサンゼルス、ニューヨーク、ダラス、シカゴなどアメリカ主要都市へ直行便。さらに中南米各地へもスムーズにアクセス。つながり、翼、広がる空の旅。アメリカン航空とジェットで世界がもっと近くなる。OK、アブリ、ロールプレイに入ってみましょう。私たちのリスナーはこれらのフレーズが生きているのを見たいと知っています。絶対に。私はリンジーに誰かにゴーストされたことを共有しています。これが最近だったら、私はこのロールプレイの中で30年前のことを話しているかもしれません。そうそう、それは大丈夫です。ここに行きましょう。私が始めます。彼は少なくとも私が興味がないことを知らせるために電話をかけたかもしれません。とても失礼です。彼はあなたの感情について最も心配していないようです。正確に。少なくとも、彼はテキストを送ることができました。ごめんなさい。とても残念です。</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>I'm sorry, such a bummer.</p>
<p>I'm better off without him.</p>
<p>I won't miss him in the least.</p>
<p>Besides, with everything going on at work, dating is the least of my worries.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's always a challenge.</p>
<p>I mean, I don't feel like I have these conversations much anymore because most of my friends are married with kids at this point.</p>
<p>But, you know, in the day, if you were partnered up and happy and your friend was getting ghosted and still in the thick of things with the dating world, which is supposed to be really challenging these days, what to say when this happened?</p>
<p>Because you find yourself using cliches and then rolling your eyes at what you're saying.</p>
<p>Totally, exactly.</p>
<p>And we recently did an episode with trendy dating vocabulary, ghosting, breadcrumbing.</p>
<p>If you missed that, scroll up.</p>
<p>You got to check it out.</p>
<p>It was amazing.</p>
<p>Yeah, really challenging to know what to say.</p>
<p>So let's see what we did say, though, vocabulary wise.</p>
<p>So you started by saying he could have called to let me know he's not interested at least.</p>
<p>Right, So this is where I just never heard from someone again.</p>
<p>Right, They ghosted me.</p>
<p>And I'm</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>ghosted me.</p>
<p>And I'm saying like, I would have loved a call to say, you know, I'm sorry, we're not the match.</p>
<p>That's the bare minimum of my expectation there.</p>
<p>So I say he could have called at least.</p>
<p>Yeah, And then I said, oh, so rude.</p>
<p>He doesn't seem the least bit concerned about your feelings.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, And this just means not even a little bit.</p>
<p>He doesn't seem even a little bit concerned about your feelings.</p>
<p>Love that.</p>
<p>And then Aubrey, what'd you say after that?</p>
<p>I said exactly at the very least, he could have sent a text.</p>
<p>So this phrase I'm saying like, this would have been under minimum expectations, but at least he could have sent a text.</p>
<p>Yeah, And he was just not interested.</p>
<p>Yeah, I said, I'm sorry, such a bummer.</p>
<p>And then you kept going on.</p>
<p>You said, I'm better off without him.</p>
<p>I won't miss him in the least.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yeah, Again, this phrase means like not even a little.</p>
<p>I won't miss him even a little bit.</p>
<p>And this is probably, I mean, if I care that he ghosted me, it's probably not true.</p>
<p>This is me convincing myself that I don't care.</p>
<p>It's fine.</p>
<p>We do all kinds of things.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>We do all kinds of things, right?</p>
<p>When this sort of thing happens.</p>
<p>And then you said, besides, with everything going on at work, dating is the least of my worries.</p>
<p>So you're trying to end in a positive tone.</p>
<p>You might still be really hurt, but these are things we can say to at least end in a positive.</p>
<p>And sometimes when we speak in a positive way, the mind follows that, right?</p>
<p>Absolutely, right?</p>
<p>It keeps us in a positive mindset.</p>
<p>This is definitely something I would say, right?</p>
<p>If something goes badly, then say like, well, that's the least of my worries.</p>
<p>I'm going to focus on things that are more important that I should be more concerned with.</p>
<p>And I think in terms of the dating world, that's exactly right.</p>
<p>With this kind of like, oh, you went out once, you got ghosted.</p>
<p>It's really, it's annoying, but it's not something that you need to process for too, too long.</p>
<p>If it's a long relationship, then probably there's more to work through, right?</p>
<p>And I love that you're doing the good friend thing to be like, he doesn't seem the least bit concerned when really you're probably thinking like, he probably just didn't want that awkward conversation.</p>
<p>It's easier to just never reach out again because a lot of people find that</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>because a lot of people find that very awkward to say to someone or even text, I'm sorry we're not the match.</p>
<p>But that's the kind thing to do.</p>
<p>Yeah, we just had this conversation with someone recently, and it's becoming more and more common for sure.</p>
<p>And we've talked about on the show too.</p>
<p>So interesting.</p>
<p>Aubrey, is there another episode we can go to?</p>
<p>Yeah, we want to make sure you don't miss the episode that inspired this.</p>
<p>Lindsay said, that's what our listeners have told us at least in episode 2373, Grammar Answers to a Well-Written Question.</p>
<p>This was about compound adjectives.</p>
<p>When should you hyphenate them?</p>
<p>And we want to make sure you didn't miss that.</p>
<p>So scroll up and check it out.</p>
<p>All right, good stuff.</p>
<p>How should we finish today?</p>
<p>What should we leave our listeners with?</p>
<p>Yeah, a great way to connect is to share the bare minimum that was expected or received.</p>
<p>It's a great way to emphasize disappointment, but like you said, also put a positive spin on things.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think also reflect on your own culture.</p>
<p>Are there a lot of ways in your language to put a positive spin?</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p>Language to put a positive spin on what you're saying or do you feel like that's not as valued in your culture?</p>
<p>Maybe that will be our, like I said, our poll question for today.</p>
<p>And also if you are not in Spotify, you could always come over to YouTube and tell us in the comments of this episode.</p>
<p>Right, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is so interesting because in your culture, it might be that it is seen as almost dishonest to put this positive spin.</p>
<p>It's a very cultural.</p>
<p>So we would be interested in that.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>All right, Aubrey, we are finished up for today.</p>
<p>I'll see you very soon.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>See you next time.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
