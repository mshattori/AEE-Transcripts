<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>How much work or how much time would you say goes into an episode of All Ears English, do you think?</p>
<p>Well, that's a good question, Michelle.</p>
<p>I mean, we have to consider the planning, and then we do the recording, we do the preparation, we do the editing after.</p>
<p>Our wonderful editor, Gaspar, does the editing.</p>
<p>Shout out to Gaspar.</p>
<p>Yes, Thank you.</p>
<p>Shout out to Jandy.</p>
<p>Thank you, Jandy.</p>
<p>Oh, we love our team members here.</p>
<p>So I'd say a fair amount of work goes into it, Michelle.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, There's a lot, I would say.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So let's answer a listener question about All Ears English and what goes into making this podcast.</p>
<p>Yes, So this is from Sophia.</p>
<p>Lindsay, would you read the email for us?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Here's a question from Sophia.</p>
<p>So, hi, All Ears English.</p>
<p>I'm Sophia.</p>
<p>I just wanted to say how much I love your podcast.</p>
<p>It's the first thing I listen to every morning, and it always makes learning English fun.</p>
<p>I'm so impressed with how smooth and clear the podcasts are.</p>
<p>Oh, thank you, Sophia.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>That's a wonderful compliment.</p>
<p>We love those messages.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>Compliment we love those messages from our listeners.</p>
<p>Don't we Michelle?</p>
<p>Oh, we love it.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I Was wondering if you'd be willing to share a bit about how you create the podcast Like how you choose topics prepare and record.</p>
<p>I'd love a peek behind the scenes of my favorite podcast Thanks so much, and I'm looking forward to hearing from you best Sofia.</p>
<p>Wonderful question.</p>
<p>Yeah Thank you so much.</p>
<p>That is a great great question And we are so excited to talk about it here today and teach you guys How to connect with others over their jobs Huge connection topic, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, I would say over their jobs or over any process that they do Yeah, you know it might be their hobby.</p>
<p>Maybe you have a friend that's into playing classical piano What goes into preparing for a classical piano concert, right?</p>
<p>There's so many ways this question could apply So today we're gonna get a vocabulary for that skill of asking about a process Preparation or producing something a work of art, right?</p>
<p>How do we know that?</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>Right, How do we know that and you're gonna learn a little bit about the back the you know, the scenes behind the scene Scenes, that's right.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think we did episode 300 we did behind the scenes of all ears English.</p>
<p>So Wow, I think it's time for an update Maybe the scenes have changed to a little bit.</p>
<p>Who knows right?</p>
<p>We'll see.</p>
<p>Yeah, see Yes, and before we get into it Lindsay, we wanted to give a big thank you to our reviewers.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Yes 100% today I want to call out some reviewers for our Android app So the Android app is another place where you can consume all ears English for free the full podcast But you can go deeper and become a premium listener if you want, but today I want to call out for rest a From I'm not sure where first is from but thank you to for rest a a five-star review Thank you to jh jh see another five-star review MD show Hirana five-star review and thank you to Eddie's and Isaac also an</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>Listen, Isaac, also an amazing review.</p>
<p>Michelle, we love when our listeners take the time to go and review the show.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Thank you guys so much.</p>
<p>We're so appreciative.</p>
<p>We do this for you.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So go over and leave a review, whether you listen in Apple, Spotify, or the app, leave a review for the podcast.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Good stuff.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So let's get into it.</p>
<p>So first, we're going to talk a little bit about the process for All Ears English, and then we're going to get into teaching you guys how to connect with somebody about their own process.</p>
<p>Yes, Okay.</p>
<p>So, Lindsay, how do we choose topics?</p>
<p>What are some ways?</p>
<p>Well, the main way is it comes down to listener questions.</p>
<p>That's why we're always asking you guys to send us listener questions into supportatallearsenglish.com.</p>
<p>We have a humongous document of questions, and obviously, we choose the best questions.</p>
<p>So the more specific your question is, the better, but that's the best way.</p>
<p>That is the main way that we choose content.</p>
<p>Other ways we do it is we also listen in.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>Other ways we do it is we also listen in to our live events that we do with our students, Open Conversation Club, Fluency Party.</p>
<p>What are some themes that we're hearing in terms of things we could work on as a group, as a community?</p>
<p>We look in our community pages where we connect on the internet over there just for our students.</p>
<p>That's another place we find ideas.</p>
<p>Definitely, yeah, right.</p>
<p>But I think our favorite episodes are the ones where we get listener questions because it's just directly what you guys want.</p>
<p>Yes, But we also get ideas from our real lives.</p>
<p>So these are also fun because we recognize that we can hear something and then say, wait a second, this is important.</p>
<p>So sometimes it's important.</p>
<p>It might be something that couldn't be a listener question because it's something that you observed about somebody else.</p>
<p>So for example, Lindsey and I, we just did an episode about the difference between A and N and one, and this came.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>and won, and this came from Lindsay's interaction with somebody who was making this mistake.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah, I was seeing this mistake over and over for a year in every email I got from this person, and I said, nope, we have to address this on the podcast and solve this problem, right?</p>
<p>So I think that's a great way.</p>
<p>So Michelle, you and I have antennae out when we're out in the world and we pay attention.</p>
<p>All the time.</p>
<p>We observe language, right?</p>
<p>We observe language.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, because it's people, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, and then, I mean, on my end, definitely, I will, I mean, even just the other day, I was with a friend and she said two things, and then I said, wait a second, I need to stop and write this down.</p>
<p>And I made a note in my email, I said, thank you, you just gave me two ideas for all these English episodes.</p>
<p>So because, you know, it's kind of working the other way.</p>
<p>So one way is that you guys do the observing, and then one way is that we do the observing.</p>
<p>And so if we know something is gonna be specifically really useful for you, we'll say, ah, this is good.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>you will say, Ah, this is good.</p>
<p>Yes, Another thing we do is sometimes if there's articles we read or information we see, so we might get inspiration from New York Times, HuffPo, right?</p>
<p>It could be something like that, and find ways to make it our own and teach you something from that.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>Or cultural topics come up, we want to address holidays around the world, as sometimes we get ideas from one episode, and that naturally leads into another one.</p>
<p>So, but the main way is from you all, from our listeners.</p>
<p>So, you know, the takeaway here is just send us your questions.</p>
<p>Yes, I'm always so happy.</p>
<p>I'm always so happy when we go, yeah, so guys, yeah, there is a big document.</p>
<p>So when I go in to plan some episodes, I'll first open that document, because first, I want to get to you.</p>
<p>And when I see and again, we could do a whole episode about how to ask a good question.</p>
<p>Hey, there's an idea.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>And so, guys, basically, you know, as specific as you can be.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>So as specific as you can be, that's what it comes down to, but we could always talk about that more another day.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>All right, Michelle.</p>
<p>And then once we have our winning question of the day, what do we do after that?</p>
<p>Yeah, then we have to prepare.</p>
<p>So sometimes it's one that comes pretty naturally, pretty easily to plan.</p>
<p>But sometimes if it's a real grammar question or a very specific vocabulary that we have to think about, what is the difference?</p>
<p>Because sometimes to native speakers, I'm sure you guys realize this with your own language, your own first language, is it can be somebody might ask us a question.</p>
<p>We know there's a difference, but we have to think, wait, what is this?</p>
<p>It doesn't come naturally.</p>
<p>As a native speaker, it's something we may have never thought about before.</p>
<p>And so we might need to do a little research.</p>
<p>100%. And we try to add a role play to most episodes because we've heard from you all.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>because we've heard from you all that you love that.</p>
<p>You love those role plays.</p>
<p>It's a really nice way to summarize the key words that we've learned in that episode and to move into our final thoughts for the episode.</p>
<p>We make sure everything's there.</p>
<p>And then of course, all there's English is edutainment.</p>
<p>We consider this edutainment, so we need to make sure it is edutaining.</p>
<p>Michelle, what is that?</p>
<p>That is a combination of two words.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Okay, so edutainment is education and entertainment, right?</p>
<p>So we wouldn't wanna come on here and just say, okay, we're going to talk about the differences, right?</p>
<p>We're not gonna make it, the whole purpose of the podcast is to make you want to learn, to make you excited about it and to make it fun for you.</p>
<p>Otherwise, what are we doing, right?</p>
<p>So we wanna make sure that it's edutainment.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of the edutainment piece is spontaneous.</p>
<p>You know, a lot of the times when we break out in laughter or we tease each other or we come up with a side point, those aren't planned, all right?</p>
<p>So a good portion.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>planned all right so a good portion of these episodes are unplanned there's a lot of spontaneity in here partly because we have fun doing it and partly because we want you to we want you all to see the spontaneity in English right yes connection is not is not planned yes and I think that's a very good point is so I think people have asked us before do we script out the whole episode no the only thing that might be scripted is an explanation of something you know we but well even that will usually change up well you know if we have a role play that's of course scripted but the general discussions our relationship how we how we talk to each other that's not scripted exactly I love it and then it comes to a recording day my favorite day of the week Michelle you and I meet we do a quick overview of the episode of what we'll be doing so we know what we're going into but we don't you know I think the cool thing about all there's English is we and we kind of we practice what we preach here we don't get stuck in perfectionism</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>We don't get stuck in perfectionism, right?</p>
<p>We we know what we want to teach We know our goal is to help you all come away feeling confident about being able to connect And so we don't sit there and analyze everything and get nervous before we hit record.</p>
<p>We don't have time We gotta get going we gotta get going on these episodes.</p>
<p>Yeah, we release a lot of episodes It's kind of a magic formula for reducing Anxiety is just creating a lot of what you're what you're doing and for our listeners That means speaking and connecting a lot because the more times you speak and connect with native speakers the less nervous You're gonna be each time.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly Exactly.</p>
<p>And then of course, you know, we add in any information We want to highlight or think their listeners should know if there's something special or maybe we want to thank our reviewers And then we turn on the video and we make sure that our settings are good, right?</p>
<p>Going yes all about the settings and our listeners need to</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>about the settings and our listeners need to know guys if you didn't know we're over on YouTube you know this this episode along with all the others is available on YouTube as a video so you can go check it out over there as well exactly so that's a little bit of all ears English but how can this help you with your speaking with your connection so as Lindsay said this is great for asking someone about their job or any sort of process they're into maybe they do woodwork whatever it is so we're gonna teach you a couple ways to talk about so so the first one is this expression day-to-day mm-hmm yeah meaning every day we want the the kind of the more mundane things in a way we want to know that information how does it look on a day-to-day basis right on a day-to-day basis or what goes into a X like our listener at Sophia asked us what goes into an episode what goes into making an episode right right so if your friend is learning to write</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>is learning to write music, right?</p>
<p>Maybe they're taking a music theory class or something, you'd say, well, so what goes into writing a song?</p>
<p>Yes, I've always been interested, if you were a restaurant owner, what goes into opening a restaurant for the evening?</p>
<p>You know, I find that interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, It's so easy and crazy, oh my gosh.</p>
<p>What else, Michelle?</p>
<p>What's something else our listeners could ask?</p>
<p>Well, you could say, how much time do you spend on blank, right?</p>
<p>So, or you could even say, how long does it take you to blank?</p>
<p>So, I mean, for the restaurant example, you could say, oh, how long does it take you to prepare for the night?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Or how much time do you spend on cleaning the place?</p>
<p>Or you could also say, you could mix these up.</p>
<p>How much time goes into?</p>
<p>Yep, yep.</p>
<p>There's a lot of different ways.</p>
<p>The important thing is just asking the question and starting that conversation.</p>
<p>Sometimes for our listeners, maybe they're finishing up with college, university, and thinking, what industry do I wanna be in?</p>
<p>This is a really important, these are questions we need to know.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>important.</p>
<p>These are questions we need to know because certain careers might look really glamorous, but on the day-to-day, maybe they're not as great.</p>
<p>Right, Yeah, I think that happens.</p>
<p>Yeah, So, but there's tons of ways to connect.</p>
<p>We gave you a few ways today.</p>
<p>Lindsay, should we, should we do a role play?</p>
<p>Yeah, let's do it.</p>
<p>So here we are friends and you are asking me about my new job.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So what's your day-to-day like?</p>
<p>Well, I go in every day and first look at the schedule and make sure I have everything prepared.</p>
<p>Oh, neat.</p>
<p>And how much time do you spend on gathering all the information together?</p>
<p>Just like 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And so what goes into a call with a client?</p>
<p>Well, we just talk over what they expect from us and what the schedule will be.</p>
<p>We go over any of their concerns.</p>
<p>It's pretty extensive actually.</p>
<p>Sounds like a lot.</p>
<p>Oh, nice.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Very natural conversation, wouldn't you say?</p>
<p>I would say.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>I would say.</p>
<p>Yeah, All right.</p>
<p>So, Michelle, first, you asked me this opening question, so what's your day-to-day like?</p>
<p>And I like this because it's kind of open-ended, but you're really being clear that you mean on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Don't tell me about the high points, just the great times when you're in the spotlight.</p>
<p>Tell me about the day-to-day, right?</p>
<p>Right, Yes, Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>And then I said, and how much time do you spend on gathering all the information together?</p>
<p>So getting more details from you.</p>
<p>And I said, 20 minutes.</p>
<p>And you said, okay, and what goes into a call with a client?</p>
<p>And what do you mean, what goes into, exactly, what does this mean, exactly?</p>
<p>What is involved?</p>
<p>What happens?</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, What happens?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>What's involved?</p>
<p>Maybe, did you have to prepare for it?</p>
<p>There's lots of sub-questions that could go under that.</p>
<p>Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>But yeah, there are so many places we could take this.</p>
<p>This is a huge topic.</p>
<p>But I think-</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p>This is a huge topic, but I think mainly is be curious.</p>
<p>Let that person shine.</p>
<p>Your friend has a new job, let them shine.</p>
<p>Your friend talks to you about their new hobby, let them shine and share it with you.</p>
<p>Show that you're interested.</p>
<p>I think this is also a really, these are good conversations to have because you know that expression there's no such thing as an overnight success.</p>
<p>Or I don't know, maybe it's a different expression, but the idea is, you know, this person has become successful.</p>
<p>Maybe you have a friend who's become a famous actor or actress and all of a sudden it looks to someone on the outside like they just made it all of a sudden.</p>
<p>But there's been years and years and years of work every day getting up and working late, working late nights.</p>
<p>And so that's another angle on this topic and this question.</p>
<p>We could learn the truth behind how hard someone has worked throughout their career.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, Absolutely.</p>
<p>Because you're, you're only seeing what's going on on the outside.</p>
<p>You don't see all the hard work, you know, all the, you know, you see the surface.</p>
<p>Surface level.</p>
<p>You don't see the 10,000.</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p>level.</p>
<p>You don't see the 10,000 hours, right?</p>
<p>Malcolm Gladwell's concept, the 10,000 hours to go into mastering a concept or a skill.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>Love that.</p>
<p>So, that's why it's good to have these conversations.</p>
<p>Lindsay, do we have another episode that will help our listeners?</p>
<p>Yes, we do, Michelle.</p>
<p>I'm glad you asked.</p>
<p>It's episode 2340.</p>
<p>Just scroll back a little bit further back, guys.</p>
<p>It's called, Do You Have the Gift of Gab in English?</p>
<p>And that's a common expression.</p>
<p>You're going to learn what it means and we'll go into that topic.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Okay, awesome.</p>
<p>So, takeaway for today, I would say be curious, ask questions, and just always let the other person have a chance to share themselves and that'll help with your connection.</p>
<p>Yeah, that'll help with your connection for sure.</p>
<p>And if you're looking to get into a certain industry, ask lots of questions like this.</p>
<p>Make sure you set up coffee dates, informational interviews, phone calls, build mentorships in that industry.</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p>Mentorships in that industry.</p>
<p>So you really know what you're going into.</p>
<p>You know, what are you really signing up for?</p>
<p>That's so important to make sure we make the right choices in our careers.</p>
<p>That's true You may like the idea of something but when it comes down to the day-to-day you learn about it Maybe you have to work every weekend Maybe you have maybe there's something that doesn't work with theirs with your lifestyle and what you're looking for So definitely good to ask about that and find out yeah, it's special Thank you to Sophia for asking this question.</p>
<p>And the final takeaway for our listeners Michelle is send in your question.</p>
<p>Yes Send your questions to support at all ears English calm.</p>
<p>All right, perfect.</p>
<p>All right, Lindsay thanks for talking about this with me today and Thanks for the question and we'll talk to you guys later.</p>
