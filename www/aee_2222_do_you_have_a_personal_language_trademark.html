<p>I say I love that all of the time.</p>
<p>What's your language trademark? Today? We reflect on this idea and we learn two other common ways to express your love.</p>
<p>Hello, Michelle.</p>
<p>How's it going? Good, Lindsay.</p>
<p>How are you? I'm doing pretty well today.</p>
<p>I have an exciting, we have an exciting topic today.</p>
<p>Do you have a question for me to start off the day Michelle? I definitely do.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Is there anything in your life that you absolutely love that? I love? Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>I love getting a good ice coffee on a warm day or a good hot coffee on a cold day.</p>
<p>Yes, Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That is a good one.</p>
<p>I love the same.</p>
<p>I, it's fun when it starts to get warm enough outside where you start to switch your coffees to ice coffee.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The seasons, right.</p>
<p>The change of seasons.</p>
<p>This is what makes life interesting.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>But actually Lindsay, there's something that apparently you say frequently I love these episodes and we have listeners asking about certain things that or pointing out things that we say, I know this is fun.</p>
<p>So Lindsay, we have a listener question about something you say.</p>
<p>So Lindsay, could you read the question? Well, it's true.</p>
<p>Michelle.</p>
<p>No one knows us better than our listeners in terms of what we say better than ourselves even, you know.</p>
<p>So, all right, here we go.</p>
<p>Here's the question.</p>
<p>Hi, Lindsay and team.</p>
<p>I'm Anne and I'm from France.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your podcast and for bringing such energetic, positive and supportive energy.</p>
<p>Let's say, uh I also have a question about an expression that Lindsay uses many times.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>So the expression is I love that or I love it.</p>
<p>Uh Could you give me, could you give us more context about it? I assume that it could fit many situations, couldn't it? Thank you again.</p>
<p>Love Anne.</p>
<p>Oh, good question.</p>
<p>An excellent.</p>
<p>This is fun.</p>
<p>This is fun.</p>
<p>OK, so we're gonna get into this.</p>
<p>But a couple of things, guys, if you haven't heard already, if you are listening on Spotify, we do these really fun interactive key polls about a topic that we discuss on the show.</p>
<p>So what happens if you're listening on Spotify, you can actually answer that key poll and in the future, we will share the results.</p>
<p>So it's a really great way to get in touch with you guys and interact with you, hear your opinions on certain things or how things relate to your life.</p>
<p>So there is going to be a key poll for this episode coming up.</p>
<p>So listen to the end and you will hear what that key poll is exactly.</p>
<p>And also guys before we go into the answer and explaining this phrase and when we use it and how we use it 22 08, go back and listen to that episode, politics or pivot English conversation tactics for divisive topics.</p>
<p>Aubrey and I did this episode together.</p>
<p>And it was to do, you know, when politics enters how to test out verbally whether someone wants to go into politics, different phrases, different touch and go phrases and go listen to that episode to learn how to do that.</p>
<p>Especially as we get into this heavy season Michelle, you know, we're about six months out from the election at this point, right? It's going to get heated.</p>
<p>So we want to have that those English skills.</p>
<p>Very important.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So Lindsay, now that Ann brought this up? Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you, do you, do you feel like she came on to something with you? Do you realize? Oh, you say I love that a lot? She might be on to something, Michelle, she might be on to something.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do.</p>
<p>I think I say I love that or I love it as almost a filler word.</p>
<p>Not exactly a filler word, but it's a positive response.</p>
<p>It's kind of instead of saying yeah.</p>
<p>Right, Like I hear you.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe I agree.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Right, Right, I, I, I think I probably use it as well but it did when she said it I realized, oh, yeah, she's probably right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But exactly it means that you enjoy something a certain point.</p>
<p>And did, I mean, well, more literally if you say, oh, I love that.</p>
<p>Right, If you're actually talking about, oh, I love it.</p>
<p>I love this ice cream.</p>
<p>Of course, we know that that's more literal.</p>
<p>I really enjoy something.</p>
<p>Um, but sometimes as Lindsay said, it's used more as a filler.</p>
<p>Um, I, I also think it can show some encouragement, some support and slightly in a little bit of a stronger way to, like you said to say, yeah.</p>
<p>Or that's true.</p>
<p>Um, I think that saying, oh, I love that.</p>
<p>That just, it sounds so.</p>
<p>Oh, thanks.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of ways this is what I would call a personal trademark, a personal language trademark, Michelle.</p>
<p>Um This is kind of my trademark.</p>
<p>It's because I'm a pretty positive person overall.</p>
<p>I want people to feel heard and I want to recognize when I, I'm excited about, I tend to get excited about things.</p>
<p>I'm curious and so that's, I think why, but that's, it's not necessarily for everyone.</p>
<p>It doesn't mean other people can't use it.</p>
<p>Of course, you can, you can make this your trademark if it fits with your personality, if it feels right.</p>
<p>Right, Michelle.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, and we've done other, we've come into conversations about some of my trademarks and one of them was I feel funny.</p>
<p>So if we, if we did ever get those t-shirts, yeah.</p>
<p>My, I guess the Michelle one would be, I feel funny.</p>
<p>Maybe the Lindsay one would be.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>Yes, 100%.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So let's do an example.</p>
<p>Lindsay.</p>
<p>Maybe we should get stickers for all E English.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Good, good, good, good.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So our listeners have heard me say this.</p>
<p>Um, what else Michelle, what else do we need to know here? Is this formal informal? What do we need to know? It's kind of informal sounding? But I wouldn't say it's so informal that it's a total slang or anything like that? I, I, I do believe you could use this at the workplace.</p>
<p>It's interesting.</p>
<p>Sometimes we might say I love that or sometimes we might just say love that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Also that is also another good way.</p>
<p>Very common.</p>
<p>You'll hear native speakers say love that, love that.</p>
<p>It just depends on the context.</p>
<p>Right, Yes, Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>So today we are going to share two other trendy expressions with the word love.</p>
<p>And it's interesting, I've been meaning to do episodes on each of these.</p>
<p>So it was a perfect way to segue.</p>
<p>So great question.</p>
<p>So OK, what is the first one, Lindsay? All right.</p>
<p>So the first one is love that for you.</p>
<p>Now, this one is trendy.</p>
<p>I will say it's trendy, right? You hear this? I think more with women than men, I would say, but it doesn't mean men can't use it if it's your personal trademark? Awesome, right? Um What kinds of scenarios will we hear this to me? Love that for you.</p>
<p>It can be just genuine.</p>
<p>Oh You got a new dress.</p>
<p>I love that for you.</p>
<p>That's great.</p>
<p>But to me in this new trendy way, it's used almost a little bit sarcastically.</p>
<p>What do you think Lindsay? OK, Yeah, let's do an example.</p>
<p>Let's do an example.</p>
<p>So we can see what I mean, like as a way of empathizing is what you're saying.</p>
<p>Kind of sort of OK, let's, let's, let's see.</p>
<p>Yeah, here we go, we go Ok.</p>
<p>I have to go on a two hour drive just to pick up my sister from the train.</p>
<p>Oh, love that for you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Really? Oh, so we're empathizing.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Have you heard it being used in that way? Ok.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I will say like my daughter's babysitter sometimes we'll be talking and I'll say, oh, I had to do this and this and then I have to get all the snacks ready for my kids and say love that for you.</p>
<p>Oh Yeah.</p>
<p>A way of saying, oh gosh, it's almost in a way like I feel your pain or I feel your pain, right? It's so that is a way that I think is pretty interesting how to use it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>OK, So there's another one Michelle here, which is, we love to see it.</p>
<p>Now, where does this come from? When do we use this? So I hear this a lot from Instagram influencers.</p>
<p>Um I hear it.</p>
<p>Maybe somebody would say it at the 00, I know when I hear it.</p>
<p>If I'm doing maybe a Peloton ride, the instructor might say that um other different ways.</p>
<p>Do you hear this? Lindsay? We love to see it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I feel like it does have a bit of a Peloton vibe or like a workout teacher vibe.</p>
<p>It's encouraging, right? It's when you're encouraging someone you're saying, congratulations on a success for something, right? Let's do a roleplay.</p>
<p>Let's jump right into the roleplay to make it clear.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So uh go ahead.</p>
<p>We're coworkers.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Coworkers.</p>
<p>Oh, we just got another sale.</p>
<p>Ah, we love to see it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So this is broadly speaking, we means our company like we are, this is a group effort.</p>
<p>But could it also be if it's not a group effort? If I if you made a sale for your company, we love to see it.</p>
<p>So sometimes I'll hear certain people that I follow on Instagram who have small businesses, they will post reviews that they've received or some sort of progress, some sort of sort of a success, for example, a personal trainer.</p>
<p>Um, it's not that I have a personal trainer but thinking I'm an example here, they might post results like before and after on their Instagram and then, right, we love to see it.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Got it, got it, got it.</p>
<p>So it's just broadly saying, hey, something good is happening.</p>
<p>Let's note this, right.</p>
<p>Let's take a moment and celebrate this.</p>
<p>It's possible there are other ways to use these more slangy ways that I, that I'm not familiar with, but that's one way that I hear it.</p>
<p>They're very lighthearted, fun, um, general kind of informal.</p>
<p>But uh I think I love that is more ok for work.</p>
<p>I don't know about, we love to see it unless it's a little bit less formal.</p>
<p>What do you think? Yeah, I think with these more informal expressions.</p>
<p>Uh, just listen and see if you hear it.</p>
<p>Wait until you know your workplace.</p>
<p>Well, right, until you kind of bring in these rare, more rare expressions, more trendy expressions, that's what I would do, you know? Yeah.</p>
<p>Let me make sure you understand them.</p>
<p>These are absolutely trendy for sure.</p>
<p>Well, we're here to teach the trends in the, you know, evergreen language, Michelle.</p>
<p>So it's all good.</p>
<p>It's all good.</p>
<p>Uh Do we want to do our key poll now for our listeners at this moment? Sure, we can do it now.</p>
<p>So the question is so Anne figured out Lindsay is what we're calling today, the personal language trademark.</p>
<p>So, and I have, I have them, Lindsay has them, we all kind of have them, but we want to know from you.</p>
<p>The question today is, do you have a personal language trademark? Yes or no.</p>
<p>So, is there something and you could even comment in because there's an area to comment on Spotify, right? So I believe so you could even maybe comment.</p>
<p>If you would like, uh answer the poll, you can comment maybe what your trademark is.</p>
<p>I'm really curious to hear what it is.</p>
<p>Is there something that people say, you say all the time, maybe somebody's pointed it out to you, maybe you realize it for yourself.</p>
<p>Maybe you've adopted a new expression that you really like and you're using it a lot.</p>
<p>So let us know that's so fun.</p>
<p>And I'll probably send out an email hopefully to our email list.</p>
<p>We've been emailing a lot with our, our listeners on our list and getting to know you guys a bit more asking you to respond to questions.</p>
<p>I'm probably going to ask this question to the email list.</p>
<p>You know, do you have a personal language trademark? And if you answer there, you'll have a chance to actually tell me, you know what your personal language trademark is.</p>
<p>Michelle, that could be really fun to hear from our listeners and see, you know, in their own languages.</p>
<p>That would, yeah, that would be fun.</p>
<p>Yeah, it could be something from your own, your first language, another language you speak or English.</p>
<p>So let's do a role play now, Michelle um here we are friends.</p>
<p>We're walking around New York City too bad.</p>
<p>We never lived in New York at the same time.</p>
<p>We in New York at different times.</p>
<p>That would have been fun.</p>
<p>If we were doing all our English in New York together, that would have been fun.</p>
<p>All right, cool.</p>
<p>So, here we go.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Hey, we should check out the village before we head back to the hotel.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>You always come up with the best ideas.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>There are discount tickets to Hamilton for tomorrow night.</p>
<p>We love to see it.</p>
<p>Let's get them.</p>
<p>I can't wait.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>Oh, gross.</p>
<p>I think I stepped in gum.</p>
<p>Oh, no, I love that for you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Really funny.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>Ok, so let's walk through this to make sure we're super clear.</p>
<p>So um all my trademark here.</p>
<p>Right, I said we should check out the village and when I say the village, we mean like the east village, the west village, Greenwich Village.</p>
<p>Right, Right, When I hear, when I hear the village, I think mostly of like Greenwich Village, Greenwich Village.</p>
<p>I think more of the west side, but kind of, yeah, so kind of like the area where N Y U is where um uh Washington Square Park is that we always talk about on this show that we love so much.</p>
<p>Right, Michelle that area.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's a great area guys.</p>
<p>If you, if you go to New York, uh anytime soon, definitely check out Washington Square Park.</p>
<p>It's super amazing.</p>
<p>So then, all right.</p>
<p>So you said before we do, let's do this before we head back to the hotel.</p>
<p>And I said, I, I love that.</p>
<p>You said, I love that you always come up with the best ideas.</p>
<p>So essentially what you're saying is, yeah, let's do it.</p>
<p>I'm on board.</p>
<p>Right, Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And now we're going to go on to the more of the trendy one.</p>
<p>So trendy.</p>
<p>Now you said there are discount tickets to Hamilton for tomorrow night and I said we love to see it.</p>
<p>Right, So it's just another way of saying.</p>
<p>That's awesome.</p>
<p>Right, Oh Wow.</p>
<p>We love to see it.</p>
<p>Now again, this is very trendy.</p>
<p>Not everybody is going to be using this frequently all the time.</p>
<p>This might be a situation where you listen for it and you see what happens before you, if you, if you're uncomfortable, if you want to give it a try, go give it a try.</p>
<p>But if you, if you'd like to hear some more examples, it is, this is trendy.</p>
<p>I do not think this is going to last.</p>
<p>I just want to say that.</p>
<p>Oh, we should do.</p>
<p>I'm sure we've done them but we could do some more episodes on trends that died, right? Language trends that died.</p>
<p>That would be fun.</p>
<p>Guys hit follow on all English right now.</p>
<p>So you don't miss that episode, it will be coming up.</p>
<p>Um So we love to see it, right? So just showing excitement, encouragement again, I don't really say this.</p>
<p>So you don't have to use it guys, just listen for it trendy again, right? And then I said definitely, oh gross.</p>
<p>I think I stepped in gum and then you said I said, oh, no love that for you.</p>
<p>So here I'm really empathizing.</p>
<p>It's, you know, it's not the worst thing in the world to step in gum.</p>
<p>It's not great.</p>
<p>Um So I'm just, I'm using my personality to, to express myself, but again, very slang.</p>
<p>I'm not sure I would even feel comfortable using this.</p>
<p>Yeah, that much.</p>
<p>But I hear it, I hear it so frequently that it's something that I wanted to bring up.</p>
<p>Do you hear it more Michelle in that sarcastic sense, meaning the opposite of what you mean versus the more genuine sense.</p>
<p>Like, oh, I got a, I got a job.</p>
<p>It's, it's 100% work from home and I can take trips and, and work from the beach.</p>
<p>Love that for you.</p>
<p>Right, That's the more genuine way, which I, that's the one I knew actually.</p>
<p>Um, do you like, which do you hear more nowadays out in the world of trends, language trends? Uh I, I might, it might be kind of equal.</p>
<p>I do think that there's kind of this little spark of attitude that's coming out with this one for more of the sarcastic way.</p>
<p>But, but, you know, so it's interesting because if you are listening for this, you really have to think about.</p>
<p>Wait, are they being sarcastic? Are they being funny? Are they being genuine? Right, I mean, the tone of voice and context.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, you should be able to get it guys if you're listening in but pay attention to this one and get a sense of if you're hearing it in the more straightforward genuine way, which we didn't talk as much today about.</p>
<p>But the example I just used is great.</p>
<p>Let's say someone got a new job, but it's a fantastic gig.</p>
<p>It's work from home.</p>
<p>It's work from anywhere.</p>
<p>It's high paying job.</p>
<p>Love that for you.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>Right, Genuine versus you stepped in gum.</p>
<p>Love that for you sar empathizing.</p>
<p>And I, and I do want to say that the easier, not easier, but the more comfortable thing to do in the beginning might be to use the more genuine one.</p>
<p>Right, That's, that's a little bit of a smoother start because it might not be in your personality to use the sarcastic way.</p>
<p>It might just feel better for you and it's like you can start off using them genuine ways sometimes that's just the better way to practice.</p>
<p>Yeah, the stepping stones here, stepping stones.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Um Michelle, thanks for bringing this topic about language and trademarks and about trends in these phrases about love.</p>
<p>Any final thoughts for our listeners? Yeah, these, these are fun.</p>
<p>Try them out if you feel more comfortable listening before you try it.</p>
<p>That's fine.</p>
<p>Um Go on Instagram because uh and and follow some small businesses because I think that that might be where you see that we love to see it a lot.</p>
<p>Um But it when in doubt, go with the more genuine usage of something first till you get a little bit more comfortable because not everybody is going to be using this more sarcastic trendy way of using the expression.</p>
<p>So if that that's I feel more comfortable with the with the genuine ways of using it, but I hear the other ones a lot and they're fun if you want to go for it.</p>
<p>Do it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And guys don't forget to answer our poll for today and think about whether you have a language trademark.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be any of these three.</p>
<p>It could be literally anything.</p>
<p>But do you have one? You know, and maybe share it with us.</p>
<p>All right, cool.</p>
<p>Michelle.</p>
<p>Talk to you very soon.</p>
<p>Have a good one.</p>
<p>You too.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
