<p>Hey, Lindsay, at some point today, should we answer a listener question?</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>answer a listener question?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say at some point we absolutely should.</p>
<p>100%. How about now?</p>
<p>How about now?</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Yeah, Lindsay, today we have a really good listener question.</p>
<p>I'm excited to get to this episode.</p>
<p>And this question comes to us on YouTube, and it's from Esan Salabadi.</p>
<p>I'm 1500.</p>
<p>I'm sorry in advance if I messed up your name.</p>
<p>All right, I'm going to go ahead and read the listener question.</p>
<p>Again, yep, like you said, Michelle, this comes from YouTube.</p>
<p>So guys, don't forget, we are over on YouTube.</p>
<p>These videos are being recorded as videos that you can actually watch if you learn better through watching.</p>
<p>Go over there and hit subscribe.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So shall I read it, Michelle?</p>
<p>Go for it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So they said, I like your energetic voices.</p>
<p>Make my day every time.</p>
<p>They make my day every time.</p>
<p>That's so nice.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>every time.</p>
<p>That's so nice.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I was wondering if you could talk about the different uses of the word some and at some point.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Yeah, Good question.</p>
<p>Good question.</p>
<p>So interestingly enough, this was not answering this listener's question, but you and Aubrey did an episode about some words with some and this was just kind of recently, I think Saturday, March 29th, was somehow or other this vocabulary is extremely tricky.</p>
<p>So this is good because you can listen to that one and this one and get lots of examples with some, somehow.</p>
<p>So but we're going to go through this listener question today and give you some other examples of how some is used.</p>
<p>Yeah, so some just seems to be coming up a lot these days.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Good stuff.</p>
<p>So guys, the first thing to do right now before we get going is hit the follow button, whether you're listening in</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>button, whether you're listening in Apple or Spotify or whatever podcast player you use to listen, or if you're on YouTube, hit that subscribe button.</p>
<p>All right?</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>Good stuff.</p>
<p>So it is a good question, Michelle.</p>
<p>Yeah, And as you said, this is kind of a part two, a little bit, right?</p>
<p>Follow-up.</p>
<p>Yeah, So let's get to it.</p>
<p>So at some point, so when we say at some point, let's answer a listener question.</p>
<p>Now, is the some, is that meaning something specific or is it determined and set in stone?</p>
<p>It's really more general.</p>
<p>We don't have specifics.</p>
<p>It means really at any point, at some point.</p>
<p>It just means it's more about, yes, we're going to do that, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>It could be soon.</p>
<p>It could be a little later.</p>
<p>So for example, at some point, she will probably need braces.</p>
<p>Yeah, So maybe you realize that your kid's teeth are not straight and you're not saying next year or when.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>You're not saying next year or when, you're just saying at some point, right?</p>
<p>Did you have braces, Lindsay?</p>
<p>I did have braces at kind of a young age when I was like, I think nine, 10.</p>
<p>Yeah, Did you?</p>
<p>Yeah, I still have a lower retainer in my mouth.</p>
<p>Yeah, Very common in the U.S., in American culture, to get braces when you're a teenager or a kid.</p>
<p>Yes, it's kind of a rite of passage in some ways.</p>
<p>It really is, yeah.</p>
<p>We have another sample sentence here, Michelle.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I will probably give you a call at some point to ask about the housing market in your neighborhood.</p>
<p>Yes, and this is kind of good because you prime people to, you're not nailing them down and saying, okay, I want to meet you next Wednesday at the coffee shop and I'm going to ask you questions.</p>
<p>It's sort of feeling it out if they're willing to talk about that or it's warning them kind of, hey, sometime in the next few months, I'm going to call you.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>I'm going to call you.</p>
<p>Yeah, Noncommittal.</p>
<p>Right, Noncommittal.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, It's just very nonspecific.</p>
<p>And so it's really good for, you know, not pressuring someone too much, not making them feel overwhelmed.</p>
<p>And also, you know, for yourself saying, okay, well, we know what's going to happen.</p>
<p>So it doesn't necessarily matter exactly when.</p>
<p>And exactly.</p>
<p>And this follows up with the other ideas, similar ideas, someday, right?</p>
<p>Sometime and somehow.</p>
<p>We have examples for each of these.</p>
<p>So for example, for someday, I hope for peace in the world someday.</p>
<p>We don't know when, but someday, right?</p>
<p>Or sometime.</p>
<p>Give me a call sometime.</p>
<p>So at a point in time, I mean, that's the same idea, right?</p>
<p>Give me a call at some point, right?</p>
<p>But sometime is the idea.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Or somehow.</p>
<p>You know, somehow there has to be a way for us to finish this.</p>
<p>And that's part of what Aubrey and I talked about, I believe.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yeah,</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>talked about, I believe.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And this one, as I was planning it, it made me laugh because do you know West Side Story at all?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I know the play.</p>
<p>Remember that song?</p>
<p>I won't sing it, but somehow, someday.</p>
<p>Yeah, there's a place for us.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that's what this episode made me think of.</p>
<p>Right, I love it.</p>
<p>Yeah, reference to Broadway, right?</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Okay, and then there are three others where we bring in some, somewhere, someone, and something.</p>
<p>I mean, these words are all over the English language.</p>
<p>Oh, everywhere.</p>
<p>So yeah, somewhere, which is I think the name of that song in West Side Story.</p>
<p>So I want to go somewhere warm this winter, right?</p>
<p>So we know we want to go somewhere, but it's noncommittal as to where.</p>
<p>We just know that we want it to be warm.</p>
<p>This is like the ideation stage of things, right?</p>
<p>We're kind of ideating on something.</p>
<p>And then someone, she's someone special.</p>
<p>This is maybe you've been on a date.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>on a date and you realize this person might be special to you.</p>
<p>She's someone special, right?</p>
<p>Or your friend or something.</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>I mean, this is kind of an interesting one.</p>
<p>I realize someone is a little bit unique because you are talking about someone specific there, right?</p>
<p>So it can be someone.</p>
<p>Yeah, I realize that about someone.</p>
<p>But yeah, I don't know why that's the one that's a little bit different, right?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, that is interesting.</p>
<p>Right, because the others follow the pattern of being more broad, less specific, like something.</p>
<p>Do you want something to eat?</p>
<p>I'm not saying do you want carrots to eat.</p>
<p>I'm saying do you want something to eat, right?</p>
<p>Right, right, right, right.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So unspecified.</p>
<p>So let's go over, I wanted to go over one more fun way to use some.</p>
<p>And this is to be emphatic.</p>
<p>So this is a very slang</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>So this is a very slang type of way, a very unique way to use it.</p>
<p>So here, I'll do an example.</p>
<p>She's some good singer.</p>
<p>Yes, I love this.</p>
<p>Very slangy, very slangy.</p>
<p>And intonation matters here too.</p>
<p>So what are you saying?</p>
<p>So she's some good singer.</p>
<p>I'm basically saying she's a really good singer, right?</p>
<p>It's just being very emphatic.</p>
<p>I'm very enthusiastic about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I've also heard, I feel like this is one of my dad's slangs.</p>
<p>He used to say something like, that is some kind of great.</p>
<p>That is some kind of great.</p>
<p>Like your grades or something, whatever.</p>
<p>You won the tennis match.</p>
<p>Some kind of great or something.</p>
<p>He would put something after that, usually an adjective.</p>
<p>Some kind of funny.</p>
<p>He's some kind of funny.</p>
<p>Yeah, I've heard that.</p>
<p>This is just really, this is slangy, slangy stuff here.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Or what's another example of a sentence?</p>
<p>That was some argument they had.</p>
<p>I hope they're okay now.</p>
<p>And we really need to punch.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>And we really need to punch the sum.</p>
<p>That was some argument they had.</p>
<p>So this is very different from what we've been talking about, something, someone, somewhere, right?</p>
<p>Very different.</p>
<p>Right, Or that was some expensive gift he got me.</p>
<p>So it's like if you were to rearrange that or say it in a different way, you could say like, oh, the gift he got me was really expensive.</p>
<p>Or that argument they had was really intense.</p>
<p>Or she's a really good singer.</p>
<p>Right, But this is just a different way to do it.</p>
<p>Lindsay, I think it's pretty fairly common.</p>
<p>I think so too.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it emphasizes it's a way to show your personality using some.</p>
<p>Usually we just use some in a very broad, general, kind of boring way.</p>
<p>But you can have some fun here, right?</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Some fun.</p>
<p>Let's do a couple of conversation questions while we have time.</p>
<p>Lindsay, where would you like to live someday?</p>
<p>Wow, someday I would love to live</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>love to live maybe in someplace warm, Michelle.</p>
<p>I don't know, maybe New Zealand or Australia or something.</p>
<p>It'd be very exotic for me.</p>
<p>I think I would like to live, yeah, maybe a warmer city.</p>
<p>A warmer city, I know.</p>
<p>I really feel like I could give up winter at this point.</p>
<p>That's what my partner always says too.</p>
<p>Like, we could just maybe not have winter anymore.</p>
<p>I know about that.</p>
<p>But you and the skiing, you gotta have winter.</p>
<p>I know, but you know what?</p>
<p>I don't think I love skiing enough to really not give it up.</p>
<p>I think I could give it up.</p>
<p>I love to ski because I live here and that's what people do and I'm good at it and I'll do it.</p>
<p>It's a good way to spend the day, get outdoors, but I could live without it.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, good to know, good to know.</p>
<p>Who is someone special you keep in touch with from your childhood?</p>
<p>So this is interesting though, because I am</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>This is interesting, though, because now I am using it in more of a noncommittal way, right?</p>
<p>It could be like anyone, right?</p>
<p>And that's a whole other topic.</p>
<p>It can be kind of either.</p>
<p>It's just interesting however you use it.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm not really in touch with any teachers.</p>
<p>Some people will keep in touch with their second grade teacher or middle school teacher.</p>
<p>I'm not.</p>
<p>But maybe my best friend from middle school, and she was actually in my wedding, which is very cool.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I'd say that was someone that's someone who has been special to me.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, that's very nice.</p>
<p>Yeah, I keep in touch with actually I just saw my phone is sitting over here and I just saw that I got a missed call from someone special from my childhood.</p>
<p>One of my two best friends from childhood.</p>
<p>So that's nice.</p>
<p>I have to give her a call later.</p>
<p>Should we do a role play?</p>
<p>Yeah, let's do it, Michelle.</p>
<p>So here we are about to see a movie.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>Here, we are about to see a movie together.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Okay, should we get something to snack on during the movie?</p>
<p>Sure, popcorn?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, let's do it.</p>
<p>This place has some good popcorn.</p>
<p>It's the best movie theater popcorn I've ever had.</p>
<p>I can't wait to try it.</p>
<p>Oh, remind me, I want to introduce you to someone.</p>
<p>My friend Larry says his daughter knows you from law school.</p>
<p>Oh, do you know her name?</p>
<p>He told me, but somehow I can't remember.</p>
<p>Okay, text it to me sometime when you remember.</p>
<p>What's the actor in this movie's name?</p>
<p>Paul something?</p>
<p>Oh, Paul Rudd.</p>
<p>Oh, I love him.</p>
<p>I have to tell you about this new book I read at some point, also.</p>
<p>Okay, nice.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Some is coming in here, and that wouldn't be uncommon to see some entering the conversation in all these iterations, right?</p>
<p>It's just so common.</p>
<p>I mean, it's just like everywhere.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's everywhere.</p>
<p>So I said, should we get something to snack on during the movie?</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>snack on during the movie.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And then you said, yes, let's do it, right?</p>
<p>This place has some good popcorn.</p>
<p>And this is this way of expressing our personalities, really emphasizing it has great popcorn.</p>
<p>It has some good popcorn.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And then you said, oh, remind me, I want to introduce you to someone.</p>
<p>So this is a specific person.</p>
<p>So interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, interesting.</p>
<p>And then you said, do you know her name?</p>
<p>And I said, he told me, somehow I can't remember.</p>
<p>Yeah, And then I said, okay, text it to me sometime when you remember.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>And then you said, what's the actor's name in this movie?</p>
<p>And I said, oh, Paul something.</p>
<p>And this is a common way when we can't come up with someone's last name.</p>
<p>Usually it's actually for people we know, right?</p>
<p>Mike something, do you know him?</p>
<p>He was at the party last week.</p>
<p>But I guess you could use it for famous actors too, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Sure.</p>
<p>Paul Rudd, who it's funny because we were talking about Clueless and that he's in Clueless.</p>
<p>I think he's that.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>People say that he's aging like incredibly well.</p>
<p>Or was that him or someone else?</p>
<p>Yeah, it's him.</p>
<p>They say he's like aging backwards.</p>
<p>Reverse aging or something.</p>
<p>Benjamin Button action going on.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>He's Benjamin Buttoning.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Oh, he's gorgeous.</p>
<p>I have such a crush on him.</p>
<p>He looks just as good now as he did in Clueless.</p>
<p>I mean, that was 20 years ago.</p>
<p>He's adorable.</p>
<p>Anyway, now you guys know one of my celebrity crushes.</p>
<p>I have a crush on him, too.</p>
<p>It's okay.</p>
<p>He's adorable.</p>
<p>He's got great eyes, right?</p>
<p>Great eyes.</p>
<p>Yeah, Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>We can't stop ourselves.</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>That's funny.</p>
<p>And then you said love him.</p>
<p>Everyone loves him.</p>
<p>So I have to tell you about this new book I read at some point.</p>
<p>And then you said, oh, topic.</p>
<p>Yeah, And here you're saying, I'm going to tell you sometime.</p>
<p>Maybe it'll be today.</p>
<p>Maybe it'll be next time we hang out.</p>
<p>Right, We'll talk about the book.</p>
<p>Yeah, Now I'm blushing about Paul Rudd.</p>
<p>Oh, Michelle.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>Oh, Michelle.</p>
<p>I won't tell Dan, don't worry.</p>
<p>Yeah, don't tell.</p>
<p>Okay, so, well, this was a really fun question.</p>
<p>Thank you so much to our listener for that question.</p>
<p>And Lindsay, takeaways for today?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, who knew that some could be so fun, right?</p>
<p>Who knew it?</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>We love good questions, guys.</p>
<p>So go ahead and send your good specific question to support at allearsenglish.com.</p>
<p>And if you're at the C1 or even C2 level, or high B1, pay special attention to the section where we talked about some good singer, right?</p>
<p>Or that was some argument they had.</p>
<p>This is a really interesting way of showing your personality, right?</p>
<p>Go back to that piece, play it again, study that piece, because you may already know the other iterations of some, but up your level.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p>but up your level.</p>
<p>Every time with these episodes, you want to find something that is challenging and up your level with that.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
