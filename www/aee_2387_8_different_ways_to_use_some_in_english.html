<p id="p-19">How's everything going in your world today?</p>
<p id="p-20">Everything is good.</p>
<p id="p-21">Hey, Lindsay, at some point today, should we answer a listener question?</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-22">answer a listener question?</p>
<p id="p-23">Yeah, I would say at some point we absolutely should.</p>
<p id="p-24">100%. How about now?</p>
<p id="p-25">How about now?</p>
<p id="p-26">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-27">Yeah, Lindsay, today we have a really good listener question.</p>
<p id="p-28">I'm excited to get to this episode.</p>
<p id="p-29">And this question comes to us on YouTube, and it's from Esan Salabadi.</p>
<p id="p-30">I'm 1500.</p>
<p id="p-31">I'm sorry in advance if I messed up your name.</p>
<p id="p-32">All right, I'm going to go ahead and read the listener question.</p>
<p id="p-33">Again, yep, like you said, Michelle, this comes from YouTube.</p>
<p id="p-34">So guys, don't forget, we are over on YouTube.</p>
<p id="p-35">These videos are being recorded as videos that you can actually watch if you learn better through watching.</p>
<p id="p-36">Go over there and hit subscribe.</p>
<p id="p-37">All right.</p>
<p id="p-38">So shall I read it, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-39">Go for it.</p>
<p id="p-40">All right.</p>
<p id="p-41">So they said, I like your energetic voices.</p>
<p id="p-42">Make my day every time.</p>
<p id="p-43">They make my day every time.</p>
<p id="p-44">That's so nice.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-45">every time.</p>
<p id="p-46">That's so nice.</p>
<p id="p-47">Thank you.</p>
<p id="p-48">I was wondering if you could talk about the different uses of the word some and at some point.</p>
<p id="p-49">Ooh.</p>
<p id="p-50">Yeah, Good question.</p>
<p id="p-51">Good question.</p>
<p id="p-52">So interestingly enough, this was not answering this listener's question, but you and Aubrey did an episode about some words with some and this was just kind of recently, I think Saturday, March 29th, was somehow or other this vocabulary is extremely tricky.</p>
<p id="p-53">So this is good because you can listen to that one and this one and get lots of examples with some, somehow.</p>
<p id="p-54">So but we're going to go through this listener question today and give you some other examples of how some is used.</p>
<p id="p-55">Yeah, so some just seems to be coming up a lot these days.</p>
<p id="p-56">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-57">Good stuff.</p>
<p id="p-58">So guys, the first thing to do right now before we get going is hit the follow button, whether you're listening in</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-59">button, whether you're listening in Apple or Spotify or whatever podcast player you use to listen, or if you're on YouTube, hit that subscribe button.</p>
<p id="p-60">All right?</p>
<p id="p-61">Definitely.</p>
<p id="p-62">Good stuff.</p>
<p id="p-63">So it is a good question, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-64">Yeah, And as you said, this is kind of a part two, a little bit, right?</p>
<p id="p-65">Follow-up.</p>
<p id="p-66">Yeah, So let's get to it.</p>
<p id="p-67">So at some point, so when we say at some point, let's answer a listener question.</p>
<p id="p-68">Now, is the some, is that meaning something specific or is it determined and set in stone?</p>
<p id="p-69">It's really more general.</p>
<p id="p-70">We don't have specifics.</p>
<p id="p-71">It means really at any point, at some point.</p>
<p id="p-72">It just means it's more about, yes, we're going to do that, right?</p>
<p id="p-73">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-74">It could be soon.</p>
<p id="p-75">It could be a little later.</p>
<p id="p-76">So for example, at some point, she will probably need braces.</p>
<p id="p-77">Yeah, So maybe you realize that your kid's teeth are not straight and you're not saying next year or when.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-78">You're not saying next year or when, you're just saying at some point, right?</p>
<p id="p-79">Did you have braces, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-80">I did have braces at kind of a young age when I was like, I think nine, 10.</p>
<p id="p-81">Yeah, Did you?</p>
<p id="p-82">Yeah, I still have a lower retainer in my mouth.</p>
<p id="p-83">Yeah, Very common in the U.S., in American culture, to get braces when you're a teenager or a kid.</p>
<p id="p-84">Yes, it's kind of a rite of passage in some ways.</p>
<p id="p-85">It really is, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-86">We have another sample sentence here, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-87">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-88">I will probably give you a call at some point to ask about the housing market in your neighborhood.</p>
<p id="p-89">Yes, and this is kind of good because you prime people to, you're not nailing them down and saying, okay, I want to meet you next Wednesday at the coffee shop and I'm going to ask you questions.</p>
<p id="p-90">It's sort of feeling it out if they're willing to talk about that or it's warning them kind of, hey, sometime in the next few months, I'm going to call you.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-91">I'm going to call you.</p>
<p id="p-92">Yeah, Noncommittal.</p>
<p id="p-93">Right, Noncommittal.</p>
<p id="p-94">I like that.</p>
<p id="p-95">Yeah, It's just very nonspecific.</p>
<p id="p-96">And so it's really good for, you know, not pressuring someone too much, not making them feel overwhelmed.</p>
<p id="p-97">And also, you know, for yourself saying, okay, well, we know what's going to happen.</p>
<p id="p-98">So it doesn't necessarily matter exactly when.</p>
<p id="p-99">And exactly.</p>
<p id="p-100">And this follows up with the other ideas, similar ideas, someday, right?</p>
<p id="p-101">Sometime and somehow.</p>
<p id="p-102">We have examples for each of these.</p>
<p id="p-103">So for example, for someday, I hope for peace in the world someday.</p>
<p id="p-104">We don't know when, but someday, right?</p>
<p id="p-105">Or sometime.</p>
<p id="p-106">Give me a call sometime.</p>
<p id="p-107">So at a point in time, I mean, that's the same idea, right?</p>
<p id="p-108">Give me a call at some point, right?</p>
<p id="p-109">But sometime is the idea.</p>
<p id="p-110">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-111">Or somehow.</p>
<p id="p-112">You know, somehow there has to be a way for us to finish this.</p>
<p id="p-113">And that's part of what Aubrey and I talked about, I believe.</p>
<p id="p-114">Right?</p>
<p id="p-115">Yeah,</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-116">talked about, I believe.</p>
<p id="p-117">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-118">And this one, as I was planning it, it made me laugh because do you know West Side Story at all?</p>
<p id="p-119">Yeah, yeah, I know the play.</p>
<p id="p-120">Remember that song?</p>
<p id="p-121">I won't sing it, but somehow, someday.</p>
<p id="p-122">Yeah, there's a place for us.</p>
<p id="p-123">Yeah, so that's what this episode made me think of.</p>
<p id="p-124">Right, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-125">Yeah, reference to Broadway, right?</p>
<p id="p-126">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-127">Okay, and then there are three others where we bring in some, somewhere, someone, and something.</p>
<p id="p-128">I mean, these words are all over the English language.</p>
<p id="p-129">Oh, everywhere.</p>
<p id="p-130">So yeah, somewhere, which is I think the name of that song in West Side Story.</p>
<p id="p-131">So I want to go somewhere warm this winter, right?</p>
<p id="p-132">So we know we want to go somewhere, but it's noncommittal as to where.</p>
<p id="p-133">We just know that we want it to be warm.</p>
<p id="p-134">This is like the ideation stage of things, right?</p>
<p id="p-135">We're kind of ideating on something.</p>
<p id="p-136">And then someone, she's someone special.</p>
<p id="p-137">This is maybe you've been on a date.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-138">on a date and you realize this person might be special to you.</p>
<p id="p-139">She's someone special, right?</p>
<p id="p-140">Or your friend or something.</p>
<p id="p-141">Right, right, right.</p>
<p id="p-142">I mean, this is kind of an interesting one.</p>
<p id="p-143">I realize someone is a little bit unique because you are talking about someone specific there, right?</p>
<p id="p-144">So it can be someone.</p>
<p id="p-145">Yeah, I realize that about someone.</p>
<p id="p-146">But yeah, I don't know why that's the one that's a little bit different, right?</p>
<p id="p-147">Well, yeah, that is interesting.</p>
<p id="p-148">Right, because the others follow the pattern of being more broad, less specific, like something.</p>
<p id="p-149">Do you want something to eat?</p>
<p id="p-150">I'm not saying do you want carrots to eat.</p>
<p id="p-151">I'm saying do you want something to eat, right?</p>
<p id="p-152">Right, right, right, right.</p>
<p id="p-153">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-154">So unspecified.</p>
<p id="p-155">So let's go over, I wanted to go over one more fun way to use some.</p>
<p id="p-156">And this is to be emphatic.</p>
<p id="p-157">So this is a very slang</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-158">So this is a very slang type of way, a very unique way to use it.</p>
<p id="p-159">So here, I'll do an example.</p>
<p id="p-160">She's some good singer.</p>
<p id="p-161">Yes, I love this.</p>
<p id="p-162">Very slangy, very slangy.</p>
<p id="p-163">And intonation matters here too.</p>
<p id="p-164">So what are you saying?</p>
<p id="p-165">So she's some good singer.</p>
<p id="p-166">I'm basically saying she's a really good singer, right?</p>
<p id="p-167">It's just being very emphatic.</p>
<p id="p-168">I'm very enthusiastic about it.</p>
<p id="p-169">Yeah, I've also heard, I feel like this is one of my dad's slangs.</p>
<p id="p-170">He used to say something like, that is some kind of great.</p>
<p id="p-171">That is some kind of great.</p>
<p id="p-172">Like your grades or something, whatever.</p>
<p id="p-173">You won the tennis match.</p>
<p id="p-174">Some kind of great or something.</p>
<p id="p-175">He would put something after that, usually an adjective.</p>
<p id="p-176">Some kind of funny.</p>
<p id="p-177">He's some kind of funny.</p>
<p id="p-178">Yeah, I've heard that.</p>
<p id="p-179">This is just really, this is slangy, slangy stuff here.</p>
<p id="p-180">Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-181">Or what's another example of a sentence?</p>
<p id="p-182">That was some argument they had.</p>
<p id="p-183">I hope they're okay now.</p>
<p id="p-184">And we really need to punch.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-185">And we really need to punch the sum.</p>
<p id="p-186">That was some argument they had.</p>
<p id="p-187">So this is very different from what we've been talking about, something, someone, somewhere, right?</p>
<p id="p-188">Very different.</p>
<p id="p-189">Right, Or that was some expensive gift he got me.</p>
<p id="p-190">So it's like if you were to rearrange that or say it in a different way, you could say like, oh, the gift he got me was really expensive.</p>
<p id="p-191">Or that argument they had was really intense.</p>
<p id="p-192">Or she's a really good singer.</p>
<p id="p-193">Right, But this is just a different way to do it.</p>
<p id="p-194">Lindsay, I think it's pretty fairly common.</p>
<p id="p-195">I think so too.</p>
<p id="p-196">Yeah, I think it emphasizes it's a way to show your personality using some.</p>
<p id="p-197">Usually we just use some in a very broad, general, kind of boring way.</p>
<p id="p-198">But you can have some fun here, right?</p>
<p id="p-199">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-200">Some fun.</p>
<p id="p-201">Let's do a couple of conversation questions while we have time.</p>
<p id="p-202">Lindsay, where would you like to live someday?</p>
<p id="p-203">Wow, someday I would love to live</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-204">love to live maybe in someplace warm, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-205">I don't know, maybe New Zealand or Australia or something.</p>
<p id="p-206">It'd be very exotic for me.</p>
<p id="p-207">I think I would like to live, yeah, maybe a warmer city.</p>
<p id="p-208">A warmer city, I know.</p>
<p id="p-209">I really feel like I could give up winter at this point.</p>
<p id="p-210">That's what my partner always says too.</p>
<p id="p-211">Like, we could just maybe not have winter anymore.</p>
<p id="p-212">I know about that.</p>
<p id="p-213">But you and the skiing, you gotta have winter.</p>
<p id="p-214">I know, but you know what?</p>
<p id="p-215">I don't think I love skiing enough to really not give it up.</p>
<p id="p-216">I think I could give it up.</p>
<p id="p-217">I love to ski because I live here and that's what people do and I'm good at it and I'll do it.</p>
<p id="p-218">It's a good way to spend the day, get outdoors, but I could live without it.</p>
<p id="p-219">Okay, okay, good to know, good to know.</p>
<p id="p-220">Who is someone special you keep in touch with from your childhood?</p>
<p id="p-221">So this is interesting though, because I am</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-222">This is interesting, though, because now I am using it in more of a noncommittal way, right?</p>
<p id="p-223">It could be like anyone, right?</p>
<p id="p-224">And that's a whole other topic.</p>
<p id="p-225">It can be kind of either.</p>
<p id="p-226">It's just interesting however you use it.</p>
<p id="p-227">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-228">Yeah, I'm not really in touch with any teachers.</p>
<p id="p-229">Some people will keep in touch with their second grade teacher or middle school teacher.</p>
<p id="p-230">I'm not.</p>
<p id="p-231">But maybe my best friend from middle school, and she was actually in my wedding, which is very cool.</p>
<p id="p-232">So, yeah, I'd say that was someone that's someone who has been special to me.</p>
<p id="p-233">Yeah, Yeah, that's very nice.</p>
<p id="p-234">Yeah, I keep in touch with actually I just saw my phone is sitting over here and I just saw that I got a missed call from someone special from my childhood.</p>
<p id="p-235">One of my two best friends from childhood.</p>
<p id="p-236">So that's nice.</p>
<p id="p-237">I have to give her a call later.</p>
<p id="p-238">Should we do a role play?</p>
<p id="p-239">Yeah, let's do it, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-240">So here we are about to see a movie.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-241">Here, we are about to see a movie together.</p>
<p id="p-242">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-243">Okay, should we get something to snack on during the movie?</p>
<p id="p-244">Sure, popcorn?</p>
<p id="p-245">Oh yeah, let's do it.</p>
<p id="p-246">This place has some good popcorn.</p>
<p id="p-247">It's the best movie theater popcorn I've ever had.</p>
<p id="p-248">I can't wait to try it.</p>
<p id="p-249">Oh, remind me, I want to introduce you to someone.</p>
<p id="p-250">My friend Larry says his daughter knows you from law school.</p>
<p id="p-251">Oh, do you know her name?</p>
<p id="p-252">He told me, but somehow I can't remember.</p>
<p id="p-253">Okay, text it to me sometime when you remember.</p>
<p id="p-254">What's the actor in this movie's name?</p>
<p id="p-255">Paul something?</p>
<p id="p-256">Oh, Paul Rudd.</p>
<p id="p-257">Oh, I love him.</p>
<p id="p-258">I have to tell you about this new book I read at some point, also.</p>
<p id="p-259">Okay, nice.</p>
<p id="p-260">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-261">Some is coming in here, and that wouldn't be uncommon to see some entering the conversation in all these iterations, right?</p>
<p id="p-262">It's just so common.</p>
<p id="p-263">I mean, it's just like everywhere.</p>
<p id="p-264">Yeah, it's everywhere.</p>
<p id="p-265">So I said, should we get something to snack on during the movie?</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-266">snack on during the movie.</p>
<p id="p-267">Perfect.</p>
<p id="p-268">All right.</p>
<p id="p-269">And then you said, yes, let's do it, right?</p>
<p id="p-270">This place has some good popcorn.</p>
<p id="p-271">And this is this way of expressing our personalities, really emphasizing it has great popcorn.</p>
<p id="p-272">It has some good popcorn.</p>
<p id="p-273">All right.</p>
<p id="p-274">And then you said, oh, remind me, I want to introduce you to someone.</p>
<p id="p-275">So this is a specific person.</p>
<p id="p-276">So interesting.</p>
<p id="p-277">Yeah, interesting.</p>
<p id="p-278">And then you said, do you know her name?</p>
<p id="p-279">And I said, he told me, somehow I can't remember.</p>
<p id="p-280">Yeah, And then I said, okay, text it to me sometime when you remember.</p>
<p id="p-281">Good.</p>
<p id="p-282">And then you said, what's the actor's name in this movie?</p>
<p id="p-283">And I said, oh, Paul something.</p>
<p id="p-284">And this is a common way when we can't come up with someone's last name.</p>
<p id="p-285">Usually it's actually for people we know, right?</p>
<p id="p-286">Mike something, do you know him?</p>
<p id="p-287">He was at the party last week.</p>
<p id="p-288">But I guess you could use it for famous actors too, right?</p>
<p id="p-289">Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-290">Sure.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-291">Right?</p>
<p id="p-292">Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Sure.</p>
<p id="p-293">Paul Rudd, who it's funny because we were talking about Clueless and that he's in Clueless.</p>
<p id="p-294">I think he's that.</p>
<p id="p-295">What is it?</p>
<p id="p-296">People say that he's aging like incredibly well.</p>
<p id="p-297">Or was that him or someone else?</p>
<p id="p-298">Yeah, it's him.</p>
<p id="p-299">They say he's like aging backwards.</p>
<p id="p-300">Reverse aging or something.</p>
<p id="p-301">Benjamin Button action going on.</p>
<p id="p-302">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-303">He's Benjamin Buttoning.</p>
<p id="p-304">No.</p>
<p id="p-305">Oh, he's gorgeous.</p>
<p id="p-306">I have such a crush on him.</p>
<p id="p-307">He looks just as good now as he did in Clueless.</p>
<p id="p-308">I mean, that was 20 years ago.</p>
<p id="p-309">He's adorable.</p>
<p id="p-310">Anyway, now you guys know one of my celebrity crushes.</p>
<p id="p-311">I have a crush on him, too.</p>
<p id="p-312">It's okay.</p>
<p id="p-313">He's adorable.</p>
