<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-22">That's allearsenglish.com slash B-U-S-I-N-E-S-S. Hey, Lindsay, how are you?</p>
<p id="p-23">Good, Michelle, how are you?</p>
<p id="p-24">How's it going?</p>
<p id="p-25">I'm good.</p>
<p id="p-26">I don't think I wished you a Happy New Year yet.</p>
<p id="p-27">Oh, Happy New Year in that case, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-28">Glad to be here.</p>
<p id="p-29">So exciting.</p>
<p id="p-30">Oh my gosh, it's going to be a good year, I think.</p>
<p id="p-31">Yes, Lindsay, when was the last time you went to the dentist?</p>
<p id="p-32">Well, funny you ask, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-33">I actually just went yesterday.</p>
<p id="p-34">I'm glad that I have a good answer for that instead of like five years ago.</p>
<p id="p-35">That's right.</p>
<p id="p-36">I went yesterday.</p>
<p id="p-37">You're very responsible.</p>
<p id="p-38">Yep, feeling good about that.</p>
<p id="p-39">So yeah, yeah, I try to go three times a year, usually.</p>
<p id="p-40">Three?</p>
<p id="p-41">That's good.</p>
<p id="p-42">Wow, that's a lot.</p>
<p id="p-43">Yes, a little extra cleaning never hurt, you know?</p>
<p id="p-44">So you're not afraid of the dentist, are you?</p>
<p id="p-45">I don't love it because usually, you know, when they clean your teeth, it hits nerves and stuff, so that can be a little painful.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-46">So that can be a little painful, but I know that it's good for me to go, so I go.</p>
<p id="p-47">And I don't have to get teeth pulled or anything when I go, thank goodness, right?</p>
<p id="p-48">And that's what we're talking about today, is a fun little expression.</p>
<p id="p-49">I love when we teach our listeners these super native, natural expressions, because it gives them like a quick, it's like a secret.</p>
<p id="p-50">They can put in their back pocket and pull these out anytime they want to sound natural.</p>
<p id="p-51">And what is the expression though, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-52">All right, so the expression is, it's like pulling teeth.</p>
<p id="p-53">Yes, This is, I mean, this is a super, this is an old school one, right?</p>
<p id="p-54">It's cheesy, but would you say it's still common?</p>
<p id="p-55">Yeah, I use this.</p>
<p id="p-56">I like this one.</p>
<p id="p-57">This is part of my repertoire, my personal repertoire.</p>
<p id="p-58">It's fun.</p>
<p id="p-59">It's descriptive.</p>
<p id="p-60">Yeah, I think it's good.</p>
<p id="p-61">I endorse this, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-62">You endorse, very good.</p>
<p id="p-63">So yeah, so basically this means that something is very difficult to do.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-64">Pulling is very difficult to do.</p>
<p id="p-65">That's what it means.</p>
<p id="p-66">But it is funny because so my husband is a dentist and he always talks about this expression because he always says, for a dentist, it's not that hard to pull a tooth.</p>
<p id="p-67">So he's like, who is the expression talking about?</p>
<p id="p-68">Is it for the person getting their teeth pulled?</p>
<p id="p-69">Because if it's from the dentist perspective, like that's actually not that difficult.</p>
<p id="p-70">That's a good point.</p>
<p id="p-71">He's really overthinking that, I think, a little bit.</p>
<p id="p-72">Definitely.</p>
<p id="p-73">Yeah, That's where this idea came from because we were having this talk about that.</p>
<p id="p-74">And he's like, I don't understand who this expression is meant for.</p>
<p id="p-75">Pulling teeth for a dentist, like that's what we're trained to do.</p>
<p id="p-76">That's not that hard.</p>
<p id="p-77">That's like... Oh, that's funny.</p>
<p id="p-78">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-79">My mind, it's for, it's more from the perspective of the person whose teeth are being pulled.</p>
<p id="p-80">You think so?</p>
<p id="p-81">I think so, because think about how painful.</p>
<p id="p-82">I mean, now we have Novocaine, obviously we have all the drugs and all the things, but I'm sure there was a time</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-83">but I'm sure there was a time, you know, hundreds of years ago when they just yanked your tooth out.</p>
<p id="p-84">True.</p>
<p id="p-85">But if it was from the perspective of the person getting their teeth pulled, wouldn't it be, it's like having your teeth pulled, right?</p>
<p id="p-86">So I always thought of it as like the dentist's perspective, but yeah, then from, I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-87">I think we're thinking too much into this.</p>
<p id="p-88">Basically, guys, this means something is difficult to do.</p>
<p id="p-89">Yeah, I love this.</p>

<p id="p-96">Yes, and you know what's funny is that right now, right in front of me, I just realized that there is on the windowsill,</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-97">on the windowsill, a giant crocheted tooth with eyes and a mouth.</p>
<p id="p-98">Because I always have all this random... Yeah, I have all this random... And so now I'm just looking at it like, hello.</p>
<p id="p-99">And it's like, don't pull me.</p>
<p id="p-100">Yeah, don't pull me.</p>
<p id="p-101">Oh my gosh, that's funny.</p>
<p id="p-102">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-103">When I think about this expression, though, I think about this first example we have for our listeners, which is trying to get my kids to tell me about their days is like pulling teeth.</p>
<p id="p-104">So I do think about kids just not wanting to do something or talk or share.</p>
<p id="p-105">And it's like pulling teeth.</p>
<p id="p-106">I feel like that's where it comes up the most.</p>
<p id="p-107">Don't you think?</p>
<p id="p-108">Yeah, I would say.</p>
<p id="p-109">I mean, even it's funny with my son, when he gets off the bus, first of all, he's the most loving boy in the whole world.</p>
<p id="p-110">Like, unbelievable.</p>
<p id="p-111">He's so loving.</p>
<p id="p-112">But when he gets off the bus, he barely acknowledges my existence.</p>
<p id="p-113">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-114">Yeah, And then I don't even really bother asking him any questions.</p>
<p id="p-115">I just kind of wait for things to come out naturally.</p>
<p id="p-116">And then, you know, when I come...</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-117">things to come out naturally.</p>
<p id="p-118">And then, you know, when it comes, when everything comes out at lying down at night.</p>
<p id="p-119">So, you know, you just kind of have to wait at Noah as a parent, you know, when are you, when should you ask and how should you ask?</p>
<p id="p-120">And because all you want to do is know everything.</p>
<p id="p-121">I wish I could know everything about your day.</p>
<p id="p-122">You want to know it all.</p>
<p id="p-123">So you have to back off and not pull the teeth, right?</p>
<p id="p-124">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-125">You have to play it cool.</p>
<p id="p-126">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-127">Play it cool.</p>
<p id="p-128">Here's another example.</p>
<p id="p-129">Getting my bandmates to practice every day is like pulling teeth.</p>
<p id="p-130">So they clearly they don't want to practice.</p>
<p id="p-131">Maybe they're lazy or they're just busy or something.</p>
<p id="p-132">So it's very hard.</p>
<p id="p-133">So you're always nagging them to practice.</p>
<p id="p-134">That word nag is a good one.</p>
<p id="p-135">Nag, yes.</p>
<p id="p-136">Or finding the right holiday gifts for my friends is like pulling teeth.</p>
<p id="p-137">So they're hard to shop for.</p>
<p id="p-138">Lindsay, are you good at knowing what gifts to get people?</p>
<p id="p-139">No, I'm really bad at that.</p>
<p id="p-140">And I also leave things to the last minute.</p>
<p id="p-141">I leave things to the last minute and then I panic and then...</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-142">And then I panic and then it just never turns out well, so I've got to get started early this year.</p>
<p id="p-143">We're recording this in early December, so there's still a chance.</p>
<p id="p-144">There's still time, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-145">So, yeah, but this is about, it's basically about an effort that you have to put in, something, maybe trying to get someone to do something or say something.</p>
<p id="p-146">So, like an extraction of some sort for the most part.</p>
<p id="p-147">You're trying to get something from somebody, so pulling teeth.</p>
<p id="p-148">That's a good description.</p>
<p id="p-149">That's why I always think of like trying to get your kids to tell you something or share something or take out the garbage or something, right?</p>
<p id="p-150">Yeah, It's like pulling teeth.</p>
<p id="p-151">Would you say there's anything in your life that comes to mind that's like pulling teeth?</p>
<p id="p-152">I think, geez, I can't think of anything right.</p>
<p id="p-153">I guess getting myself to do my chores, you know, sometimes I just don't feel like vacuuming on a Sunday or cleaning.</p>
<p id="p-154">That can be like pulling teeth.</p>
<p id="p-155">That's an interesting use of it, right?</p>
<p id="p-156">On yourself.</p>
<p id="p-157">It's not.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-158">use of it right on yourself.</p>
<p id="p-159">It's not how we use it, but it's my own.</p>
<p id="p-160">Yeah, but English is like that.</p>
<p id="p-161">You can play with the language.</p>
<p id="p-162">So for me, I'm going to call out my brother.</p>
<p id="p-163">I mean, getting my brother to answer a question about planning, and he's notorious for this.</p>
<p id="p-164">I mean, my dad will ask him questions, and then we can't get an answer.</p>
<p id="p-165">And oh, he's very wait until the last minute.</p>
<p id="p-166">And I am in a sense, but he is to the extreme.</p>
<p id="p-167">So if you try and ask him, like we were trying to plan my dad's birthday, and I was going to sing a song with my sister-in-law, and he was going to play piano.</p>
<p id="p-168">How did that turn out?</p>
<p id="p-169">Did you end up doing it?</p>
<p id="p-170">It was good, but it was two days before, and I finally got him on the phone.</p>
<p id="p-171">And he's like, oh, I said, maybe we can just talk about which part my sister-in-law and I are singing.</p>
<p id="p-172">And he's like, I don't think it needs to be that serious.</p>
<p id="p-173">And I'm like, I think this is a normal</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-174">I think this is a normal conversation.</p>
<p id="p-175">Who's singing what?</p>
<p id="p-176">Yeah, you just want a plan.</p>
<p id="p-177">So he's not a planner, it sounds like.</p>
<p id="p-178">No, to the extreme.</p>
<p id="p-179">But yeah, so I would say that's like pulling teeth.</p>
<p id="p-180">But we talked about this a little bit.</p>
<p id="p-181">So you don't seem, it doesn't sound like you think this is outdated, this expression.</p>
<p id="p-182">No, I'm not too worried about that.</p>
<p id="p-183">No, I still use it.</p>
<p id="p-184">Maybe I'm outdated.</p>
<p id="p-185">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-186">No, I don't think it is.</p>
<p id="p-187">It's, you know, because we talk sometimes about like, oh, raining cats and dogs and those kinds of idioms.</p>
<p id="p-188">That one is pretty outdated, I think.</p>
<p id="p-189">Right, And it's funny because this one seems to kind of hold up because it's still, I don't know when it started being used, but it's still kind of stood the test of time, I think.</p>
<p id="p-190">I think so.</p>
<p id="p-191">And I think it's a good connection phrase.</p>
<p id="p-192">I mean, why do you think it would be good for connection, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-193">Because you're talking about your struggles.</p>
<p id="p-194">It's good for relating to people.</p>
<p id="p-195">Oh, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-196">Trying to get my kids to do this.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-197">Trying to get my kids to do this is like pulling teeth.</p>
<p id="p-198">Oh, mine too.</p>
<p id="p-199">People can start to relate to you on things that are difficult for them.</p>
<p id="p-200">Yep, especially if you're at a similar life phase as someone else.</p>
<p id="p-201">Maybe you pick up your kids at daycare or something, and you're struggling with the same things.</p>
<p id="p-202">That is the recipe for building connection and friendships.</p>
<p id="p-203">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-204">All right, so there are other ways to say the same thing, which are very funny too.</p>
<p id="p-205">These are fun little idioms.</p>
<p id="p-206">For example, it's like herding cats.</p>
<p id="p-207">Have you heard that one?</p>
<p id="p-208">I've heard this one, of course.</p>
<p id="p-209">Yeah, and the idea here, I mean, why is this hard?</p>
<p id="p-210">Yeah, because the cats aren't going to... They can't be heard.</p>
<p id="p-211">Yeah, you can't herd them.</p>
<p id="p-212">You can't just say, oh, we're all going the same way, right?</p>
<p id="p-213">No, cows you can herd.</p>
<p id="p-214">Cows you can herd, but cats you can't. My dog is like a herding breed.</p>
<p id="p-215">He is a part border collie.</p>
<p id="p-216">And so it's like in his...</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-217">And so it's in his genes.</p>
<p id="p-218">He'll see a dog and he'll crouch and start to stalk it.</p>
<p id="p-219">But he doesn't want to hurt it.</p>
<p id="p-220">He wants to herd it.</p>
<p id="p-221">He doesn't want to hurt it.</p>
<p id="p-222">Ah, herd, not hurt.</p>
<p id="p-223">Yes, And then he'll do these spins and it's part of his herding routine.</p>
<p id="p-224">It's just really funny.</p>
<p id="p-225">That's cute.</p>
<p id="p-226">Dogs are so funny.</p>
<p id="p-227">I love him.</p>
<p id="p-228">That's really cute.</p>
<p id="p-229">What would be an example, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-230">All right, my life exactly.</p>
<p id="p-231">Trying to get my kids out the door in the morning is like herding cats.</p>
<p id="p-232">Yeah, because cats will run in all directions, right?</p>
<p id="p-233">That's what they'll do.</p>
<p id="p-234">They'll meow and run and hide and it's impossible, right?</p>
<p id="p-235">Yep, that's why we're always late.</p>
<p id="p-236">That's your reality.</p>
<p id="p-237">Yes, Next one.</p>
<p id="p-238">A hard nut to crack.</p>
<p id="p-239">So these are kind of related expressions.</p>
<p id="p-240">So that means something is difficult to solve or someone is difficult to get information out of.</p>
<p id="p-241">So similar idea, not exactly, but I want to know what's going on.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-242">I want to know what's going on in his head, but he's a hard nut to crack.</p>
<p id="p-243">So I could have said, but asking him questions or getting him to answer is like pulling teeth, right?</p>
<p id="p-244">So that's how they're kind of related.</p>
<p id="p-245">Yeah, they're related.</p>
<p id="p-246">Maybe the person's a bit of a mystery, an enigma, right?</p>
<p id="p-247">You just don't, can't quite figure the person out, right?</p>
<p id="p-248">This expression getting nowhere fast, you know, it's like spinning your wheels, right?</p>
<p id="p-249">Not progressing.</p>
<p id="p-250">I can tell this conversation is going nowhere fast.</p>
<p id="p-251">It's kind of a funny one.</p>
<p id="p-252">Yeah, that's a good one.</p>
<p id="p-253">So what else, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-254">The last one is just, you could say something is really tough.</p>
<p id="p-255">That's kind of the most basic way, but it's also good to use.</p>
<p id="p-256">So getting my teacher to help me more with this assignment is really tough, right?</p>
<p id="p-257">That's just kind of very neutral, not with any bells and whistle idioms on it, but very common.</p>
<p id="p-258">Yeah, sometimes we just want the most straightforward phrase, and that is an option for our listeners too.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-259">And that is an option for our listeners too.</p>
<p id="p-260">There's nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p id="p-261">We don't have to always come up with the fanciest idiom because remember guys, connection is the goal.</p>
<p id="p-262">So don't go off in la-la land trying to come up with the idiom.</p>
<p id="p-263">You want to connect, make the eye contact and say the direct phrase sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-264">Right, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-265">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-266">Kind of like the most basic one.</p>
<p id="p-267">So should we do a role play?</p>
<p id="p-268">Let's do it, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-269">So here we are both first grade teachers.</p>
<p id="p-270">Wow, I don't think I could do it.</p>
<p id="p-271">But we're friends and we work at the same school.</p>
<p id="p-272">All right, here we are.</p>
<p id="p-273">All right, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-274">So how's your class going?</p>
<p id="p-275">It's good, but trying to get them to leave for music class is like herding cats.</p>
<p id="p-276">Oh, tell me about it.</p>
<p id="p-277">They're so cute, but sometimes getting them to answer questions is like pulling teeth.</p>
<p id="p-278">Definitely, it can be really tough.</p>
<p id="p-279">Especially one boy in my class.</p>
<p id="p-280">He's a hard nut to crack.</p>
<p id="p-281">I'm not sure if he likes school.</p>
<p id="p-282">Oh, that's too bad.</p>
<p id="p-283">It can feel like you're getting nowhere fast, but we're still at the beginning.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-284">You're getting nowhere fast, but we're still at the beginning.</p>
<p id="p-285">That's true.</p>
<p id="p-286">Maybe it's the beginning of the school year or something, right?</p>
<p id="p-287">Which is what you mean there.</p>
<p id="p-288">So here we're talking about getting kids organized, getting them moving all in one direction, down to the music class, down the hallway, is like herding cats.</p>
<p id="p-289">Right, Because one kid has to go to the bathroom, the other kid has to get his lunch, and it's just chaos, I'm sure.</p>
<p id="p-290">And then I said, they're so cute, but sometimes getting them to answer questions is like pulling teeth.</p>
<p id="p-291">So maybe I'm sitting there and saying, oh, and who knows the answer to this?</p>
<p id="p-292">And no one says anything.</p>
<p id="p-293">Nothing.</p>
<p id="p-294">Silence.</p>
<p id="p-295">I mean, this can happen when you're teaching adult learners, too.</p>
<p id="p-296">I mean, I'm sure you've both been in the adult classroom, teaching adults ESL, and sometimes you ask a question, there's no response.</p>
<p id="p-297">There's silence.</p>
<p id="p-298">Yeah, 100%. And then you're like, okay, I'll just answer my own question.</p>
<p id="p-299">Right, Yes, And then we just went with a straightforward phrase.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-300">And we just went with a straightforward phrase here, right, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-301">So I said, definitely, can be really tough.</p>
<p id="p-302">And this is good for empathizing, right?</p>
<p id="p-303">We don't need, because I'm trying to reflect back what you said, so I don't necessarily need to come up with some fancy idiom here.</p>
<p id="p-304">I just need to know that I show that, yeah, that I get you.</p>
<p id="p-305">Right, because you didn't, right.</p>
<p id="p-306">I said one, so if then you just came back right away with another one, you know, because again, here you're just empathizing.</p>
<p id="p-307">So if I said getting them to answer questions is like pulling teeth, definitely, it can be like herding cats.</p>
<p id="p-308">You know, it might be like a little overkill.</p>
<p id="p-309">So it's good to have those more basic expressions just to insert when you need them.</p>
<p id="p-310">Yep, exactly, because again, the goal is connection.</p>
<p id="p-311">It's not being fancy with our vocabulary.</p>
<p id="p-312">It's not sounding like a genius.</p>
<p id="p-313">It's connecting, right?</p>
<p id="p-314">Love that.</p>
<p id="p-315">And what else, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-316">I said, especially one boy in my class.</p>
<p id="p-317">He's a hard nut to crack.</p>
<p id="p-318">I could have also said a tough nut to crack, I think.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-319">Not to crack, I think.</p>
<p id="p-320">Yeah, that's true.</p>
<p id="p-321">So I say both.</p>
<p id="p-322">Both.</p>
<p id="p-323">And then I said, I'm not sure if he likes school.</p>
<p id="p-324">Good.</p>
<p id="p-325">And then I said, that's too bad.</p>
<p id="p-326">It can feel like you're getting nowhere fast, but we're still at the beginning.</p>
<p id="p-327">So and that also I mentioned a bonus idiom, spinning our wheels, right?</p>
<p id="p-328">It's kind of similar idea.</p>
<p id="p-329">You feel like you're putting all this energy into something, but your wheels are just spinning.</p>
<p id="p-330">They're not going anywhere.</p>
<p id="p-331">Right, Great.</p>
<p id="p-332">This is a good one, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-333">What's another episode our listeners should check out?</p>
<p id="p-334">All right.</p>
<p id="p-335">Check out all ears English.</p>
<p id="p-336">This was another, I think, another Saturday one, although it could have been a Friday.</p>
<p id="p-337">Avoid mistakes with these English adjectives.</p>
<p id="p-338">Yeah, And what's our takeaway for today?</p>
<p id="p-339">Where should we leave our listeners?</p>
<p id="p-340">We've learned a lot of idioms today.</p>
<p id="p-341">Yeah, we got a lot here.</p>
<p id="p-342">Listen out for these.</p>
<p id="p-343">I taught you very common ones.</p>
<p id="p-344">We taught you very common ones.</p>
<p id="p-345">And, you know, these are just super good connection topics because they can always bring to the surface things that other people are</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p id="p-346">surface, things that other people are feeling or can get people to tell a story, share something about their life.</p>
<p id="p-347">So very, very useful for connection.</p>
<p id="p-348">Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-349">If you can show in a kind of a lighthearted way with an idiom that maybe you're struggling with something, right?</p>
<p id="p-350">You're struggling to talk to your child or struggling to do something that kind of that opens up, like you said, Michelle, that space for connection.</p>
<p id="p-351">So these are the phrases to do it.</p>
<p id="p-352">All right.</p>
<p id="p-353">Excellent.</p>
<p id="p-354">Good.</p>
<p id="p-355">All right.</p>
<p id="p-356">Well, this was fun, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-357">All right.</p>
<p id="p-358">Great stuff, Michelle.</p>
