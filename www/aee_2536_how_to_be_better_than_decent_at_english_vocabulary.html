<p id="p-16">Hey, Aubrey, how are you?</p>
<p id="p-17">Hello, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-18">How are you?</p>
<p id="p-19">I'm excited to record with you.</p>
<p id="p-20">Me too, guys.</p>
<p id="p-21">Aubrey and I are recording together today.</p>
<p id="p-22">Lindsay will be back, but Aubrey and I are getting the chance to record a bit.</p>
<p id="p-23">So very excited about that.</p>
<p id="p-24">But Aubrey, I have a question for you.</p>
<p id="p-25">What is the last movie you saw in the theater?</p>
<p id="p-26">Oh, Wicked Part 2.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-27">Wicked, part two, Wicked for Good.</p>
<p id="p-28">We took all of our kids yesterday and saw it in the theater.</p>
<p id="p-29">I almost did that yesterday, but then everyone was too crazy.</p>
<p id="p-30">But how was it?</p>
<p id="p-31">Did you like it?</p>
<p id="p-32">It was decent.</p>
<p id="p-33">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-34">I wrote this role play for us so I could use decent, but that's not actually how I feel.</p>
<p id="p-35">I really loved it.</p>
<p id="p-36">Did you?</p>
<p id="p-37">I love Wicked on Broadway, and I've loved these film adaptations.</p>
<p id="p-38">I like musicals, though.</p>
<p id="p-39">I know they're not for everyone.</p>
<p id="p-40">But I really loved it, and Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande both just have amazing voices.</p>
<p id="p-41">I was really blown away by that.</p>
<p id="p-42">The songs and how their voices blend and just the beautiful notes.</p>
<p id="p-43">Yeah, I'm excited to see it.</p>
<p id="p-44">It's not as long as the first one, right?</p>
<p id="p-45">Right, It felt very quick.</p>
<p id="p-46">Okay, that's good.</p>
<p id="p-47">But yeah, I guess you're probably used to the first one where you basically have to spend the whole day.</p>
<p id="p-48">They have an intermission built in.</p>
<p id="p-49">It was long.</p>
<p id="p-50">Okay, good.</p>
<p id="p-51">I have to...</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-52">Okay, good.</p>
<p id="p-53">Yeah, my son has been asking to see it.</p>
<p id="p-54">Maybe I'll have to surprise him and take him.</p>
<p id="p-55">He'll like it.</p>
<p id="p-56">So this is interesting.</p>
<p id="p-57">We're talking about the word decent today.</p>
<p id="p-58">This was inspired by a mistake we've heard students make where they use the adjective decent to mean good or really good.</p>
<p id="p-59">Like maybe they would describe a movie and say it was a fantastic, decent film.</p>
<p id="p-60">And I can really see why if you just look at the dictionary definition, I can see why this mistake is made.</p>
<p id="p-61">Because, you know, decent has so many meanings and the definition says of an acceptable standard, satisfactory.</p>
<p id="p-62">And I could see students thinking that means good, right?</p>
<p id="p-63">But it doesn't really.</p>
<p id="p-64">It's interesting.</p>
<p id="p-65">Yeah, that is very interesting.</p>
<p id="p-66">Yeah, this makes me think of my dad.</p>
<p id="p-67">My dad to this day always says, oh, was it decent?</p>
<p id="p-68">Like if you say, oh, I had this</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-69">I went to this restaurant.</p>
<p id="p-70">Oh, was it decent?</p>
<p id="p-71">Or even in our videos from childhood of vacations.</p>
<p id="p-72">Oh, Michelle, how was it?</p>
<p id="p-73">It was a decent?</p>
<p id="p-74">That's so interesting.</p>
<p id="p-75">He sort of has a low bar.</p>
<p id="p-76">He's not asking if it was good.</p>
<p id="p-77">Like decent meaning like, was it acceptable?</p>
<p id="p-78">Right, acceptable, satisfactory.</p>
<p id="p-79">Good enough.</p>
<p id="p-80">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-81">So I just think when I hear the word decent, I think of my dad.</p>
<p id="p-82">But my dad is not just decent.</p>
<p id="p-83">My dad is wonderful.</p>
<p id="p-84">This is interesting.</p>
<p id="p-85">You don't want to accidentally describe something as decent if you mean it's really good, right?</p>
<p id="p-86">There's definitely a negative collocation to this.</p>
<p id="p-87">That if you're calling something decent, you actually mean it wasn't that great.</p>
<p id="p-88">It's fine.</p>
<p id="p-89">It just passes, right?</p>
<p id="p-90">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-91">But that's not the only meaning for decent.</p>
<p id="p-92">There are four different meanings.</p>
<p id="p-93">So we're going to share all of them today with examples.</p>
<p id="p-94">But guys, if you're not hitting follow on the All Ears English podcast, you are missing lots</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>

<p id="p-100">Yes, it's fun to watch these episodes as a video.</p>
<p id="p-101">So go check it out on YouTube.</p>
<p id="p-102">Definitely.</p>
<p id="p-103">So let's dive in.</p>
<p id="p-104">Yeah, the many definitions.</p>
<p id="p-105">So number one is kind of this one that we've already been discussing, right?</p>
<p id="p-106">I'll read this.</p>
<p id="p-107">Good enough or acceptable.</p>
<p id="p-108">Not amazing.</p>
<p id="p-109">I like this, but meets minimum expectations.</p>
<p id="p-110">Yeah, And I've definitely seen some films that I would describe as decent or right.</p>
<p id="p-111">If something I'm like, it was all right.</p>
<p id="p-112">I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone.</p>
<p id="p-113">Then I would describe it as decent.</p>
<p id="p-114">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-115">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-116">So for example, the restaurant wasn't fancy, but the food was decent.</p>
<p id="p-117">Yeah, this is interesting.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-118">Yeah, this is interesting.</p>
<p id="p-119">You're not saying it was amazing, and you'd give five stars, recommend it to everyone, but it wasn't terrible.</p>
<p id="p-120">The food was decent.</p>
<p id="p-121">Or I got a decent score on the exam.</p>
<p id="p-122">Not great, but not bad either.</p>
<p id="p-123">You probably passed if you're saying your score was decent, but it certainly wasn't like 100%. Yes, yes.</p>
<p id="p-124">So yeah, this is a really useful definition of this word.</p>
<p id="p-125">And just so our listeners know, decent is spelled D-E-C-E-N-T. So good to know.</p>
<p id="p-126">And this is tricky because if you add an S, we have the word descent, which is pronounced differently, spelled slightly differently.</p>
<p id="p-127">I could see that confusing people, but yes, this has a different meaning.</p>
<p id="p-128">That's if you have the C, right?</p>
<p id="p-129">D-E, right?</p>
<p id="p-130">That's descent.</p>
<p id="p-131">So the second one, let's get into it, is respectable or reliable.</p>
<p id="p-132">So honest, moral, having integrity.</p>
<p id="p-133">And we use this a lot to describe people</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-134">We use this a lot to describe people who have good character.</p>
<p id="p-135">Yeah, and it is a more positive connotation here.</p>
<p id="p-136">If you say, for example, he seems like a decent guy, it's like, I'm not saying he's just barely passable, like this means he's a good person.</p>
<p id="p-137">He's reliable, honest, has integrity.</p>
<p id="p-138">So it's really strange.</p>
<p id="p-139">I can see this being what the other reason students are maybe using decent incorrectly as an adjective to describe like a film, because when we use it to describe a person, it's very positive.</p>
<p id="p-140">If someone's decent, they're like, they have high morals, you know, the good integrity, right?</p>
<p id="p-141">Or she helped her elderly neighbor with his yard work, which was a really decent thing to do.</p>
<p id="p-142">Yeah, it was like kind, right?</p>
<p id="p-143">Thoughtful.</p>
<p id="p-144">So yeah, really interesting how different those definitions are.</p>
<p id="p-145">Or our third means like proper or appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-146">Often this is about...</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-147">Often this is about modesty or it might mean presentable or appropriately dressed, right?</p>
<p id="p-148">Uh-huh.</p>
<p id="p-149">Yeah, you could say, don't come in, I'm not decent, right?</p>
<p id="p-150">So you might not even be wearing clothes, not have any clothes on, right?</p>
<p id="p-151">Or if somebody knocks on the door, they might say, are you decent?</p>
<p id="p-152">Like, can I come in?</p>
<p id="p-153">Right, And often that means, are you clothed at all?</p>
<p id="p-154">But then we'll also use this to mean I'm not dressed appropriately, right?</p>
<p id="p-155">If you're like in sweats and you need to go outside, you'd be like, let me put something on, I'm not decent.</p>
<p id="p-156">It just means like I'm not dressed to go out.</p>
<p id="p-157">Right, right, right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-158">And then let's get into the last one we're going to share is fairly large or a respectable amount.</p>
<p id="p-159">So this is used to describe an amount or quantity that is not small.</p>
<p id="p-160">Such a different meaning.</p>
<p id="p-161">It's so strange that we have the exact same word to mean this.</p>
<p id="p-162">Why couldn't we come up with another word?</p>
<p id="p-163">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-164">That's really weird.</p>
<p id="p-165">So for example,</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-166">So for example, we had a decent number of people show up to the event.</p>
<p id="p-167">So this means like, it was quite a few, right?</p>
<p id="p-168">It wasn't like, nobody showed up, we were really disappointed by the numbers.</p>
<p id="p-169">We would use this to mean like, yeah, it was a decent number.</p>
<p id="p-170">Like there, you know, this was not small, not just a few people.</p>
<p id="p-171">Or they drove a decent distance before stopping.</p>
<p id="p-172">Which would mean quite a bit, right?</p>
<p id="p-173">Yeah, yeah, pretty.</p>
<p id="p-174">Yeah, like a good portion.</p>
<p id="p-175">Several hours maybe.</p>
<p id="p-176">I wouldn't go 30 minutes and be like, I drove a decent distance if I have like a 15 hour drive in front of me.</p>
<p id="p-177">No.</p>
<p id="p-178">Right, although it is relative.</p>
<p id="p-179">Like let's say your child is learning to drive.</p>
<p id="p-180">And you know, for them, 30 minutes, it's like, okay, yeah, you drove a decent amount.</p>
<p id="p-181">Right, they're practicing.</p>
<p id="p-182">That'd be a lot for them.</p>
<p id="p-183">Good point.</p>
<p id="p-184">Yeah, So it's interesting how this will, like your...</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-185">how your tone will change this a little bit, whether it's positive or negative.</p>
<p id="p-186">Because imagine with this first one, if you were expecting thousands of people, it's like a fundraiser event, and maybe half the amount come that you want.</p>
<p id="p-187">If you're like, yeah, we had a decent number.</p>
<p id="p-188">And it's not that positive.</p>
<p id="p-189">My tone kind of indicates that like, you know, there were quite a few people, but like I would have preferred more.</p>
<p id="p-190">Yes, that's really interesting.</p>
<p id="p-191">But if you said, if you did have a lot show up, you could say, oh, we had a decent number of people show up to the event.</p>
<p id="p-192">So that's a different tone.</p>
<p id="p-193">And it sounds like you were happy about the number.</p>
<p id="p-194">So that's really, I like this topic.</p>
<p id="p-195">Aubrey, this is a good one.</p>
<p id="p-196">I'm glad we're talking about this.</p>

<p id="p-199">You are picking me up to give me a ride to the airport in this roleplay.</p>
<p id="p-200">Thank you, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-201">So kind of you.</p>
<p id="p-202">You are very welcome.</p>
<p id="p-203">I am not letting you spend money on an Uber.</p>
<p id="p-204">No, right?</p>
<p id="p-205">Such a good friend, especially if it's early in the morning.</p>
<p id="p-206">I've done this.</p>
<p id="p-207">I've offered a ride and they're like, okay, we need to leave at four.</p>
<p id="p-208">I'm like, if I had known that, maybe I wouldn't have offered.</p>
<p id="p-209">It's hilarious.</p>
<p id="p-210">Okay, let's start here.</p>
<p id="p-211">I'll start us out.</p>
<p id="p-212">Oh, I like your jacket.</p>
<p id="p-213">Thanks.</p>
<p id="p-214">I got it on sale for a decent price too.</p>
<p id="p-215">Amazing.</p>
<p id="p-216">You've always been good at finding a deal.</p>
<p id="p-217">Thanks for picking me up, by the way.</p>
<p id="p-218">That was really decent of you.</p>
<p id="p-219">No problem.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-220">No problem.</p>
<p id="p-221">Are you ready?</p>
<p id="p-222">Just need to change so I look decent.</p>
<p id="p-223">I spilled coffee on this shirt a minute ago.</p>
<p id="p-224">Oh, gotcha.</p>
<p id="p-225">Hurry though.</p>
<p id="p-226">It's a decent drive to the airport from here.</p>
<p id="p-227">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-228">And it's so interesting how it doesn't even sound strange to use decent so many times in this one conversation because there's all these different meanings.</p>
<p id="p-229">It's weird that it's even the same word.</p>
<p id="p-230">Right, that's true.</p>
<p id="p-231">I don't know that I would do it that many times.</p>
<p id="p-232">It has different definitions.</p>
<p id="p-233">These are all different contexts.</p>
<p id="p-234">But yeah, I still think we would want to vary what we say.</p>
<p id="p-235">That's true, right?</p>
<p id="p-236">We're using them on purpose in this roleplay, but if I had just said, so I look decent, you'd probably say, oh, it's a long drive to the airport, so let's go.</p>
<p id="p-237">You probably wouldn't say it's a decent drive.</p>
<p id="p-238">Right, it just might be a little overkill, but you are right that they have different, totally different definitions.</p>
<p id="p-239">So let's go through it here.</p>
<p id="p-240">You first said, I'm saying I like your jacket.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-241">I like your jacket.</p>
<p id="p-242">Say, I got it on sale for a decent price.</p>
<p id="p-243">So this is like, you know, good enough, acceptable.</p>
<p id="p-244">Fair.</p>
<p id="p-245">It wasn't the highest price.</p>
<p id="p-246">A fair price.</p>
<p id="p-247">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-248">And then you said, thanks for picking me up, by the way.</p>
<p id="p-249">That was really decent of you.</p>
<p id="p-250">So showing my good character.</p>
<p id="p-251">I'm very nice.</p>
<p id="p-252">What can I tell you?</p>
<p id="p-253">Yes, right?</p>
<p id="p-254">Thoughtful, kind.</p>
<p id="p-255">That was really decent of you.</p>
<p id="p-256">And this is interesting.</p>
<p id="p-257">I likely would say to a friend instead, like thoughtful, kind, one of these words.</p>
<p id="p-258">Decent does mean this.</p>
<p id="p-259">We might use this more often.</p>
<p id="p-260">The example about helping like an elderly neighbor with the landscaping.</p>
<p id="p-261">This kind of thing where we're thinking of it more as going above and beyond, right?</p>
<p id="p-262">Then we'd maybe say like, oh, he's such a decent guy.</p>
<p id="p-263">He's always just doing really decent things.</p>
<p id="p-264">Right, right.</p>
<p id="p-265">I'm imagining almost you're talking to somebody, you want to set them up on a date with somebody.</p>
<p id="p-266">And you could say like, he's really decent.</p>
<p id="p-267">Like he's, you know.</p>
<p id="p-268">Right, describing their character.</p>
<p id="p-269">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-270">Yeah, that's how I would imagine it.</p>
<p id="p-271">And then I like this, just need to change so I look decent.</p>
<p id="p-272">I spilled coffee on this shirt a minute ago, right?</p>
<p id="p-273">So you're saying so I looked acceptable even to go to the airport, or you don't want to be having coffee all over yourself.</p>
<p id="p-274">Right, that is like if you've got this shirt stained with coffee, you'd be like, oh, I don't look decent.</p>
<p id="p-275">Because it means not just like clothed at all, but also like appropriate for the occasion, clean clothing, right?</p>
<p id="p-276">Right, and I think, I actually think that that's kind of the distinction here, right?</p>
<p id="p-277">If you say, I'm not decent, right?</p>
<p id="p-278">That almost sounds like you're not wearing clothes.</p>
<p id="p-279">But if you're talking about so I look decent, to look decent is different than to be decent.</p>
<p id="p-280">That's a good point, right?</p>
<p id="p-281">When it's collocated with look, you're talking more about like my clothing isn't appropriate or it's not clean if I don't look decent.</p>
<p id="p-282">Or maybe I haven't done my hair and my makeup, I don't look decent, don't take a photograph of me.</p>
<p id="p-283">But then that chunk of I'm not</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-284">that chunk of I'm not decent.</p>
<p id="p-285">That might mean I'm not dressed at all.</p>
<p id="p-286">Like, don't come in.</p>
<p id="p-287">I'm not decent might mean I just got out of the shower.</p>
<p id="p-288">I'm not dressed at all.</p>
<p id="p-289">Right, right.</p>
<p id="p-290">I'm in my towel or whatever, you know.</p>
<p id="p-291">Yeah, and then the last one, you said, it's a decent drive to the airport, which would mean it's pretty far.</p>
<p id="p-292">Yep, pretty far.</p>
<p id="p-293">Yeah, oh my gosh, this is a very interesting word and I'm still thinking of my dad this whole episode.</p>
<p id="p-294">Dad, this one goes out to you.</p>
<p id="p-295">Nice, I love that.</p>
<p id="p-296">I can see how this really could cause a misunderstanding, but if you describe something as decent when you mean it was fantastic, it was really good, but I can definitely see how that's confusing because when you're describing a person as fantastic in that they have good moral character, we do use decent.</p>
<p id="p-297">So I'm glad we were able to dive into these details.</p>
<p id="p-298">Right, and also, you know, as part of the takeaway, you also want to think about the tone of voice.</p>
