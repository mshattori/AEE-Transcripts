<p>Hey, Aubrey, how are you?</p>
<p>Hello, Michelle.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>I'm excited to record with you.</p>
<p>Me too, guys.</p>
<p>Aubrey and I are recording together today.</p>
<p>Lindsay will be back, but Aubrey and I are getting the chance to record a bit.</p>
<p>So very excited about that.</p>
<p>But Aubrey, I have a question for you.</p>
<p>What is the last movie you saw in the theater?</p>
<p>Oh, Wicked Part 2.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>Wicked, part two, Wicked for Good.</p>
<p>We took all of our kids yesterday and saw it in the theater.</p>
<p>I almost did that yesterday, but then everyone was too crazy.</p>
<p>But how was it?</p>
<p>Did you like it?</p>
<p>It was decent.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I wrote this role play for us so I could use decent, but that's not actually how I feel.</p>
<p>I really loved it.</p>
<p>Did you?</p>
<p>I love Wicked on Broadway, and I've loved these film adaptations.</p>
<p>I like musicals, though.</p>
<p>I know they're not for everyone.</p>
<p>But I really loved it, and Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande both just have amazing voices.</p>
<p>I was really blown away by that.</p>
<p>The songs and how their voices blend and just the beautiful notes.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm excited to see it.</p>
<p>It's not as long as the first one, right?</p>
<p>Right, It felt very quick.</p>
<p>Okay, that's good.</p>
<p>But yeah, I guess you're probably used to the first one where you basically have to spend the whole day.</p>
<p>They have an intermission built in.</p>
<p>It was long.</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>I have to...</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>Yeah, my son has been asking to see it.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll have to surprise him and take him.</p>
<p>He'll like it.</p>
<p>So this is interesting.</p>
<p>We're talking about the word decent today.</p>
<p>This was inspired by a mistake we've heard students make where they use the adjective decent to mean good or really good.</p>
<p>Like maybe they would describe a movie and say it was a fantastic, decent film.</p>
<p>And I can really see why if you just look at the dictionary definition, I can see why this mistake is made.</p>
<p>Because, you know, decent has so many meanings and the definition says of an acceptable standard, satisfactory.</p>
<p>And I could see students thinking that means good, right?</p>
<p>But it doesn't really.</p>
<p>It's interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, that is very interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, this makes me think of my dad.</p>
<p>My dad to this day always says, oh, was it decent?</p>
<p>Like if you say, oh, I had this</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>I went to this restaurant.</p>
<p>Oh, was it decent?</p>
<p>Or even in our videos from childhood of vacations.</p>
<p>Oh, Michelle, how was it?</p>
<p>It was a decent?</p>
<p>That's so interesting.</p>
<p>He sort of has a low bar.</p>
<p>He's not asking if it was good.</p>
<p>Like decent meaning like, was it acceptable?</p>
<p>Right, acceptable, satisfactory.</p>
<p>Good enough.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>So I just think when I hear the word decent, I think of my dad.</p>
<p>But my dad is not just decent.</p>
<p>My dad is wonderful.</p>
<p>This is interesting.</p>
<p>You don't want to accidentally describe something as decent if you mean it's really good, right?</p>
<p>There's definitely a negative collocation to this.</p>
<p>That if you're calling something decent, you actually mean it wasn't that great.</p>
<p>It's fine.</p>
<p>It just passes, right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But that's not the only meaning for decent.</p>
<p>There are four different meanings.</p>
<p>So we're going to share all of them today with examples.</p>
<p>But guys, if you're not hitting follow on the All Ears English podcast, you are missing lots</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>

<p>Yes, it's fun to watch these episodes as a video.</p>
<p>So go check it out on YouTube.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>So let's dive in.</p>
<p>Yeah, the many definitions.</p>
<p>So number one is kind of this one that we've already been discussing, right?</p>
<p>I'll read this.</p>
<p>Good enough or acceptable.</p>
<p>Not amazing.</p>
<p>I like this, but meets minimum expectations.</p>
<p>Yeah, And I've definitely seen some films that I would describe as decent or right.</p>
<p>If something I'm like, it was all right.</p>
<p>I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone.</p>
<p>Then I would describe it as decent.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>So for example, the restaurant wasn't fancy, but the food was decent.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is interesting.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>Yeah, this is interesting.</p>
<p>You're not saying it was amazing, and you'd give five stars, recommend it to everyone, but it wasn't terrible.</p>
<p>The food was decent.</p>
<p>Or I got a decent score on the exam.</p>
<p>Not great, but not bad either.</p>
<p>You probably passed if you're saying your score was decent, but it certainly wasn't like 100%. Yes, yes.</p>
<p>So yeah, this is a really useful definition of this word.</p>
<p>And just so our listeners know, decent is spelled D-E-C-E-N-T. So good to know.</p>
<p>And this is tricky because if you add an S, we have the word descent, which is pronounced differently, spelled slightly differently.</p>
<p>I could see that confusing people, but yes, this has a different meaning.</p>
<p>That's if you have the C, right?</p>
<p>D-E, right?</p>
<p>That's descent.</p>
<p>So the second one, let's get into it, is respectable or reliable.</p>
<p>So honest, moral, having integrity.</p>
<p>And we use this a lot to describe people</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>We use this a lot to describe people who have good character.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it is a more positive connotation here.</p>
<p>If you say, for example, he seems like a decent guy, it's like, I'm not saying he's just barely passable, like this means he's a good person.</p>
<p>He's reliable, honest, has integrity.</p>
<p>So it's really strange.</p>
<p>I can see this being what the other reason students are maybe using decent incorrectly as an adjective to describe like a film, because when we use it to describe a person, it's very positive.</p>
<p>If someone's decent, they're like, they have high morals, you know, the good integrity, right?</p>
<p>Or she helped her elderly neighbor with his yard work, which was a really decent thing to do.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was like kind, right?</p>
<p>Thoughtful.</p>
<p>So yeah, really interesting how different those definitions are.</p>
<p>Or our third means like proper or appropriate.</p>
<p>Often this is about...</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>Often this is about modesty or it might mean presentable or appropriately dressed, right?</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Yeah, you could say, don't come in, I'm not decent, right?</p>
<p>So you might not even be wearing clothes, not have any clothes on, right?</p>
<p>Or if somebody knocks on the door, they might say, are you decent?</p>
<p>Like, can I come in?</p>
<p>Right, And often that means, are you clothed at all?</p>
<p>But then we'll also use this to mean I'm not dressed appropriately, right?</p>
<p>If you're like in sweats and you need to go outside, you'd be like, let me put something on, I'm not decent.</p>
<p>It just means like I'm not dressed to go out.</p>
<p>Right, right, right, exactly.</p>
<p>And then let's get into the last one we're going to share is fairly large or a respectable amount.</p>
<p>So this is used to describe an amount or quantity that is not small.</p>
<p>Such a different meaning.</p>
<p>It's so strange that we have the exact same word to mean this.</p>
<p>Why couldn't we come up with another word?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>That's really weird.</p>
<p>So for example,</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>So for example, we had a decent number of people show up to the event.</p>
<p>So this means like, it was quite a few, right?</p>
<p>It wasn't like, nobody showed up, we were really disappointed by the numbers.</p>
<p>We would use this to mean like, yeah, it was a decent number.</p>
<p>Like there, you know, this was not small, not just a few people.</p>
<p>Or they drove a decent distance before stopping.</p>
<p>Which would mean quite a bit, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, pretty.</p>
<p>Yeah, like a good portion.</p>
<p>Several hours maybe.</p>
<p>I wouldn't go 30 minutes and be like, I drove a decent distance if I have like a 15 hour drive in front of me.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Right, although it is relative.</p>
<p>Like let's say your child is learning to drive.</p>
<p>And you know, for them, 30 minutes, it's like, okay, yeah, you drove a decent amount.</p>
<p>Right, they're practicing.</p>
<p>That'd be a lot for them.</p>
<p>Good point.</p>
<p>Yeah, So it's interesting how this will, like your...</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>how your tone will change this a little bit, whether it's positive or negative.</p>
<p>Because imagine with this first one, if you were expecting thousands of people, it's like a fundraiser event, and maybe half the amount come that you want.</p>
<p>If you're like, yeah, we had a decent number.</p>
<p>And it's not that positive.</p>
<p>My tone kind of indicates that like, you know, there were quite a few people, but like I would have preferred more.</p>
<p>Yes, that's really interesting.</p>
<p>But if you said, if you did have a lot show up, you could say, oh, we had a decent number of people show up to the event.</p>
<p>So that's a different tone.</p>
<p>And it sounds like you were happy about the number.</p>
<p>So that's really, I like this topic.</p>
<p>Aubrey, this is a good one.</p>

<p>You are picking me up to give me a ride to the airport in this roleplay.</p>
<p>Thank you, Michelle.</p>
<p>So kind of you.</p>
<p>You are very welcome.</p>
<p>I am not letting you spend money on an Uber.</p>
<p>No, right?</p>
<p>Such a good friend, especially if it's early in the morning.</p>
<p>I've done this.</p>
<p>I've offered a ride and they're like, okay, we need to leave at four.</p>
<p>I'm like, if I had known that, maybe I wouldn't have offered.</p>
<p>It's hilarious.</p>
<p>Okay, let's start here.</p>
<p>I'll start us out.</p>
<p>Oh, I like your jacket.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I got it on sale for a decent price too.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>You've always been good at finding a deal.</p>
<p>Thanks for picking me up, by the way.</p>
<p>That was really decent of you.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>Are you ready?</p>
<p>Just need to change so I look decent.</p>
<p>I spilled coffee on this shirt a minute ago.</p>
<p>Oh, gotcha.</p>
<p>Hurry though.</p>
<p>It's a decent drive to the airport from here.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>And it's so interesting how it doesn't even sound strange to use decent so many times in this one conversation because there's all these different meanings.</p>
<p>It's weird that it's even the same word.</p>
<p>Right, that's true.</p>
<p>I don't know that I would do it that many times.</p>
<p>It has different definitions.</p>
<p>These are all different contexts.</p>
<p>But yeah, I still think we would want to vary what we say.</p>
<p>That's true, right?</p>
<p>We're using them on purpose in this roleplay, but if I had just said, so I look decent, you'd probably say, oh, it's a long drive to the airport, so let's go.</p>
<p>You probably wouldn't say it's a decent drive.</p>
<p>Right, it just might be a little overkill, but you are right that they have different, totally different definitions.</p>
<p>So let's go through it here.</p>
<p>You first said, I'm saying I like your jacket.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>I like your jacket.</p>
<p>Say, I got it on sale for a decent price.</p>
<p>So this is like, you know, good enough, acceptable.</p>
<p>Fair.</p>
<p>It wasn't the highest price.</p>
<p>A fair price.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And then you said, thanks for picking me up, by the way.</p>
<p>That was really decent of you.</p>
<p>So showing my good character.</p>
<p>I'm very nice.</p>
<p>What can I tell you?</p>
<p>Yes, right?</p>
<p>Thoughtful, kind.</p>
<p>That was really decent of you.</p>
<p>And this is interesting.</p>
<p>I likely would say to a friend instead, like thoughtful, kind, one of these words.</p>
<p>Decent does mean this.</p>
<p>We might use this more often.</p>
<p>The example about helping like an elderly neighbor with the landscaping.</p>
<p>This kind of thing where we're thinking of it more as going above and beyond, right?</p>
<p>Then we'd maybe say like, oh, he's such a decent guy.</p>
<p>He's always just doing really decent things.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>I'm imagining almost you're talking to somebody, you want to set them up on a date with somebody.</p>
<p>And you could say like, he's really decent.</p>
<p>Like he's, you know.</p>
<p>Right, describing their character.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>Yeah, that's how I would imagine it.</p>
<p>And then I like this, just need to change so I look decent.</p>
<p>I spilled coffee on this shirt a minute ago, right?</p>
<p>So you're saying so I looked acceptable even to go to the airport, or you don't want to be having coffee all over yourself.</p>
<p>Right, that is like if you've got this shirt stained with coffee, you'd be like, oh, I don't look decent.</p>
<p>Because it means not just like clothed at all, but also like appropriate for the occasion, clean clothing, right?</p>
<p>Right, and I think, I actually think that that's kind of the distinction here, right?</p>
<p>If you say, I'm not decent, right?</p>
<p>That almost sounds like you're not wearing clothes.</p>
<p>But if you're talking about so I look decent, to look decent is different than to be decent.</p>
<p>That's a good point, right?</p>
<p>When it's collocated with look, you're talking more about like my clothing isn't appropriate or it's not clean if I don't look decent.</p>
<p>Or maybe I haven't done my hair and my makeup, I don't look decent, don't take a photograph of me.</p>
<p>But then that chunk of I'm not</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>that chunk of I'm not decent.</p>
<p>That might mean I'm not dressed at all.</p>
<p>Like, don't come in.</p>
<p>I'm not decent might mean I just got out of the shower.</p>
<p>I'm not dressed at all.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>I'm in my towel or whatever, you know.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then the last one, you said, it's a decent drive to the airport, which would mean it's pretty far.</p>
<p>Yep, pretty far.</p>
<p>Yeah, oh my gosh, this is a very interesting word and I'm still thinking of my dad this whole episode.</p>
<p>Dad, this one goes out to you.</p>
<p>Nice, I love that.</p>
<p>I can see how this really could cause a misunderstanding, but if you describe something as decent when you mean it was fantastic, it was really good, but I can definitely see how that's confusing because when you're describing a person as fantastic in that they have good moral character, we do use decent.</p>
<p>So I'm glad we were able to dive into these details.</p>
<p>Right, and also, you know, as part of the takeaway, you also want to think about the tone of voice.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>But you also want to think about the tone of voice, right?</p>
<p>So that's also going to clue you in on what people are understanding.</p>
<p>Like that example that we talked about of how many people showed up, right?</p>
<p>Oh, it was a decent amount or oh yeah, we had a decent amount.</p>
<p>So you have to really listen in for these things.</p>
<p>Yes, the tone changes a lot depending on what exactly you mean by this word.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>All right, Aubrey, this was really fun.</p>
<p>And yeah, this is more than a decent episode.</p>
<p>Yes, I would not call this episode decent.</p>
<p>It was fantastic.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Thanks, Michelle.</p>
<p>I will see you next time.</p>
<p>Have a great day.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Thanks, Aubrey.</p>
