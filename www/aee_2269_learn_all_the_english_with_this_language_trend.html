<p id="p-9">Hey Lindsay, how are you? Excellent Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-10">I'm excited to be recording.</p>
<p id="p-11">All, all good.</p>
<p id="p-12">All good.</p>
<p id="p-13">How are you? How's it going? I'm good.</p>
<p id="p-14">I ate all the french fries yesterday at dinner, all the French fries.</p>
<p id="p-15">French fries.</p>
<p id="p-16">Do you when it comes to French fries? Do you like the skinny crunchy fries or the bigger steak fries? I like steak fries.</p>
<p id="p-17">I like sweet potato fries.</p>
<p id="p-18">I like all the fries.</p>
<p id="p-19">All the fries like you said.</p>
<p id="p-20">Yes, Well, we can talk more about that in a second on all ears.</p>
<p id="p-21">English.</p>
<p id="p-22">This is going to be a really fun episode.</p>
<p id="p-23">I am super psyched.</p>
<p id="p-24">I love when we cover very.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-25">I love when we cover very trendy language patterns.</p>
<p id="p-26">Yes, this is definitely.</p>
<p id="p-27">And we try to cover all the language pattern.</p>
<p id="p-28">That's right.</p>
<p id="p-29">Hopefully we don't overdo it today.</p>
<p id="p-30">But we do.</p>
<p id="p-31">I know, I know now I can't stop myself.</p>
<p id="p-32">We have a poll though first and we'll come back to what we're saying here.</p>
<p id="p-33">But yeah, we have a poll to report, right? Yes, we have some news um recently on episode 2245 we asked you guys a question.</p>
<p id="p-34">So this episode was, do you have a sibling episode 2245 if you haven't listened to that? Definitely check it out.</p>
<p id="p-35">And what was the whole question, Lindsay that is very straightforward.</p>
<p id="p-36">Do you have a sibling? And no, it wasn't.</p>
<p id="p-37">Do you have a sibling? It was, are you close with your sibling? Sorry.</p>
<p id="p-38">Are you close with your sibling? Right, So that is a more interesting question.</p>
<p id="p-39">Obviously, I'm curious about this around the world, you know, closeness among siblings in different cultures.</p>
<p id="p-40">Is it common? Is it uncommon? Is there something</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-41">Is it uncommon? Is there something cultural there? I'm super interested.</p>
<p id="p-42">But what was our result? What do we learn? Ok.</p>
<p id="p-43">So 66% of those who answered the poll said yes, that they have a close relationship with their sibling or siblings and 25% said no.</p>
<p id="p-44">And then 9% are an only child.</p>
<p id="p-45">I have a feeling there is something cultural just because I know that in certain countries we're more likely to stay in our hometown and probably our siblings are also more likely to stay in their hometown that too.</p>
<p id="p-46">Right, Whereas here it's like it doesn't mean you can't be close to your sibling.</p>
<p id="p-47">I think you're very close to your brother.</p>
<p id="p-48">Right, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-49">But we don't always live near our siblings.</p>
<p id="p-50">That's not a given, it's not a given, not a given.</p>
<p id="p-51">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-52">So that's interesting.</p>
<p id="p-53">But I would be curious to hear more about that around the world and how it might be different culturally.</p>
<p id="p-54">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-55">Maybe, maybe we'll engage in that in a live event, like a fluency party or an open conversation club.</p>
<p id="p-56">If you're in our courses</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-57">Conversation club.</p>
<p id="p-58">If you're in our courses, guys, you do get invited to those weekly events to practice speaking.</p>
<p id="p-59">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-60">That would be great.</p>
<p id="p-61">So, Lindsay, what did we start saying in the beginning? We got a little excited about it.</p>
<p id="p-62">I think I said it one too many times.</p>
<p id="p-63">Um But what did I say about the french fries? Did I just say, oh, I ate french fries last night? No, you didn't say that that would just be very basic and objective.</p>
<p id="p-64">You said I ate all the fries, all the french fries last night.</p>
<p id="p-65">And so all the fries in the whole world, kind of, yeah, that's sort of what you're saying, isn't it? Not literally? But, well, this is a very trendy grammar construction that we're hearing a lot.</p>
<p id="p-66">So Lindsay, uh you came up with this idea and this is a great one.</p>
<p id="p-67">Do you? Is this something that you say? And naturally in your day to day life, would you say you say it? Would you say it? Do you hear it more still? This is not a trend that I personally have picked up because sometimes I, I stay away from super trendy things because if I hear my.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-68">Trendy things because if I hear myself say it, I kind of roll my eyes a little bit.</p>
<p id="p-69">I'm not saying I don't say it ever, but it's not something I say often, but I understand it.</p>
<p id="p-70">I like it.</p>
<p id="p-71">I like to hear it.</p>
<p id="p-72">I know what it means and I can really get in like, engage in a conversation when someone says this because we get what they're saying.</p>
<p id="p-73">Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-74">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-75">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-76">Um, so let's talk it through.</p>
<p id="p-77">So this is again, it's all the blank.</p>
<p id="p-78">Yes, Yes, Oh, blank.</p>
<p id="p-79">Let's do an example and we'll come back to our reminder for our listeners.</p>
<p id="p-80">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-81">So for example, Michelle, do you want ice cream? Yes, I want all the ice cream.</p>
<p id="p-82">Yes, So, and that is accurate.</p>
<p id="p-83">I do.</p>
<p id="p-84">And I know how much you like ice.</p>
<p id="p-85">This has been a big ice cream summer for me personally.</p>
<p id="p-86">It has been for me as well.</p>
<p id="p-87">And I'm not even, I, I always think of you as the ice cream person and I'm more of the cookie person.</p>
<p id="p-88">But you doing a lot of ice cream lately? A lot of ice cream? Oh, my</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-89">A lot of ice cream.</p>
<p id="p-90">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-91">I took my son.</p>
<p id="p-92">Oh yeah, I took him for ice cream the other day and he ate all the ice this guy.</p>
<p id="p-93">Oh God, I felt terrible about myself that I let him do this but let him enjoy.</p>
<p id="p-94">He had three different scoops on top of us.</p>
<p id="p-95">Oh, that's so cute.</p>
<p id="p-96">Yeah, it was, it was so typical.</p>
<p id="p-97">A kid with an ice cream cone.</p>
<p id="p-98">It was very, very cute.</p>
<p id="p-99">But everything like going down the wrist and everything, I imagine ice cream everywhere, the arm.</p>
<p id="p-100">So that's exactly how it was.</p>
<p id="p-101">Well, that, that actually is a good way of talking about this phrase all the x because kids fully engage and that's kind of what this concept is saying.</p>
<p id="p-102">Right? Do you like this or do you want this? I want all of this won't be more typical of a kid.</p>
<p id="p-103">Like so adults will use this, but it's an idea of fully engaging in something and fully loving something and expressing that.</p>
<p id="p-104">Yes, Yes, That's true.</p>
<p id="p-105">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-106">So guys, before we talk</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-107">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-108">So guys, before we talk about this a little bit more, we want to remind you to hit, follow wherever you are listening to the All Ears English podcast because we don't want you to miss anything from us.</p>
<p id="p-109">And we have, we have a lot of things to teach you.</p>
<p id="p-110">Excellent, excellent.</p>
<p id="p-111">Let's get deeper into this.</p>
<p id="p-112">I think our listeners are feeling curious and excited to take on this new language trend.</p>
<p id="p-113">So, what is this about? What else can we tell our listeners here? Right, So it doesn't necessarily mean that you really want all of the ice cream that you ate all the french fries.</p>
<p id="p-114">It's a little bit more metaphorical, it shows enthusiasm.</p>
<p id="p-115">So when you do this, you're showing that you're really enthusiastic about something.</p>
<p id="p-116">Um You really want something however it's being used.</p>
<p id="p-117">Um But it just adds that enthusiasm and like Lindsay said, it's a little bit trendy.</p>
<p id="p-118">So if you are, if you have a personality where you like to use those expressions, this would be a good one to try.</p>
<p id="p-119">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-120">And the only warning would be don't overuse it because then</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-121">Would be, don't overuse it because then people will be confused about.</p>
<p id="p-122">Just save it for the things that you're really excited about.</p>
<p id="p-123">I would say.</p>
<p id="p-124">Right, Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p id="p-125">I mean, I do want to draw our attention over to one other episode because this was another similar idea of really trendy language.</p>
<p id="p-126">That's slangy.</p>
<p id="p-127">That was episode 2265.</p>
<p id="p-128">That was, when should you stop talking? It's a whole thing.</p>
<p id="p-129">I love that title.</p>
<p id="p-130">Yeah, it's so fun.</p>
<p id="p-131">So that, that also, yeah, you're right.</p>
<p id="p-132">It's equally trendy and good to learn these trends and then you guys can decide whether you want to use them once in a while.</p>
<p id="p-133">Never or all the time.</p>
<p id="p-134">It's up to you.</p>
<p id="p-135">It's your personality.</p>
<p id="p-136">We're showing you how to express your personality in English.</p>
<p id="p-137">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-138">Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-139">So, ok, this can be really used to talk about your preferences, your routines, maybe the news even.</p>
<p id="p-140">It's, it's just something.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-141">It's, it's just something that you're enthusiastic about consuming, whether that's, you know, food movies TV, show, I want to watch all the episodes of Friends and I like the word consuming here because this is really about consumption.</p>
<p id="p-142">That could be, as you said, media consuming, media, consuming food.</p>
<p id="p-143">Um Interesting, interesting.</p>
<p id="p-144">Yeah, it is, it is interesting.</p>
<p id="p-145">Um how this, how this can be used.</p>
<p id="p-146">So um I mean, what does it add to, for example, the ice cream one we did.</p>
<p id="p-147">So I want all the ice cream.</p>
<p id="p-148">Um Yeah, just saying you're excited about ice cream, right? It's just saying you love ice cream and you want to eat ice cream right now, right? It doesn't mean you want every flavor they have behind the counter, but you are excited about it.</p>
<p id="p-149">You're all in Linda.</p>
<p id="p-150">You're a chocolate peanut butter, right? Or when I can get it.</p>
<p id="p-151">It's hard to find though.</p>
<p id="p-152">I'm telling you.</p>
<p id="p-153">Yeah, it's hard to find.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-154">Yeah, it's hard to find peanut butter, kind of kind of.</p>
<p id="p-155">Yeah, chocolate peanut butter or anything.</p>
<p id="p-156">Double chocolate, chocolate, chocolate brownie.</p>
<p id="p-157">There's this JP lick is in Boston.</p>
<p id="p-158">I was just back in Boston.</p>
<p id="p-159">They have this brownie batter.</p>
<p id="p-160">Oh gosh, it's incredible.</p>
<p id="p-161">Does it have chunks in it or? Yeah, kind of.</p>
<p id="p-162">It has chunks and it's good.</p>
<p id="p-163">It's good.</p>
<p id="p-164">Yes, Oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-165">Um That sounds good.</p>
<p id="p-166">So let's do some more example.</p>
<p id="p-167">Not, not a ice cream because I'm getting really, I know I know how much ice cream can I have.</p>
<p id="p-168">It's like let's talk about coffee because that's another thing I go deep into.</p>
<p id="p-169">Um, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-170">Are you tired? Yes, let's get coffee.</p>
<p id="p-171">Yes, please.</p>
<p id="p-172">I need all the coffee.</p>
<p id="p-173">All right.</p>
<p id="p-174">So this is interesting, right? Because I would reserve this for moments when you really need a lot of coffee.</p>
<p id="p-175">Not, maybe not every day, right? On a daily basis.</p>
<p id="p-176">Like for example, last Friday, I took a red eye.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-177">For example, last Friday, I took a red eye last Thursday night, I did the red eye mistake again.</p>
<p id="p-178">I made it again, terrible mistake.</p>
<p id="p-179">It gets worse every year, Michelle when I do that.</p>
<p id="p-180">It was so funny.</p>
<p id="p-181">And so I had to spend the day we watched the opening ceremonies with my parents in their retirement home and everyone was perky and you know, watching it, I was falling asleep in the chair.</p>
<p id="p-182">I mean, and so it was just that day, I needed all the coffee, right? But I wouldn't necessarily say that today today.</p>
<p id="p-183">I'm OK, You know, I'm drinking coffee, but I don't need all the coffee.</p>
<p id="p-184">OK? So I just want to make that differentiation there.</p>
<p id="p-185">Right, Right, Right, Now that is, but it's also interesting because we're talking about needs here.</p>
<p id="p-186">So we're as the ice cream, we're talking, we're saying want, right.</p>
<p id="p-187">I want all.</p>
<p id="p-188">So you could say I want all the coffee, let's say you're in a um in a really cool coffee shop and they have the beans there and different flavors and you were really into coffee.</p>
<p id="p-189">You could say, oh, I want all the coffee.</p>
<p id="p-190">So you should say that.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-191">All the coffee.</p>
<p id="p-192">So you should say that.</p>
<p id="p-193">But when it comes to need, it's a little bit different.</p>
<p id="p-194">Which is interesting.</p>
<p id="p-195">Yeah, that is interesting.</p>
<p id="p-196">So, that's more of a physical need, right? If you feel that your body really needs caffeine, you're really tired, you might say that.</p>
<p id="p-197">Let's give another example.</p>
<p id="p-198">I like these little role plays.</p>
<p id="p-199">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-200">Oh, take a picture.</p>
<p id="p-201">Oh, I don't have any more room on my phone.</p>
<p id="p-202">Oh, jeez.</p>
<p id="p-203">You must take a lot of pictures.</p>
<p id="p-204">I take all the pictures.</p>
<p id="p-205">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-206">So this is interesting.</p>
<p id="p-207">So we're not talking about consuming or eating, drinking ice cream.</p>
<p id="p-208">It's about things you do habit.</p>
<p id="p-209">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-210">So, yeah, this is, this is a little bit of a different one but still very useful.</p>
<p id="p-211">Um, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-212">Do you take a lot of pictures? Uh, not really.</p>
<p id="p-213">I don't, I don't tend to take when I travel.</p>
<p id="p-214">I just, um, usually my travel partner would be the one taking the photo.</p>
<p id="p-215">So it's just photos of me.</p>
<p id="p-216">Like, um, it's hilarious.</p>
<p id="p-217">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-218">No, I don't.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-219">It's hilarious.</p>
<p id="p-220">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-221">No, I don't, I don't know, I want to be present.</p>
<p id="p-222">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-223">Or I'm just too lazy to get my phone out, you know.</p>
<p id="p-224">So, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-225">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-226">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-227">Um, yeah, I, I find that, uh, yeah, my dad loves to take a lot of pictures and I mean, I have the same photo of like that he's taken of me at the Hudson River with the skyline 100 times and every time it's always, oh, like it's the first time.</p>
<p id="p-228">So it's very sweet.</p>
<p id="p-229">Um, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-230">Um, and then I wanted to teach one bonus that's a little bit different.</p>
<p id="p-231">But it's a similar idea, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-232">What is this? Yeah, this is really trendy.</p>
<p id="p-233">So if we take this language construction, this, uh, this pattern we've shown you and then we take it to the most trendy way of using it.</p>
<p id="p-234">It is the phrase all the feels.</p>
<p id="p-235">So Michelle, I almost feel like we need a little role play here.</p>
<p id="p-236">Or like to understand how do we use this, all the fields.</p>
<p id="p-237">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-238">Yeah, you're right.</p>
<p id="p-239">And I don't have a role play.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-240">Yeah, you're right.</p>
<p id="p-241">And I don't have a role play.</p>
<p id="p-242">So let's think about it.</p>
<p id="p-243">So I could say um, oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-244">Did you see that movie? It wasn't an incredible, right? And then I might say something like, yeah, I got all the feels right.</p>
<p id="p-245">Or I'm having all the feels.</p>
<p id="p-246">I'm getting all the feels.</p>
<p id="p-247">All of those would be correct.</p>
<p id="p-248">Right, Michelle, you may need to correct me here because I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-249">No, no, you're right.</p>
<p id="p-250">It's all the feels.</p>
<p id="p-251">It just basically means a strong emotions, right? You might just, you might be intense sadness or intense happiness or whatever.</p>
<p id="p-252">It is just a intense emotion.</p>
<p id="p-253">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-254">I like that.</p>
<p id="p-255">So that's an important one to note down guys, you don't have to use it.</p>
<p id="p-256">You can, if you want, if you want a special way to show that you're feeling things that's perfect.</p>
<p id="p-257">Perfectly trendy.</p>
<p id="p-258">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-259">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-260">Now, just curious, Lindsay this whole all the french fries ice cream feels.</p>
<p id="p-261">Do, do you think these are too casual for work? What do you think? Uh Good question Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-262">Hm.</p>
<p id="p-263">No, I don't think they are</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-264">No, I don't think they are.</p>
<p id="p-265">I don't think they are because our approach to work to business English is we, are humans going into work? Maybe you're not saying it in the middle of a fancy boardroom meeting.</p>
<p id="p-266">Right, Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-267">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-268">But you could be saying it as you're going out for lunch with a coworker or you are at happy hour after work in between meetings.</p>
<p id="p-269">Yes, Yes, Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-270">Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-271">It's a little bit casual but it depends on the workplace culture and when you were to use it, but it definitely shows personality confidence.</p>
<p id="p-272">It could even be a little bit self deprecating.</p>
<p id="p-273">Um So, you know, it, it really depends how it's how it's used.</p>
<p id="p-274">Anything else you want to bring up about it before we um before we start a roleplay? Yeah, let's, well, let's take a quick break, Michelle and then we're gonna come back and get into a role play.</p>
<p id="p-275">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-276">Shall we? Ok.</p>
<p id="p-277">Ok, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-278">So again, tone of voice matters here.</p>
<p id="p-279">Right, What do we want to bring that up before?</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-280">What do you want to bring that up before we get into the role play? We've been doing a lot of role plays already.</p>
<p id="p-281">But again, if you say I want all the ice cream, right.</p>
<p id="p-282">That's not gonna sound, it's not, you not working well.</p>
<p id="p-283">I'm gonna, I was gonna say they might literally think you mean you want to eat every single pint of ice cream.</p>
<p id="p-284">Like if you said it like that and you were at an ice cream stand, like they might think you're like an ice cream Bank Robber, like, like I want the ice cream or you're a competitive eater or something, right? Competitive ice cream eater or something.</p>
<p id="p-285">And then, and then you think you're using in this metaphorical way and then they come out with all these pints of ice cream and they're like, oh, that'll be $700.</p>
<p id="p-286">Right, Right, Right, Or the sauces if you go for tacos and they give you a choice of the sauces and you say I want all the sauces, they're going to bring you like 17 different types of sauces.</p>
<p id="p-287">Right, Right, Right, Right, So you got to be careful about it.</p>
<p id="p-288">So you really got to hit that.</p>
<p id="p-289">All this is important.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-290">This is important.</p>
<p id="p-291">You got to hit it or else or else it's, it's not going to land.</p>
<p id="p-292">That's really interesting.</p>
<p id="p-293">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-294">So, um, actually not going to land is we're going to do a few because I heard that a couple of times the other day and I was like, oh, that's a good one and so glad that came up.</p>
<p id="p-295">So guys remember to hit follow.</p>
<p id="p-296">But anyway, you got to exaggerate that all you want all the ice cream and it's also the timing in which you deliver that right at all.</p>
<p id="p-297">So for example, you let's go back to the tacos.</p>
<p id="p-298">Example with the salsa.</p>
<p id="p-299">You sit down at a restaurant, you're looking at the menu with your friend and you look at the different salsas.</p>
<p id="p-300">Maybe you say I want all the salsas, the sauces, but not when the waitress comes over.</p>
<p id="p-301">You're not going to say that you're gonna say which ones you want, right? So that's funny.</p>
<p id="p-302">Good point, right? Because you don't know if they're gonna take it literally and then yeah.</p>
<p id="p-303">Um Yeah, you could get like a whole</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p id="p-304">Uh Yeah, you could get like a whole lot like a flight of all the sauces.</p>
<p id="p-305">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-306">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-307">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-308">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-309">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-310">So we're saying a very different thing from exactly what we want.</p>
<p id="p-311">We're just saying we're excited about it.</p>
<p id="p-312">Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, That's a very good point.</p>
<p id="p-313">So let's just do one more role play and close it out.</p>
<p id="p-314">All right, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-315">So, hey, oh, should we get a margarita? Ok.</p>
<p id="p-316">We're on a, we're at a, on a vacation.</p>
<p id="p-317">We're about to set the scene there just went right into it because I, it seems like we're having Mexican food.</p>
<p id="p-318">So I love it.</p>
<p id="p-319">All right.</p>
<p id="p-320">So, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-321">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-322">Uh we are friends and we're on a vacation at a resort.</p>
<p id="p-323">There we go.</p>
<p id="p-324">So, should we get a margarita? Uh Yes, let's get all the margaritas.</p>
<p id="p-325">I can't wait to sit at the pool and just relax.</p>
<p id="p-326">Same and I can't wait to eat all the cookies at the bakery near the lobby.</p>
<p id="p-327">Oh, yes.</p>
<p id="p-328">All right, cool.</p>
<p id="p-329">So yeah, this is a great example of when this all comes out when you're kind of looking at a menu or you're looking at</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p id="p-330">At a menu or you're looking at what you could get and you're talking to your friend.</p>
<p id="p-331">Right, Right, And especially on a vacation.</p>
<p id="p-332">Right, You get a little bit.</p>
<p id="p-333">Oh, I'm on vacation.</p>
<p id="p-334">Right, There is some meaning implied there of like, I want to relax.</p>
<p id="p-335">Maybe I've been working hard.</p>
<p id="p-336">I'm ready to let loose, you know.</p>
<p id="p-337">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-338">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-339">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-340">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-341">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-342">So, just to quickly go through it, you said, I said, let's get all the margarita.</p>
<p id="p-343">So I'm not, I don't really mean that because then I would get alcohol poisoning.</p>
<p id="p-344">I would recommend that for sure.</p>
<p id="p-345">And then you said I can't, I said I can't wait to sit at the pool and just relax.</p>
<p id="p-346">You said same.</p>
<p id="p-347">And then I said, and I can't wait to eat all the cookies in the bakery near the lobby.</p>
<p id="p-348">Right, So I noticed that there was a plate of cookies when we checked in and so I'm going to go back there, I'm saying I'm not going to literally eat them all.</p>
<p id="p-349">Of course, I'm just excited to enjoy maybe one or two.</p>
<p id="p-350">Right, Right, Right, Exactly.</p>
<h2>Part-21</h2>
<p id="p-351">Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-352">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-353">This was a fun one.</p>
<p id="p-354">Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-355">I'm glad you.</p>
<p id="p-356">This has been fun.</p>
<p id="p-357">I hope our listeners had as much fun as we did.</p>
<p id="p-358">But guys, this is great.</p>
<p id="p-359">Clearly, there's a very different meaning.</p>
<p id="p-360">You are not ordering everything on the menu.</p>
<p id="p-361">OK, That's important to know.</p>
<p id="p-362">Right, Right, Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-363">Well, this is a lot of fun.</p>
<p id="p-364">Thank you for bringing this to our attention.</p>
<p id="p-365">Lindsay, this language trend guys.</p>
<p id="p-366">Again, this is very, very trendy.</p>
<p id="p-367">So decide how you wanna use it if you feel more comfortable listening for it at first go for it.</p>
<p id="p-368">But also, uh uh it would be good because I'm thinking if we have any listeners who are baristas or waiters or waitresses and you might want to clarify if somebody says it like that.</p>
<p id="p-369">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-370">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-371">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-372">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-373">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-374">For sure.</p>
<p id="p-375">And you know, be selective, right? Be kind of concise in how often you use it, don't overuse it, then it will lose its meaning and when we overuse something, it becomes less fun because people don't truly get the meaning of what you're trying to say.</p>
<h2>Part-22</h2>
<p id="p-376">The meaning of what you're trying to say.</p>
<p id="p-377">Right, Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-378">Right, Right, Right, So good point.</p>
<p id="p-379">All right.</p>
<p id="p-380">Well, Lindsay, thanks so much for chatting with me.</p>
<p id="p-381">This has been a very fun one.</p>
<p id="p-382">Thanks for the topic, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-383">Let's go get all the ice cream now.</p>
<p id="p-384">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-385">I'm gonna get all the ice.</p>
<p id="p-386">All right.</p>
<p id="p-387">Take care.</p>
<p id="p-388">Have a good one.</p>
