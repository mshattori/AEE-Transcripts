<p id="p-16">Hey there, Michelle, what's shaking?</p>
<p id="p-17">Not too much, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-18">How are you?</p>
<p id="p-19">Fantastic, fantastic.</p>
<p id="p-20">What are we getting into on All Ears English today?</p>
<p id="p-21">Lindsay, who is the smartest person you know?</p>
<p id="p-22">And don't say me, don't say me.</p>
<p id="p-23">I know you want to.</p>
<p id="p-24">Just joking.</p>
<p id="p-25">Well, I think my brother's pretty smart, actually.</p>
<p id="p-26">You know, he's pretty good.</p>
<p id="p-27">You know, he's an engineer.</p>
<p id="p-28">He's...</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-29">He's an engineer.</p>
<p id="p-30">He's pretty smart, I would say.</p>
<p id="p-31">What about you, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-32">That's funny.</p>
<p id="p-33">I was going to say my brother's pretty smart, too.</p>
<p id="p-34">Oh, weird.</p>
<p id="p-35">I would never want him to hear this because I don't want him to know that I'm complimenting him.</p>
<p id="p-36">Right, No, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-37">No, he's a lawyer and he's one of those people, I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-38">I always believe what he says.</p>
<p id="p-39">He's your big brother, right?</p>
<p id="p-40">Yeah, right.</p>
<p id="p-41">That's true.</p>
<p id="p-42">So I always feel like he has a really good sense about things.</p>
<p id="p-43">That's good.</p>
<p id="p-44">Yeah, It's good to have someone around who has a very good intuition about things and they can articulate it for you, but not in an overbearing way.</p>
<p id="p-45">You can say, what do you think about this?</p>
<p id="p-46">Just to get this outside opinion.</p>
<p id="p-47">Really good.</p>
<p id="p-48">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-49">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-50">All right.</p>
<p id="p-51">Well, we're going to be talking about this more in a second.</p>
<p id="p-52">But before we do, we want to say thank you so much to our reviewers.</p>
<p id="p-53">Guys, we're so appreciative.</p>
<p id="p-54">Right, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-55">Yeah, we so appreciate.</p>
<p id="p-56">Every time we read a new review,</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-57">Every time we read a new review, we just, we love it.</p>
<p id="p-58">It just keeps us podcasting for you.</p>
<p id="p-59">It keeps us happy.</p>
<p id="p-60">We love to see that this show makes an impact on you.</p>
<p id="p-61">That's what this is all about.</p>
<p id="p-62">So a special thank you to our reviewer Anonymous on January 5th, left a five-star review and a special thank you to Mohamed Bala Ahmed on January 1st from the UAE, also left a five-star review.</p>
<p id="p-63">Huge thank you to these listeners.</p>
<p id="p-64">Thank you.</p>
<p id="p-65">Thank you so much.</p>
<p id="p-66">We really appreciate it.</p>
<p id="p-67">We do.</p>
<p id="p-68">Lindsay, so we are going to get into the question today.</p>
<p id="p-69">This is from Kate.</p>
<p id="p-70">Do you want me to read the question for a change?</p>
<p id="p-71">Sure, Michelle, go for it.</p>
<p id="p-72">Read us the question, please.</p>
<p id="p-73">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-74">This says, hello, AEE family.</p>
<p id="p-75">Hope you all had a nice Thanksgiving with your family and friends.</p>
<p id="p-76">So guys, this is from a little while ago.</p>
<p id="p-77">But it says, I'd like to inquire about how you use this word smart in real life.</p>
<p id="p-78">On Thanksgiving day, I met my American in-laws and</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-79">my American in-laws and they use smart very often.</p>
<p id="p-80">I thought it was a compliment when they said it to me until I realized it was not a big deal because they also used that word for almost everyone.</p>
<p id="p-81">That's funny.</p>
<p id="p-82">That's really funny.</p>
<p id="p-83">How would you describe people who are smart?</p>
<p id="p-84">What are the characteristics of smart people and what's the difference between being smart and bright, well-educated or intelligent?</p>
<p id="p-85">And which adjective is suitable for a person who excels at math or science specifically?</p>
<p id="p-86">Thank you.</p>
<p id="p-87">Best regards, Kate.</p>
<p id="p-88">Great question, Kate.</p>
<p id="p-89">And that's a funny scenario being in that situation, especially when you're learning a language.</p>
<p id="p-90">You're in a place where you hear a word.</p>
<p id="p-91">You think it's uniquely being spoken to you, but then you hear the person say it to everyone else in the room.</p>
<p id="p-92">It's almost like a movie or something, right?</p>
<p id="p-93">Yeah, there's actually a Seinfeld.</p>
<p id="p-94">Yeah, that this reminds me of.</p>
<p id="p-95">So anyway, Kate, this is a great question.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-96">Anyway, Kate, this is a great question.</p>
<p id="p-97">So, oh my gosh, we have a lot to get into today.</p>
<p id="p-98">Let's dive in.</p>
<p id="p-99">So let's talk about smart first.</p>
<p id="p-100">So to me, this is the most basic version, right?</p>
<p id="p-101">And very, very common, which is probably why you hear them use it a lot.</p>
<p id="p-102">Right, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-103">Sure, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-104">It's the most basic for sure, the most common.</p>
<p id="p-105">It can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-106">So obviously it can mean cerebral, conceptual intelligence, but it can mean other things too.</p>
<p id="p-107">For example, you could look smart.</p>
<p id="p-108">And I guess that could also mean two things.</p>
<p id="p-109">Maybe you look studious or like a good student or something.</p>
<p id="p-110">But more often, what, Michelle, when it comes to fashion?</p>
<p id="p-111">Yeah, well, if you're using it to talk about fashion, it means you look good, right?</p>
<p id="p-112">It's like, I wouldn't say it to someone wearing a ball gown.</p>
<p id="p-113">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-114">But, you know, if you just kind of look, it's the same idea.</p>
<p id="p-115">You look sharp, right?</p>
<p id="p-116">Sharp or smart.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-117">You look sharp, right?</p>
<p id="p-118">Sharp or smart, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-119">Like your shirt is tucked in, maybe things match, your clothes look clean and ironed, pressed, you look good, you look sharp, you look smart, okay?</p>
<p id="p-120">So that's veering away from the idea of conceptual intelligence, right?</p>
<p id="p-121">Right, interesting.</p>
<p id="p-122">But it could be about this basic idea of just maybe it's about a specific topic.</p>
<p id="p-123">So for example, I feel so smart when I get the right answers when I watch Jeopardy! Sure, yeah, you could hear people say that all the time, 100%. So I agree, Michelle, that the word smart is the more common way to articulate this concept, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-124">Right, Lindsay, do you watch Jeopardy?</p>
<p id="p-125">Jeopardy, I don't see it on TV much anymore.</p>
<p id="p-126">I mean, I have flipped through the channels and it would be on.</p>
<p id="p-127">Yeah, what about you, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-128">Are you a Jeopardy person?</p>
<p id="p-129">There are people who watch Jeopardy every single day, you know?</p>
<p id="p-130">My parents watch Jeopardy, not every single day, but they get into phases.</p>
<p id="p-131">I think my brother-in-law watches it all</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-132">I think my brother-in-law watches it almost every day.</p>
<p id="p-133">A lot of people, there are people who just, it's almost because I think it's kind of a comforting show because it's been on for so long.</p>
<p id="p-134">I think it's one of those comfort shows.</p>
<p id="p-135">But yeah, I don't watch it.</p>
<p id="p-136">I watch it mostly when I'm with the people who watch it.</p>
<p id="p-137">I remember my grandmother used to watch Wheel of Fortune every day.</p>
<p id="p-138">She had her schedule.</p>
<p id="p-139">It'd come on at like 4.30.</p>
<p id="p-140">She'd turn the TV on for Wheel of Fortune.</p>
<p id="p-141">Yeah, it's that comfort.</p>
<p id="p-142">It's that comfort for sure.</p>
<p id="p-143">But yeah, Smart is the most basic one.</p>
<p id="p-144">I don't know why your in-laws were using it to describe everyone.</p>
<p id="p-145">But I mean, I guess they're being very nice.</p>
<p id="p-146">And take the compliment.</p>
<p id="p-147">I'm sure they still mean it about you.</p>
<p id="p-148">Of course.</p>
<p id="p-149">I wouldn't take it personally either way.</p>
<p id="p-150">I'd say in general, yeah, it can be intense, Kate, right?</p>
<p id="p-151">Meeting your in-laws, especially if English is your second language and maybe they're native speakers of English.</p>
<p id="p-152">That could be very intense.</p>
<p id="p-153">But I wouldn't worry too much about...</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-154">but I wouldn't worry too much about that kind of scenario.</p>
<p id="p-155">You can build the relationship with them in other ways.</p>
<p id="p-156">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-157">So let's go through some of the other ones Kate asked about.</p>
<p id="p-158">Okay, bright, what do you think of this one, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-159">So I think this maybe has a slight hint of a bit more energy to it.</p>
<p id="p-160">Maybe a bit more of a youthful tone, I think.</p>
<p id="p-161">Like maybe to describe younger people, I would say.</p>
<p id="p-162">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-163">Yeah, that's probably not going to be found in the dictionary, but that's just the feeling I'm getting when I'm thinking about this.</p>
<p id="p-164">For example, your example, Michelle, is about a child, right?</p>
<p id="p-165">He's a very bright boy.</p>
<p id="p-166">He just needs to apply himself more.</p>
<p id="p-167">So it might be something that a teacher would say to parents in a parent-teacher conference.</p>
<p id="p-168">Do you agree with that, with the youthfulness to that word a little bit?</p>
<p id="p-169">I do.</p>
<p id="p-170">Well, to me, I also think of a light bulb, you know?</p>
<p id="p-171">I think of the light bulb being bright, and so that's just kind of the image.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-172">The image I get with it is that, yeah, they know a lot.</p>
<p id="p-173">I do agree.</p>
<p id="p-174">I think there's a lot of energy youthfulness to this.</p>
<p id="p-175">Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-176">There's some youthfulness.</p>
<p id="p-177">I mean, it doesn't mean you can't refer to someone in their 70s as bright.</p>
<p id="p-178">You could.</p>
<p id="p-179">It would be correct.</p>
<p id="p-180">But for some reason, we might just use this on the younger end of the spectrum for some reason.</p>
<p id="p-181">Yeah, Okay.</p>
<p id="p-182">All right, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-183">What else?</p>
<p id="p-184">Well-educated.</p>
<p id="p-185">Well-educated.</p>
<p id="p-186">Yes, Okay, so Lindsay, what is this one?</p>
<p id="p-187">This one is more to me about being studious or more dealing with school.</p>
<p id="p-188">But what's interesting is you can be well-educated and not smart or smart but not well-educated.</p>
<p id="p-189">Yeah, of course.</p>
<p id="p-190">Does that make sense?</p>
<p id="p-191">Of course, 100%. 100%. Just because you've spent tons of money on education, which we would in the US, and years and years, it doesn't mean you've learned to think for yourself.</p>
<p id="p-192">Right?</p>
<p id="p-193">To think in a critical way.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-194">in a critical way and to think in your own way.</p>
<p id="p-195">A lot of what unfortunately the school system does, at least here in the US, teaches us a certain formula, a certain template of how to pass classes, right?</p>
<p id="p-196">How to write a paper and cite citations and things like that.</p>
<p id="p-197">But are we really learning how to think critically?</p>
<p id="p-198">Not always, not always.</p>
<p id="p-199">Right, and sometimes we're learning, a lot of times we're learning things that we don't actually need in the real world.</p>
<p id="p-200">Like, you know, you never learn to balance a checkbook or about like your finances in school or how to unclog the toilet or, you know, things like that.</p>
<p id="p-201">You know, you're learning, it's the whole, I think we've talked about book smart and street smart before.</p>
<p id="p-202">It kind of goes back to that.</p>
<p id="p-203">Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-204">And there's also other ways of being intelligent.</p>
<p id="p-205">And, you know, I think that this is important.</p>
<p id="p-206">Some people have uncanny emotional intelligence.</p>
<p id="p-207">It's just unbelievable.</p>
<p id="p-208">And 10 times out of 10, that's going to get them further in life than conceptual.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-209">than life than conceptual IQ intelligence, to be honest.</p>
<p id="p-210">I would argue that that's probably more important in life to be successful is EQ.</p>
<p id="p-211">Mm-hmm, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-212">So you want to read the example for this one?</p>
<p id="p-213">Yeah, so here we go.</p>
<p id="p-214">I don't care how well-educated she is, she doesn't know how to read people's emotions and it gets in the way of her work.</p>
<p id="p-215">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-216">Just what you were saying.</p>
<p id="p-217">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-218">There's also other forms of intelligence like spiritual intelligence, like people who are very in touch with their body, with the earth, with, you know, there's just a lot of ways of being smart, you know?</p>
<p id="p-219">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-220">It's not all like just if you pass your test.</p>
<p id="p-221">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-222">Right?</p>
<p id="p-223">Now let's go over to the word intelligent because we've been throwing it out there.</p>
<p id="p-224">So this is to me overall about a person sounding a little more well-rounded.</p>
<p id="p-225">It's not necessarily specific to one topic.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-226">pick to one topic.</p>
<p id="p-227">It's more like a whole person or a whole animal.</p>
<p id="p-228">For example, in this example is I've heard dolphins are very intelligent.</p>
<p id="p-229">Does that make sense what I'm trying to say or is it just I'm confused?</p>
<p id="p-230">No, I think it makes sense.</p>
<p id="p-231">I've heard that also that elephants are, by the way, elephants are supposed to be really intelligent, which is really cool.</p>
<p id="p-232">It's fun to know which animals are intelligent, you know, which animals have that sense and maybe build families, stick with their partners for life.</p>
<p id="p-233">Penguins, for example.</p>
<p id="p-234">Yeah, Really kind of cool stuff.</p>
<p id="p-235">I actually don't know.</p>
<p id="p-236">Oh, yeah, dolphins are intelligent.</p>
<p id="p-237">I was just making sure I didn't make that up.</p>
<p id="p-238">I thought that they were.</p>
<p id="p-239">I think you can also be really book smart but not have much common sense.</p>
<p id="p-240">And I guess that is kind of street smarts, as we've said earlier in the episode.</p>
<p id="p-241">But common sense is, again, kind of intuition about what should be done in this scenario or this scenario.</p>
<p id="p-242">And in the end, yeah, these are all different ways of being smart.</p>
<p id="p-243">But intelligent is, I agree with you, Michelle, it's more broad.</p>
<p id="p-244">It's more well-rounded, I would say.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-245">It's more well-rounded, I would say.</p>
<p id="p-246">Right, right, right, right.</p>
<p id="p-247">Okay, anything else we need to know here about different ways to say smart?</p>
<p id="p-248">Yes, well, we're going to talk about a couple different things before we wrap up the episode.</p>
<p id="p-249">So, we're also going to add the word knowledgeable.</p>
<p id="p-250">Knowledgeable, that's a big one.</p>
<p id="p-251">Lindsay, what is knowledgeable?</p>
<p id="p-252">Yeah, so generally just knowing a lot about a specific topic.</p>
<p id="p-253">So, for example, he's very knowledgeable about cookware.</p>
<p id="p-254">He has been keeping up with all the different brands.</p>
<p id="p-255">So, I suppose you could be maybe not super intelligent overall, but really knowledgeable about one area.</p>
<p id="p-256">And if that's the area that you go into professionally, you're good to go, right?</p>
<p id="p-257">Right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-258">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-259">And then Kate was also asking about, you know, somebody who's really smart with math or science specifically.</p>
<p id="p-260">So, I guess maybe a math, I mean, if they are really a mathematician or a scientist, right, those are the professions.</p>
<p id="p-261">But if you sometimes you might</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-262">But sometimes you might want to use them to highlight that they're good at something.</p>
<p id="p-263">So for example, you could use it in kind of a joking way.</p>
<p id="p-264">You could say, look at you, you're a real mathematician.</p>
<p id="p-265">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-266">Look at you, right?</p>
<p id="p-267">We must have done an episode at some point on that.</p>
<p id="p-268">Look at you, you are XYZ.</p>
<p id="p-269">Yeah, really good.</p>
<p id="p-270">Kind of teasing someone a little bit.</p>
<p id="p-271">That's fun.</p>
<p id="p-272">That's fun.</p>
<p id="p-273">Or you could say that you're proficient in something.</p>
<p id="p-274">So you could say you're proficient in math or science.</p>
<p id="p-275">So I'm proficient in math, but I don't feel as smart when it comes to history.</p>
<p id="p-276">Yeah, I think proficient in, it would be more commonly used in a job interview.</p>
<p id="p-277">You know, I'm proficient in certain coding languages, right?</p>
<p id="p-278">AI coding, that kind of thing.</p>
<p id="p-279">It feels a little formal for that kind of dinner conversation with in-laws.</p>
<p id="p-280">Don't you think so, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-281">Yeah, I would say.</p>
<p id="p-282">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-283">I would say it's a little bit more formal.</p>
<p id="p-284">But Lindsay, any other that you can think that is specific to math or science?</p>
<p id="p-285">I think we pretty much nailed the important ones.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-286">nail the important ones.</p>
<p id="p-287">Yeah, I think so too.</p>
<p id="p-288">Yeah, conceptual, cerebral, I've mentioned those words a few times, conceptual intelligence.</p>
<p id="p-289">He's very cerebral.</p>
<p id="p-290">Actually, my favorite brewery in my neighborhood is called Cerebral Brewing, and supposedly they use a lot of special science in brewing the darker beers that they create.</p>
<p id="p-291">I don't know if that's just part of their branding or what, but cerebral is a good word.</p>
<p id="p-292">So he's very head-focused, right?</p>
<p id="p-293">He's very active in his mind, his or her mind, that kind of thing could be other words to use.</p>
<p id="p-294">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-295">All right, should we do a role play?</p>
<p id="p-296">Let's do it, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-297">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-298">All right.</p>
<p id="p-299">I can't believe... Oh, sorry.</p>
<p id="p-300">Well, here we are college friends.</p>
<p id="p-301">What's the scenario?</p>
<p id="p-302">We're going over a test.</p>
<p id="p-303">All right.</p>
<p id="p-304">I can't believe I got a B. Lindsay, you're so smart.</p>
<p id="p-305">You'll catch up next test.</p>
<p id="p-306">I just don't feel very bright right now.</p>
<p id="p-307">You're one of the most intelligent people I know.</p>
<p id="p-308">You just had a couple bad breaks.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-309">I know, you just had a couple bad breaks.</p>
<p id="p-310">Well, thanks.</p>
<p id="p-311">I think I'm more proficient in math than science, so my grades reflect that.</p>
<p id="p-312">Well, I don't think our teacher is that great, to be honest.</p>
<p id="p-313">He may have a PhD, but being well-educated doesn't always translate into being a good classroom teacher.</p>
<p id="p-314">That's true.</p>
<p id="p-315">Oh, that is true.</p>
<p id="p-316">Sometimes, did you ever run into in college, especially because you went to a larger university, right, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-317">University of Maryland, yes.</p>
<p id="p-318">Right, so I imagine a lot of your professors were doing research.</p>
<p id="p-319">Is that true?</p>
<p id="p-320">Or at the same time, well, teaching?</p>
<p id="p-321">Yeah, but a lot of times, yes, that's true.</p>
<p id="p-322">A lot of professors, they're doing research as well and teaching.</p>
<p id="p-323">A lot of times, they are required to teach, but they're really there to research, to become really well-known in their field because they love their discipline, whatever they're researching, and then teaching is kind of a side gig for them in a lot of cases.</p>
<p id="p-324">You do run into that a lot of times in bigger universities, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-325">Yeah,</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-326">Yeah, So let's go through this.</p>
<p id="p-327">So I said, so you're upset you got a B and I said, you're so smart, you'll catch up next test.</p>
<p id="p-328">Right, And then I said, I just don't feel very bright right now.</p>
<p id="p-329">Right, And you said?</p>
<p id="p-330">I said, Lindsay, you're one of the most intelligent people I know.</p>
<p id="p-331">You just got a couple of bad breaks.</p>
<p id="p-332">Yeah, And then I said, well, thanks.</p>
<p id="p-333">I think I'm more proficient in math and science, so my grade reflects that.</p>
<p id="p-334">And that feels like a pretty formal statement right there, right?</p>
<p id="p-335">The word proficient for some reason is feeling formal today for me.</p>
<p id="p-336">No, I get it.</p>
<p id="p-337">I get it.</p>
<p id="p-338">It's good to point that out, definitely.</p>
<p id="p-339">And then I'm starting to trash talk the teacher.</p>
<p id="p-340">And I said, he may have a PhD, but being well-educated doesn't always translate into being a good classroom teacher.</p>
<p id="p-341">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-342">And we did go into this topic a little bit of a different direction in 2270.</p>
<p id="p-343">Are you book smart or are you street smart?</p>
<p id="p-344">And I believe we probably had a poll there too.</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p id="p-345">I believe we probably had a poll there too for that episode.</p>
<p id="p-346">So guys, go back and check out that episode.</p>
<p id="p-347">Find out the difference between book smart and street smart and tell us which one you are.</p>
<p id="p-348">That's always really interesting when we apply what we're learning to ourselves.</p>
<p id="p-349">Right, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-350">Oh, yeah, definitely.</p>
<p id="p-351">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-352">All right.</p>
<p id="p-353">Takeaway for today.</p>
<p id="p-354">Yeah, I mean, I think it's first of all, intelligence is we live in a culture that is obsessed with, again, cerebral conceptual intelligence.</p>
<p id="p-355">But there's a lot of ways to be smart in the world.</p>
<p id="p-356">There's a lot of niche things we can be smart in.</p>
<p id="p-357">So I would encourage our listeners to think beyond just as someone smart or not smart and think, how are they smart?</p>
<p id="p-358">And start to articulate that when you describe them to other people or when you talk with them.</p>
<p id="p-359">And some of this vocabulary will help you do that, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-360">Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-361">All right.</p>
<p id="p-362">Well, very well said, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-363">And guys, thank you so much for listening.</p>
<p id="p-364">Thanks to Kate for that great question.</p>
<p id="p-365">And we'll talk to you guys in the next one.</p>
<p id="p-366">All right, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-367">Bye.</p>
<p id="p-368">Bye.</p>
