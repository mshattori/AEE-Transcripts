<p>Hey there, Michelle, what's shaking?</p>
<p>Not too much, Lindsay.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>Fantastic, fantastic.</p>
<p>What are we getting into on All Ears English today?</p>
<p>Lindsay, who is the smartest person you know?</p>
<p>And don't say me, don't say me.</p>
<p>I know you want to.</p>
<p>Just joking.</p>
<p>Well, I think my brother's pretty smart, actually.</p>
<p>You know, he's pretty good.</p>
<p>You know, he's an engineer.</p>
<p>He's...</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>He's an engineer.</p>
<p>He's pretty smart, I would say.</p>
<p>What about you, Michelle?</p>
<p>That's funny.</p>
<p>I was going to say my brother's pretty smart, too.</p>
<p>Oh, weird.</p>
<p>I would never want him to hear this because I don't want him to know that I'm complimenting him.</p>
<p>Right, No, yeah.</p>
<p>No, he's a lawyer and he's one of those people, I don't know.</p>
<p>I always believe what he says.</p>
<p>He's your big brother, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>So I always feel like he has a really good sense about things.</p>
<p>That's good.</p>
<p>Yeah, It's good to have someone around who has a very good intuition about things and they can articulate it for you, but not in an overbearing way.</p>
<p>You can say, what do you think about this?</p>
<p>Just to get this outside opinion.</p>
<p>Really good.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, we're going to be talking about this more in a second.</p>
<p>But before we do, we want to say thank you so much to our reviewers.</p>
<p>Guys, we're so appreciative.</p>
<p>Right, Lindsay?</p>
<p>Yeah, we so appreciate.</p>
<p>Every time we read a new review,</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>Every time we read a new review, we just, we love it.</p>
<p>It just keeps us podcasting for you.</p>
<p>It keeps us happy.</p>
<p>We love to see that this show makes an impact on you.</p>
<p>That's what this is all about.</p>
<p>So a special thank you to our reviewer Anonymous on January 5th, left a five-star review and a special thank you to Mohamed Bala Ahmed on January 1st from the UAE, also left a five-star review.</p>
<p>Huge thank you to these listeners.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>We really appreciate it.</p>
<p>We do.</p>
<p>Lindsay, so we are going to get into the question today.</p>
<p>This is from Kate.</p>
<p>Do you want me to read the question for a change?</p>
<p>Sure, Michelle, go for it.</p>
<p>Read us the question, please.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This says, hello, AEE family.</p>
<p>Hope you all had a nice Thanksgiving with your family and friends.</p>
<p>So guys, this is from a little while ago.</p>
<p>But it says, I'd like to inquire about how you use this word smart in real life.</p>
<p>On Thanksgiving day, I met my American in-laws and</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>my American in-laws and they use smart very often.</p>
<p>I thought it was a compliment when they said it to me until I realized it was not a big deal because they also used that word for almost everyone.</p>
<p>That's funny.</p>
<p>That's really funny.</p>
<p>How would you describe people who are smart?</p>
<p>What are the characteristics of smart people and what's the difference between being smart and bright, well-educated or intelligent?</p>
<p>And which adjective is suitable for a person who excels at math or science specifically?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Best regards, Kate.</p>
<p>Great question, Kate.</p>
<p>And that's a funny scenario being in that situation, especially when you're learning a language.</p>
<p>You're in a place where you hear a word.</p>
<p>You think it's uniquely being spoken to you, but then you hear the person say it to everyone else in the room.</p>
<p>It's almost like a movie or something, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, there's actually a Seinfeld.</p>
<p>Yeah, that this reminds me of.</p>
<p>So anyway, Kate, this is a great question.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>Anyway, Kate, this is a great question.</p>
<p>So, oh my gosh, we have a lot to get into today.</p>
<p>Let's dive in.</p>
<p>So let's talk about smart first.</p>
<p>So to me, this is the most basic version, right?</p>
<p>And very, very common, which is probably why you hear them use it a lot.</p>
<p>Right, Lindsay?</p>
<p>Sure, yeah.</p>
<p>It's the most basic for sure, the most common.</p>
<p>It can also be used.</p>
<p>So obviously it can mean cerebral, conceptual intelligence, but it can mean other things too.</p>
<p>For example, you could look smart.</p>
<p>And I guess that could also mean two things.</p>
<p>Maybe you look studious or like a good student or something.</p>
<p>But more often, what, Michelle, when it comes to fashion?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, if you're using it to talk about fashion, it means you look good, right?</p>
<p>It's like, I wouldn't say it to someone wearing a ball gown.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>But, you know, if you just kind of look, it's the same idea.</p>
<p>You look sharp, right?</p>
<p>Sharp or smart.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>You look sharp, right?</p>
<p>Sharp or smart, yeah.</p>
<p>Like your shirt is tucked in, maybe things match, your clothes look clean and ironed, pressed, you look good, you look sharp, you look smart, okay?</p>
<p>So that's veering away from the idea of conceptual intelligence, right?</p>
<p>Right, interesting.</p>
<p>But it could be about this basic idea of just maybe it's about a specific topic.</p>
<p>So for example, I feel so smart when I get the right answers when I watch Jeopardy! Sure, yeah, you could hear people say that all the time, 100%. So I agree, Michelle, that the word smart is the more common way to articulate this concept, for sure.</p>
<p>Right, Lindsay, do you watch Jeopardy?</p>
<p>Jeopardy, I don't see it on TV much anymore.</p>
<p>I mean, I have flipped through the channels and it would be on.</p>
<p>Yeah, what about you, Michelle?</p>
<p>Are you a Jeopardy person?</p>
<p>There are people who watch Jeopardy every single day, you know?</p>
<p>My parents watch Jeopardy, not every single day, but they get into phases.</p>
<p>I think my brother-in-law watches it all</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>I think my brother-in-law watches it almost every day.</p>
<p>A lot of people, there are people who just, it's almost because I think it's kind of a comforting show because it's been on for so long.</p>
<p>I think it's one of those comfort shows.</p>
<p>But yeah, I don't watch it.</p>
<p>I watch it mostly when I'm with the people who watch it.</p>
<p>I remember my grandmother used to watch Wheel of Fortune every day.</p>
<p>She had her schedule.</p>
<p>It'd come on at like 4.30.</p>
<p>She'd turn the TV on for Wheel of Fortune.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's that comfort.</p>
<p>It's that comfort for sure.</p>
<p>But yeah, Smart is the most basic one.</p>
<p>I don't know why your in-laws were using it to describe everyone.</p>
<p>But I mean, I guess they're being very nice.</p>
<p>And take the compliment.</p>
<p>I'm sure they still mean it about you.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>I wouldn't take it personally either way.</p>
<p>I'd say in general, yeah, it can be intense, Kate, right?</p>
<p>Meeting your in-laws, especially if English is your second language and maybe they're native speakers of English.</p>
<p>That could be very intense.</p>
<p>But I wouldn't worry too much about...</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>but I wouldn't worry too much about that kind of scenario.</p>
<p>You can build the relationship with them in other ways.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>So let's go through some of the other ones Kate asked about.</p>
<p>Okay, bright, what do you think of this one, Lindsay?</p>
<p>So I think this maybe has a slight hint of a bit more energy to it.</p>
<p>Maybe a bit more of a youthful tone, I think.</p>
<p>Like maybe to describe younger people, I would say.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's probably not going to be found in the dictionary, but that's just the feeling I'm getting when I'm thinking about this.</p>
<p>For example, your example, Michelle, is about a child, right?</p>
<p>He's a very bright boy.</p>
<p>He just needs to apply himself more.</p>
<p>So it might be something that a teacher would say to parents in a parent-teacher conference.</p>
<p>Do you agree with that, with the youthfulness to that word a little bit?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>Well, to me, I also think of a light bulb, you know?</p>
<p>I think of the light bulb being bright, and so that's just kind of the image.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>The image I get with it is that, yeah, they know a lot.</p>
<p>I do agree.</p>
<p>I think there's a lot of energy youthfulness to this.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>There's some youthfulness.</p>
<p>I mean, it doesn't mean you can't refer to someone in their 70s as bright.</p>
<p>You could.</p>
<p>It would be correct.</p>
<p>But for some reason, we might just use this on the younger end of the spectrum for some reason.</p>
<p>Yeah, Okay.</p>
<p>All right, Michelle.</p>
<p>What else?</p>
<p>Well-educated.</p>
<p>Well-educated.</p>
<p>Yes, Okay, so Lindsay, what is this one?</p>
<p>This one is more to me about being studious or more dealing with school.</p>
<p>But what's interesting is you can be well-educated and not smart or smart but not well-educated.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Of course, 100%. 100%. Just because you've spent tons of money on education, which we would in the US, and years and years, it doesn't mean you've learned to think for yourself.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>To think in a critical way.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>in a critical way and to think in your own way.</p>
<p>A lot of what unfortunately the school system does, at least here in the US, teaches us a certain formula, a certain template of how to pass classes, right?</p>
<p>How to write a paper and cite citations and things like that.</p>
<p>But are we really learning how to think critically?</p>
<p>Not always, not always.</p>
<p>Right, and sometimes we're learning, a lot of times we're learning things that we don't actually need in the real world.</p>
<p>Like, you know, you never learn to balance a checkbook or about like your finances in school or how to unclog the toilet or, you know, things like that.</p>
<p>You know, you're learning, it's the whole, I think we've talked about book smart and street smart before.</p>
<p>It kind of goes back to that.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>And there's also other ways of being intelligent.</p>
<p>And, you know, I think that this is important.</p>
<p>Some people have uncanny emotional intelligence.</p>
<p>It's just unbelievable.</p>
<p>And 10 times out of 10, that's going to get them further in life than conceptual.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>than life than conceptual IQ intelligence, to be honest.</p>
<p>I would argue that that's probably more important in life to be successful is EQ.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So you want to read the example for this one?</p>
<p>Yeah, so here we go.</p>
<p>I don't care how well-educated she is, she doesn't know how to read people's emotions and it gets in the way of her work.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Just what you were saying.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>There's also other forms of intelligence like spiritual intelligence, like people who are very in touch with their body, with the earth, with, you know, there's just a lot of ways of being smart, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>It's not all like just if you pass your test.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Now let's go over to the word intelligent because we've been throwing it out there.</p>
<p>So this is to me overall about a person sounding a little more well-rounded.</p>
<p>It's not necessarily specific to one topic.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>pick to one topic.</p>
<p>It's more like a whole person or a whole animal.</p>
<p>For example, in this example is I've heard dolphins are very intelligent.</p>
<p>Does that make sense what I'm trying to say or is it just I'm confused?</p>
<p>No, I think it makes sense.</p>
<p>I've heard that also that elephants are, by the way, elephants are supposed to be really intelligent, which is really cool.</p>
<p>It's fun to know which animals are intelligent, you know, which animals have that sense and maybe build families, stick with their partners for life.</p>
<p>Penguins, for example.</p>
<p>Yeah, Really kind of cool stuff.</p>
<p>I actually don't know.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, dolphins are intelligent.</p>
<p>I was just making sure I didn't make that up.</p>
<p>I thought that they were.</p>
<p>I think you can also be really book smart but not have much common sense.</p>
<p>And I guess that is kind of street smarts, as we've said earlier in the episode.</p>
<p>But common sense is, again, kind of intuition about what should be done in this scenario or this scenario.</p>
<p>And in the end, yeah, these are all different ways of being smart.</p>
<p>But intelligent is, I agree with you, Michelle, it's more broad.</p>
<p>It's more well-rounded, I would say.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>It's more well-rounded, I would say.</p>
<p>Right, right, right, right.</p>
<p>Okay, anything else we need to know here about different ways to say smart?</p>
<p>Yes, well, we're going to talk about a couple different things before we wrap up the episode.</p>
<p>So, we're also going to add the word knowledgeable.</p>
<p>Knowledgeable, that's a big one.</p>
<p>Lindsay, what is knowledgeable?</p>
<p>Yeah, so generally just knowing a lot about a specific topic.</p>
<p>So, for example, he's very knowledgeable about cookware.</p>
<p>He has been keeping up with all the different brands.</p>
<p>So, I suppose you could be maybe not super intelligent overall, but really knowledgeable about one area.</p>
<p>And if that's the area that you go into professionally, you're good to go, right?</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And then Kate was also asking about, you know, somebody who's really smart with math or science specifically.</p>
<p>So, I guess maybe a math, I mean, if they are really a mathematician or a scientist, right, those are the professions.</p>
<p>But if you sometimes you might</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>But sometimes you might want to use them to highlight that they're good at something.</p>
<p>So for example, you could use it in kind of a joking way.</p>
<p>You could say, look at you, you're a real mathematician.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Look at you, right?</p>
<p>We must have done an episode at some point on that.</p>
<p>Look at you, you are XYZ.</p>
<p>Yeah, really good.</p>
<p>Kind of teasing someone a little bit.</p>
<p>That's fun.</p>
<p>That's fun.</p>
<p>Or you could say that you're proficient in something.</p>
<p>So you could say you're proficient in math or science.</p>
<p>So I'm proficient in math, but I don't feel as smart when it comes to history.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think proficient in, it would be more commonly used in a job interview.</p>
<p>You know, I'm proficient in certain coding languages, right?</p>
<p>AI coding, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>It feels a little formal for that kind of dinner conversation with in-laws.</p>
<p>Don't you think so, Michelle?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I would say it's a little bit more formal.</p>
<p>But Lindsay, any other that you can think that is specific to math or science?</p>
<p>I think we pretty much nailed the important ones.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>nail the important ones.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so too.</p>
<p>Yeah, conceptual, cerebral, I've mentioned those words a few times, conceptual intelligence.</p>
<p>He's very cerebral.</p>
<p>Actually, my favorite brewery in my neighborhood is called Cerebral Brewing, and supposedly they use a lot of special science in brewing the darker beers that they create.</p>
<p>I don't know if that's just part of their branding or what, but cerebral is a good word.</p>
<p>So he's very head-focused, right?</p>
<p>He's very active in his mind, his or her mind, that kind of thing could be other words to use.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>All right, should we do a role play?</p>
<p>Let's do it, Michelle.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I can't believe... Oh, sorry.</p>
<p>Well, here we are college friends.</p>
<p>What's the scenario?</p>
<p>We're going over a test.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I can't believe I got a B. Lindsay, you're so smart.</p>
<p>You'll catch up next test.</p>
<p>I just don't feel very bright right now.</p>
<p>You're one of the most intelligent people I know.</p>
<p>You just had a couple bad breaks.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>I know, you just had a couple bad breaks.</p>
<p>Well, thanks.</p>
<p>I think I'm more proficient in math than science, so my grades reflect that.</p>
<p>Well, I don't think our teacher is that great, to be honest.</p>
<p>He may have a PhD, but being well-educated doesn't always translate into being a good classroom teacher.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>Oh, that is true.</p>
<p>Sometimes, did you ever run into in college, especially because you went to a larger university, right, Michelle?</p>
<p>University of Maryland, yes.</p>
<p>Right, so I imagine a lot of your professors were doing research.</p>
<p>Is that true?</p>
<p>Or at the same time, well, teaching?</p>
<p>Yeah, but a lot of times, yes, that's true.</p>
<p>A lot of professors, they're doing research as well and teaching.</p>
<p>A lot of times, they are required to teach, but they're really there to research, to become really well-known in their field because they love their discipline, whatever they're researching, and then teaching is kind of a side gig for them in a lot of cases.</p>
<p>You do run into that a lot of times in bigger universities, for sure.</p>
<p>Yeah,</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p>Yeah, So let's go through this.</p>
<p>So I said, so you're upset you got a B and I said, you're so smart, you'll catch up next test.</p>
<p>Right, And then I said, I just don't feel very bright right now.</p>
<p>Right, And you said?</p>
<p>I said, Lindsay, you're one of the most intelligent people I know.</p>
<p>You just got a couple of bad breaks.</p>
<p>Yeah, And then I said, well, thanks.</p>
<p>I think I'm more proficient in math and science, so my grade reflects that.</p>
<p>And that feels like a pretty formal statement right there, right?</p>
<p>The word proficient for some reason is feeling formal today for me.</p>
<p>No, I get it.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>It's good to point that out, definitely.</p>
<p>And then I'm starting to trash talk the teacher.</p>
<p>And I said, he may have a PhD, but being well-educated doesn't always translate into being a good classroom teacher.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And we did go into this topic a little bit of a different direction in 2270.</p>
<p>Are you book smart or are you street smart?</p>
<p>And I believe we probably had a poll there too.</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p>I believe we probably had a poll there too for that episode.</p>
<p>So guys, go back and check out that episode.</p>
<p>Find out the difference between book smart and street smart and tell us which one you are.</p>
<p>That's always really interesting when we apply what we're learning to ourselves.</p>
<p>Right, Michelle?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Takeaway for today.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think it's first of all, intelligence is we live in a culture that is obsessed with, again, cerebral conceptual intelligence.</p>
<p>But there's a lot of ways to be smart in the world.</p>
<p>There's a lot of niche things we can be smart in.</p>
<p>So I would encourage our listeners to think beyond just as someone smart or not smart and think, how are they smart?</p>
<p>And start to articulate that when you describe them to other people or when you talk with them.</p>
<p>And some of this vocabulary will help you do that, Michelle.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, very well said, Lindsay.</p>
<p>And guys, thank you so much for listening.</p>
<p>Thanks to Kate for that great question.</p>
<p>And we'll talk to you guys in the next one.</p>
<p>All right, Michelle.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
