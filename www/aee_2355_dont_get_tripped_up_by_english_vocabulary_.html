<p>Hello, Aubrey.</p>
<p>How's it going today?</p>
<p>Happy Thursday.</p>
<p>We're recording today on a Thursday.</p>
<p>Happy Thursday to you.</p>
<p>I have a question for you, Lindsay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>When is the last time you tripped?</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>Oh my gosh, unfortunately I had a recent event.</p>
<p>My brother and my niece came to ski with us on Sunday and we had gotten all our stuff out of the car.</p>
<p>I was already feeling a little rushed and I also had this feeling that I kind of had to prove myself as a skier in front of my brother this particular time.</p>
<p>And we were stepping into the, just still in the parking lot, okay?</p>
<p>We're not even on the slopes yet.</p>
<p>We're still in the parking lot.</p>
<p>And I'm stepping onto the shuttle bus that is going to take us to the mountain.</p>
<p>I step in hard with my ski boot.</p>
<p>It's slippery, but yeah, I can handle it because I've done it many times, right?</p>
<p>I step in and somehow I catch my boot on the little yellow rubber thing that's sort of the ridge.</p>
<p>And I have never seen a more flailing fall in my life.</p>
<p>I do a lot of this, trying to save myself back and forth and I'm going to fall and I'm not going to fall.</p>
<p>All of a sudden I'm on my butt and I'm like intertwined with some guy's boot.</p>
<p>And it was</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>And it was one of the most embarrassing moments.</p>
<p>I almost started crying.</p>
<p>It was really, really bad.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my brother and my niece are like, what's going on with you?</p>
<p>They're just staring in shock.</p>
<p>He's like, are you going to stop the lift too?</p>
<p>I'm like, no, I'm actually a really good skier.</p>
<p>And so I don't know, it was so bad.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>In the parking lot.</p>
<p>Yes, and I tripped right on that little ridge.</p>
<p>Yeah, just be careful if you're stepping in with ski boots.</p>
<p>I have tripped getting on off of a ski lift.</p>
<p>I'm just like, I'm trying to get off and just fall.</p>
<p>Yeah, like on your out of the way so they don't have to stop the ski lift.</p>
<p>Oh, it's so bad.</p>
<p>Yeah, And when that happens, if you're a good skier and it happens, it's even worse.</p>
<p>It's like, okay, no, I could do better than this.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I'm better than this.</p>
<p>I know, right?</p>
<p>Well, I asked you about this.</p>
<p>I love that you have a very recent story because we got a great question about tripped.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>about tripped and all of the different ways we use it tripped up.</p>
<p>We use trip a lot in English, so I'm very excited to dive into this today, but make sure to hit follow guys.</p>
<p>If you're not following, we have five episodes every week and you're likely missing some of them if you don't follow the show.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love that we're starting with this episode too, Aubrey, with the physical concept of tripping and then we're going to extend today into what else that can mean in a more metaphorical way.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So this is from a YouTube subscriber, Basil Mohammed, 8431.</p>
<p>So thank you for leaving this comment on YouTube.</p>
<p>Do you want to read it for us, Lindsay?</p>
<p>Yes, here we go.</p>
<p>So Basil says, hi, Jessica, Aubrey, Michelle and Lindsay, the All Ears English folks.</p>
<p>You guys are doing a great job cheering us on through a journey of learning that's full of excitement, fun and a great sense of humor.</p>
<p>The thing that stimulates us to carry on our long learning practice.</p>
<p>Thank you a lot.</p>
<p>Well, thank you, Basil.</p>
<p>So much.</p>
<p>That's lovely.</p>
<p>So good to have you as a listener.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>so good to have you as a listener.</p>
<p>I recently come across an IELTS energy episode when I heard Aubrey say tripped up.</p>
<p>It's a very interesting phrase.</p>
<p>And after a little research, I see that there's not only tripped up, but also tripped over and sometimes trip off.</p>
<p>I'm no expert, but they pretty much sound the same, even from the overall context.</p>
<p>For instance, I could say, I'm terribly sorry.</p>
<p>I don't mean to trip you up or I tripped over my own feet and fell down the stairs.</p>
<p>The exact problem that I'm facing is in the usage.</p>
<p>How can I throw in this phrase succinctly when I'm speaking to someone else?</p>
<p>Would you please give us some information on the differences?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>Wishing you all the best and cheers.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Such a great specific question.</p>
<p>I love that Basil heard this on the IELTS Energy podcast.</p>
<p>If you're not subscribed or following, go and follow IELTS Energy as well, because a lot of great vocabulary comes up, even if you're not studying for IELTS.</p>
<p>100%. I love this.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>100%. I love this.</p>
<p>And this is a very native and natural way of up-leveling your vocabulary.</p>
<p>So we're going to show our listeners how to do it today.</p>
<p>So let's dive right in, Aubrey.</p>
<p>Where are we starting today?</p>
<p>Yeah, so we are going to share the three main ways that we use trip with phrasal verbs, trip up, trip over, and trip on.</p>
<p>And then we're going to do a great role play where you can see how we use all of these.</p>
<p>So the first one, you've heard this a lot.</p>
<p>Lindsay shared that physical tripping, but there are other phrasal verbs that have a very different meaning.</p>
<p>Yes, for sure.</p>
<p>So starting today with tripped up, right?</p>
<p>So this is not the physical version.</p>
<p>And we're going to come back to tripping physically in the next one.</p>
<p>But tripping up is really to make a mistake, right, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>On IELTS Energy, we do say this a lot when we're talking about how students get tripped up on the exam, right?</p>
<p>It can mean to make a mistake or cause to make a mistake.</p>
<p>We often say exam writers intentionally try</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>writers intentionally try to trip you up.</p>
<p>It's almost like they're trying to fool you, trying to make you miss answers.</p>
<p>Yeah, the tricks and the traps of the exam, right?</p>
<p>Aubrey, if our listeners are interested in learning about those tricks and traps, go over and subscribe.</p>
<p>Hit follow on the IELTS Energy podcast.</p>
<p>All right?</p>
<p>Yeah, so a couple examples here.</p>
<p>You might say, I got tripped up when the direction said head north and I went south.</p>
<p>So it just means I made a mistake.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Or daylight savings time often trips me up.</p>
<p>And a lot of people complain about this, right?</p>
<p>When we put the clocks forward and back and the first morning, they're tired.</p>
<p>Yes, you guys have definitely heard me mention this.</p>
<p>Daylight savings time definitely trips me up because Arizona doesn't change.</p>
<p>So I have to keep track of where the rest of the world is.</p>
<p>Very confusing.</p>
<p>Yeah, you're in a weird zone there where it ends up being quite complicated.</p>
<p>All right, so trip up just to kind of make a mistake, not physically making a fall or...</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>Not physically making a fall or anything like that, but just making a mistake, getting confused, falling into a trap of some sort, right?</p>
<p>And it is important that if you're talking about physically tripping, you wouldn't say, you know, I tripped up on the ski hill or when getting into the bus, right?</p>
<p>That only means making a mistake.</p>
<p>So keep track of the prepositions we add to these phrasal verbs.</p>
<p>It does change the meaning.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And this next one, now we're going back something similar to the example I shared about the bus, right?</p>
<p>Trip over something or trip on something.</p>
<p>We'll start with trip over.</p>
<p>Aubrey, what's this one?</p>
<p>Yeah, so trip over, it's physically like catching your foot on something and then either falling or almost falling.</p>
<p>So we wouldn't just say, oh, I tripped if it's, you know, if you're not talking about what you tripped on.</p>
<p>But you might say, I tripped over a log on the hike and twisted my ankle.</p>
<p>So we use tripped over when we're stating what it was that made us trip.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>that made us trip.</p>
<p>And we can also do this when it comes to speaking, and I love this use of it, right?</p>
<p>That's quite a tongue twister.</p>
<p>I keep tripping over my words, right?</p>
<p>And this can happen for sure when we just, it's like word salad or something that comes out, word vomit.</p>
<p>You guys hear us do this on the podcast, right?</p>
<p>The more you talk, the more you're likely to trip over your words every now and then.</p>
<p>I often, I'm like checking transcripts for keywords for the app and I'll hear us trip over our words in a funny way.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's always pretty entertaining.</p>
<p>I'm sure you guys hear us as well.</p>
<p>And we love showing our listeners that, right?</p>
<p>We really don't go back and edit these episodes of All Ears English or Business English because we want you to see that that's normal and that doesn't impede connection, right?</p>
<p>You can always connect even if you're tripping over your words, you're making mistakes.</p>
<p>This is how native speakers connect, all right?</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>But it's interesting to look at that sentence.</p>
<p>If we're going to say trip over, we'll still say what, even if it's not physical.</p>
<p>I tripped over my words, right?</p>
<p>So</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So when you use this one, trip over, you're going to state what it is that made you trip, either physically or metaphorically.</p>
<p>But I think it's also important to say you can just say, oh, I tripped and fell, right?</p>
<p>You don't have to say, obviously, if you're going to use a preposition like over on, then you need to say the thing that was in your way.</p>
<p>But I can just say, on Sunday it was so embarrassing, I tripped and fell on the bus and everyone stared at me.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>You can just use the verb trip by itself, I tripped.</p>
<p>But if you're going to say trip over, then you have to state what it was that you tripped over.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>And then we have one more physical tripping, right?</p>
<p>Yes, and Beisel had asked about trip off.</p>
<p>We don't actually use this, but we do use trip on.</p>
<p>So they might have heard trip on.</p>
<p>We might say, I tripped on the uneven sidewalk and almost fell.</p>
<p>So this is very interchangeable with trip over.</p>
<p>You're still going to state what you tripped on.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Or sometimes I trip on my</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Or sometimes I trip on my words if I speak too quickly.</p>
<p>So when we're talking about the same concept that we mentioned for trip over my words or trip on my words, both work here.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And I hear both.</p>
<p>I use both.</p>
<p>These really have the same meaning.</p>
<p>You don't have to think twice about should I say trip on or trip over?</p>
<p>Either works.</p>
<p>And I actually think this is a fantastic resource for our listeners.</p>
<p>If they are feeling like they're making mistakes and they're feeling awkward and they want to say something.</p>
<p>And that would actually boost your confidence by just going ahead and saying sorry, I'm tripping over my words here.</p>
<p>What I meant to say was X. Because you're inserting that high level expression, that could boost your confidence and get you back in the game.</p>
<p>That could probably work on IELTS too.</p>
<p>Yes, I love that idea actually.</p>
<p>And it does, it gives you a way to sort of diffuse any awkwardness.</p>
<p>And the native speakers do this as well, because we trip over our words as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love that idea of using a resource, not just being quiet or feeling embarrassed or I don't know, breaking eye contact.</p>
<p>Instead, you</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>breaking eye contact, instead you go to a vocabulary resource, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Okay, Aubrey, did we want to mention as a quick asterisk here, anything about the word tripping?</p>
<p>To trip.</p>
<p>Yes, you guys might be aware of this.</p>
<p>If not, we're going to share.</p>
<p>Often this verb or these phrasal verbs will be used for drug usage.</p>
<p>So people might say they are tripping on a drug or trip out is used to talk about someone who is experiencing the effects of a drug.</p>
<p>So when you hear the verb trip or tripping, just to be aware that that might be what someone is talking about.</p>
<p>All right, let's move into the role play, Aubrey.</p>
<p>So here we are classmates and you are wearing a cast on your leg.</p>
<p>So it looks like you broke your leg.</p>
<p>All right, you want to start us out?</p>
<p>Oh, what happened to your leg?</p>
<p>I tripped over a rock when I was hiking and fell and broke it.</p>
<p>Oh no, sorry to hear it.</p>
<p>It's so weird.</p>
<p>I feel like I've tripped on rocks a lot but never got injured.</p>
<p>Just bad luck, I guess.</p>
<p>How long do you have to have the cast?</p>
<p>Eight weeks.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>You have to have the cat.</p>
<p>Eight weeks.</p>
<p>Hey, by the way, were you able to complete the homework?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, a few of the questions tripped me up, but then I figured them out.</p>
<p>I had a hard time.</p>
<p>I may need to meet with the professor during her office hours.</p>
<p>Yeah, so a lot of different versions of tripping up here.</p>
<p>Tripping over, tripping on.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And you'll see I used trip over and trip on here, both with rocks, because these are very interchangeable.</p>
<p>We could switch these out.</p>
<p>I could have said, I tripped on a rock when I was hiking at the beginning, and then I feel like I've tripped over rocks, right?</p>
<p>Don't stress about which to use.</p>
<p>These have the exact same meaning.</p>
<p>They really do.</p>
<p>Trip on a rock, trip over a rock.</p>
<p>It's really the same thing.</p>
<p>So don't worry too much about that.</p>
<p>But for both of them, be sure to state what you tripped on or tripped over.</p>
<p>I couldn't just say, I've tripped on a lot, right?</p>
<p>So you got to leave the preposition off and just say, I trip.</p>
<p>I trip a lot, but this time.</p>
<p>Right, And like I said earlier, you could totally say, oh, I tripped when I was hiking.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>I tripped when I was hiking, and I fell and I broke my leg.</p>
<p>But if you're going to specify the item, you do need a preposition in there.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Then I said, yeah, a few of the questions tripped me up, but I figured them out.</p>
<p>You asked about the homework.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is the very different meaning of causing you to make a mistake, right?</p>
<p>Some of these questions really tripped me up.</p>
<p>That has nothing to do with physical tripping or tripping over our words.</p>
<p>It means they were difficult, they were confusing, or they caused me to make some errors.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love how practical this episode is and how our listeners are going to be able to go out there and just implement this right away.</p>
<p>This is so good.</p>
<p>Aubrey, is there another episode maybe on the Business English podcast that our listeners should check out?</p>
<p>Yes, we talk about phrasal verbs a lot, and there was an episode I want to make sure you guys caught on Business English.</p>
<p>It was 354, take on your workday with this English phrasal verb, all the ways we use take on at work.</p>
<p>So whether you work in English or not, we cover a lot of great vocab.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>We cover a lot of great vocab over there.</p>
<p>And you want to make sure to follow the Business English podcast as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So just go ahead and open your search bar wherever you're listening today.</p>
<p>Search for Business English.</p>
<p>You'll see the yellow come up and go ahead and hit the follow button on that show too.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Now, I think a great way to leave our listeners is what we said earlier is mistakes are inevitable.</p>
<p>They don't have to get in the way of human connection.</p>
<p>We believe connection is the most important thing.</p>
<p>And what can we do now, Aubrey, if we do make that mistake?</p>
<p>We have an option.</p>
<p>We have a resource.</p>
<p>I love that idea of not hiding from it or pretending it didn't happen.</p>
<p>State it, right?</p>
<p>Name it.</p>
<p>Be like, oh, I tripped over.</p>
<p>I'm tripping over my words.</p>
<p>What I meant to say was, and it diffuses awkwardness and is using impressive vocabulary.</p>
<p>And that builds confidence.</p>
<p>I mean, like I said, get yourself right back in the game by saying, wow, I just used a... Yeah, I made a mistake, but I didn't break the eye contact.</p>
<p>I didn't shy away or lose my energy or slump my shoulders.</p>
<p>I kept my shoulders back</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>my shoulders.</p>
<p>I kept my shoulders back, I maintained eye contact, and I used a cool idiom, expression.</p>
<p>Right, Whoever you're talking to is going to, first of all, not mind that you're tripping over your words and then be impressed by the vocabulary you're using.</p>
<p>The recovery.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>It's so good.</p>
<p>All right, Aubrey.</p>
