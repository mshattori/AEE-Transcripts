<p id="p-16">Hello, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-17">How's it going today?</p>
<p id="p-18">Happy Thursday.</p>
<p id="p-19">We're recording today on a Thursday.</p>
<p id="p-20">Happy Thursday to you.</p>
<p id="p-21">I have a question for you, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-22">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-23">When is the last time you tripped?</p>
<p id="p-24">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-25">Unfortunately, I have</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-26">Oh my gosh, unfortunately I had a recent event.</p>
<p id="p-27">My brother and my niece came to ski with us on Sunday and we had gotten all our stuff out of the car.</p>
<p id="p-28">I was already feeling a little rushed and I also had this feeling that I kind of had to prove myself as a skier in front of my brother this particular time.</p>
<p id="p-29">And we were stepping into the, just still in the parking lot, okay?</p>
<p id="p-30">We're not even on the slopes yet.</p>
<p id="p-31">We're still in the parking lot.</p>
<p id="p-32">And I'm stepping onto the shuttle bus that is going to take us to the mountain.</p>
<p id="p-33">I step in hard with my ski boot.</p>
<p id="p-34">It's slippery, but yeah, I can handle it because I've done it many times, right?</p>
<p id="p-35">I step in and somehow I catch my boot on the little yellow rubber thing that's sort of the ridge.</p>
<p id="p-36">And I have never seen a more flailing fall in my life.</p>
<p id="p-37">I do a lot of this, trying to save myself back and forth and I'm going to fall and I'm not going to fall.</p>
<p id="p-38">All of a sudden I'm on my butt and I'm like intertwined with some guy's boot.</p>
<p id="p-39">And it was</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-40">And it was one of the most embarrassing moments.</p>
<p id="p-41">I almost started crying.</p>
<p id="p-42">It was really, really bad.</p>
<p id="p-43">Meanwhile, my brother and my niece are like, what's going on with you?</p>
<p id="p-44">They're just staring in shock.</p>
<p id="p-45">He's like, are you going to stop the lift too?</p>
<p id="p-46">I'm like, no, I'm actually a really good skier.</p>
<p id="p-47">And so I don't know, it was so bad.</p>
<p id="p-48">Oh, wow.</p>
<p id="p-49">In the parking lot.</p>
<p id="p-50">Yes, and I tripped right on that little ridge.</p>
<p id="p-51">Yeah, just be careful if you're stepping in with ski boots.</p>
<p id="p-52">I have tripped getting on off of a ski lift.</p>
<p id="p-53">I'm just like, I'm trying to get off and just fall.</p>
<p id="p-54">Yeah, like on your out of the way so they don't have to stop the ski lift.</p>
<p id="p-55">Oh, it's so bad.</p>
<p id="p-56">Yeah, And when that happens, if you're a good skier and it happens, it's even worse.</p>
<p id="p-57">It's like, okay, no, I could do better than this.</p>
<p id="p-58">Right?</p>
<p id="p-59">I'm better than this.</p>
<p id="p-60">I know, right?</p>
<p id="p-61">Well, I asked you about this.</p>
<p id="p-62">I love that you have a very recent story because we got a great question about tripped.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-63">about tripped and all of the different ways we use it tripped up.</p>
<p id="p-64">We use trip a lot in English, so I'm very excited to dive into this today, but make sure to hit follow guys.</p>
<p id="p-65">If you're not following, we have five episodes every week and you're likely missing some of them if you don't follow the show.</p>
<p id="p-66">Yeah, I love that we're starting with this episode too, Aubrey, with the physical concept of tripping and then we're going to extend today into what else that can mean in a more metaphorical way.</p>
<p id="p-67">So good.</p>
<p id="p-68">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-69">So this is from a YouTube subscriber, Basil Mohammed, 8431.</p>
<p id="p-70">So thank you for leaving this comment on YouTube.</p>
<p id="p-71">Do you want to read it for us, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-72">Yes, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-73">So Basil says, hi, Jessica, Aubrey, Michelle and Lindsay, the All Ears English folks.</p>
<p id="p-74">You guys are doing a great job cheering us on through a journey of learning that's full of excitement, fun and a great sense of humor.</p>
<p id="p-75">The thing that stimulates us to carry on our long learning practice.</p>
<p id="p-76">Thank you a lot.</p>
<p id="p-77">Well, thank you, Basil.</p>
<p id="p-78">So much.</p>
<p id="p-79">That's lovely.</p>
<p id="p-80">So good to have you as a listener.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-81">so good to have you as a listener.</p>
<p id="p-82">I recently come across an IELTS energy episode when I heard Aubrey say tripped up.</p>
<p id="p-83">It's a very interesting phrase.</p>
<p id="p-84">And after a little research, I see that there's not only tripped up, but also tripped over and sometimes trip off.</p>
<p id="p-85">I'm no expert, but they pretty much sound the same, even from the overall context.</p>
<p id="p-86">For instance, I could say, I'm terribly sorry.</p>
<p id="p-87">I don't mean to trip you up or I tripped over my own feet and fell down the stairs.</p>
<p id="p-88">The exact problem that I'm facing is in the usage.</p>
<p id="p-89">How can I throw in this phrase succinctly when I'm speaking to someone else?</p>
<p id="p-90">Would you please give us some information on the differences?</p>
<p id="p-91">Thank you in advance.</p>
<p id="p-92">Wishing you all the best and cheers.</p>
<p id="p-93">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-94">Such a great specific question.</p>
<p id="p-95">I love that Basil heard this on the IELTS Energy podcast.</p>
<p id="p-96">If you're not subscribed or following, go and follow IELTS Energy as well, because a lot of great vocabulary comes up, even if you're not studying for IELTS.</p>
<p id="p-97">100%. I love this.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-98">100%. I love this.</p>
<p id="p-99">And this is a very native and natural way of up-leveling your vocabulary.</p>
<p id="p-100">So we're going to show our listeners how to do it today.</p>
<p id="p-101">So let's dive right in, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-102">Where are we starting today?</p>
<p id="p-103">Yeah, so we are going to share the three main ways that we use trip with phrasal verbs, trip up, trip over, and trip on.</p>
<p id="p-104">And then we're going to do a great role play where you can see how we use all of these.</p>
<p id="p-105">So the first one, you've heard this a lot.</p>
<p id="p-106">Lindsay shared that physical tripping, but there are other phrasal verbs that have a very different meaning.</p>
<p id="p-107">Yes, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-108">So starting today with tripped up, right?</p>
<p id="p-109">So this is not the physical version.</p>
<p id="p-110">And we're going to come back to tripping physically in the next one.</p>
<p id="p-111">But tripping up is really to make a mistake, right, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-112">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-113">On IELTS Energy, we do say this a lot when we're talking about how students get tripped up on the exam, right?</p>
<p id="p-114">It can mean to make a mistake or cause to make a mistake.</p>
<p id="p-115">We often say exam writers intentionally try</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-116">writers intentionally try to trip you up.</p>
<p id="p-117">It's almost like they're trying to fool you, trying to make you miss answers.</p>
<p id="p-118">Yeah, the tricks and the traps of the exam, right?</p>
<p id="p-119">Aubrey, if our listeners are interested in learning about those tricks and traps, go over and subscribe.</p>
<p id="p-120">Hit follow on the IELTS Energy podcast.</p>
<p id="p-121">All right?</p>
<p id="p-122">Yeah, so a couple examples here.</p>
<p id="p-123">You might say, I got tripped up when the direction said head north and I went south.</p>
<p id="p-124">So it just means I made a mistake.</p>
<p id="p-125">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-126">Or daylight savings time often trips me up.</p>
<p id="p-127">And a lot of people complain about this, right?</p>
<p id="p-128">When we put the clocks forward and back and the first morning, they're tired.</p>
<p id="p-129">Yes, you guys have definitely heard me mention this.</p>
<p id="p-130">Daylight savings time definitely trips me up because Arizona doesn't change.</p>
<p id="p-131">So I have to keep track of where the rest of the world is.</p>
<p id="p-132">Very confusing.</p>
<p id="p-133">Yeah, you're in a weird zone there where it ends up being quite complicated.</p>
<p id="p-134">All right, so trip up just to kind of make a mistake, not physically making a fall or...</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-135">Not physically making a fall or anything like that, but just making a mistake, getting confused, falling into a trap of some sort, right?</p>
<p id="p-136">And it is important that if you're talking about physically tripping, you wouldn't say, you know, I tripped up on the ski hill or when getting into the bus, right?</p>
<p id="p-137">That only means making a mistake.</p>
<p id="p-138">So keep track of the prepositions we add to these phrasal verbs.</p>
<p id="p-139">It does change the meaning.</p>
<p id="p-140">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-141">And this next one, now we're going back something similar to the example I shared about the bus, right?</p>
<p id="p-142">Trip over something or trip on something.</p>
<p id="p-143">We'll start with trip over.</p>
<p id="p-144">Aubrey, what's this one?</p>
<p id="p-145">Yeah, so trip over, it's physically like catching your foot on something and then either falling or almost falling.</p>
<p id="p-146">So we wouldn't just say, oh, I tripped if it's, you know, if you're not talking about what you tripped on.</p>
<p id="p-147">But you might say, I tripped over a log on the hike and twisted my ankle.</p>
<p id="p-148">So we use tripped over when we're stating what it was that made us trip.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-149">that made us trip.</p>
<p id="p-150">And we can also do this when it comes to speaking, and I love this use of it, right?</p>
<p id="p-151">That's quite a tongue twister.</p>
<p id="p-152">I keep tripping over my words, right?</p>
<p id="p-153">And this can happen for sure when we just, it's like word salad or something that comes out, word vomit.</p>
<p id="p-154">You guys hear us do this on the podcast, right?</p>
<p id="p-155">The more you talk, the more you're likely to trip over your words every now and then.</p>
<p id="p-156">I often, I'm like checking transcripts for keywords for the app and I'll hear us trip over our words in a funny way.</p>
<p id="p-157">Sometimes it's always pretty entertaining.</p>
<p id="p-158">I'm sure you guys hear us as well.</p>
<p id="p-159">And we love showing our listeners that, right?</p>
<p id="p-160">We really don't go back and edit these episodes of All Ears English or Business English because we want you to see that that's normal and that doesn't impede connection, right?</p>
<p id="p-161">You can always connect even if you're tripping over your words, you're making mistakes.</p>
<p id="p-162">This is how native speakers connect, all right?</p>
<p id="p-163">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-164">But it's interesting to look at that sentence.</p>
<p id="p-165">If we're going to say trip over, we'll still say what, even if it's not physical.</p>
<p id="p-166">I tripped over my words, right?</p>
<p id="p-167">So</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-168">Right?</p>
<p id="p-169">So when you use this one, trip over, you're going to state what it is that made you trip, either physically or metaphorically.</p>
<p id="p-170">But I think it's also important to say you can just say, oh, I tripped and fell, right?</p>
<p id="p-171">You don't have to say, obviously, if you're going to use a preposition like over on, then you need to say the thing that was in your way.</p>
<p id="p-172">But I can just say, on Sunday it was so embarrassing, I tripped and fell on the bus and everyone stared at me.</p>
<p id="p-173">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-174">Right?</p>
<p id="p-175">You can just use the verb trip by itself, I tripped.</p>
<p id="p-176">But if you're going to say trip over, then you have to state what it was that you tripped over.</p>
<p id="p-177">Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-178">And then we have one more physical tripping, right?</p>
<p id="p-179">Yes, and Beisel had asked about trip off.</p>
<p id="p-180">We don't actually use this, but we do use trip on.</p>
<p id="p-181">So they might have heard trip on.</p>
<p id="p-182">We might say, I tripped on the uneven sidewalk and almost fell.</p>
<p id="p-183">So this is very interchangeable with trip over.</p>
<p id="p-184">You're still going to state what you tripped on.</p>
<p id="p-185">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-186">Or sometimes I trip on my</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-187">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-188">Or sometimes I trip on my words if I speak too quickly.</p>
<p id="p-189">So when we're talking about the same concept that we mentioned for trip over my words or trip on my words, both work here.</p>
<p id="p-190">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-191">And I hear both.</p>
<p id="p-192">I use both.</p>
<p id="p-193">These really have the same meaning.</p>
<p id="p-194">You don't have to think twice about should I say trip on or trip over?</p>
<p id="p-195">Either works.</p>
<p id="p-196">And I actually think this is a fantastic resource for our listeners.</p>
<p id="p-197">If they are feeling like they're making mistakes and they're feeling awkward and they want to say something.</p>
<p id="p-198">And that would actually boost your confidence by just going ahead and saying sorry, I'm tripping over my words here.</p>
<p id="p-199">What I meant to say was X. Because you're inserting that high level expression, that could boost your confidence and get you back in the game.</p>
<p id="p-200">That could probably work on IELTS too.</p>
<p id="p-201">Yes, I love that idea actually.</p>
<p id="p-202">And it does, it gives you a way to sort of diffuse any awkwardness.</p>
<p id="p-203">And the native speakers do this as well, because we trip over our words as well.</p>
<p id="p-204">Yeah, I love that idea of using a resource, not just being quiet or feeling embarrassed or I don't know, breaking eye contact.</p>
<p id="p-205">Instead, you</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-206">breaking eye contact, instead you go to a vocabulary resource, right?</p>
<p id="p-207">Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-208">Okay, Aubrey, did we want to mention as a quick asterisk here, anything about the word tripping?</p>
<p id="p-209">To trip.</p>
<p id="p-210">Yes, you guys might be aware of this.</p>
<p id="p-211">If not, we're going to share.</p>
<p id="p-212">Often this verb or these phrasal verbs will be used for drug usage.</p>
<p id="p-213">So people might say they are tripping on a drug or trip out is used to talk about someone who is experiencing the effects of a drug.</p>
<p id="p-214">So when you hear the verb trip or tripping, just to be aware that that might be what someone is talking about.</p>
<p id="p-215">All right, let's move into the role play, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-216">So here we are classmates and you are wearing a cast on your leg.</p>
<p id="p-217">So it looks like you broke your leg.</p>
<p id="p-218">All right, you want to start us out?</p>
<p id="p-219">Oh, what happened to your leg?</p>
<p id="p-220">I tripped over a rock when I was hiking and fell and broke it.</p>
<p id="p-221">Oh no, sorry to hear it.</p>
<p id="p-222">It's so weird.</p>
<p id="p-223">I feel like I've tripped on rocks a lot but never got injured.</p>
<p id="p-224">Just bad luck, I guess.</p>
<p id="p-225">How long do you have to have the cast?</p>
<p id="p-226">Eight weeks.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-227">You have to have the cat.</p>
<p id="p-228">Eight weeks.</p>
<p id="p-229">Hey, by the way, were you able to complete the homework?</p>
<p id="p-230">Oh yeah, a few of the questions tripped me up, but then I figured them out.</p>
<p id="p-231">I had a hard time.</p>
<p id="p-232">I may need to meet with the professor during her office hours.</p>
<p id="p-233">Yeah, so a lot of different versions of tripping up here.</p>
<p id="p-234">Tripping over, tripping on.</p>
<p id="p-235">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-236">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-237">And you'll see I used trip over and trip on here, both with rocks, because these are very interchangeable.</p>
<p id="p-238">We could switch these out.</p>
<p id="p-239">I could have said, I tripped on a rock when I was hiking at the beginning, and then I feel like I've tripped over rocks, right?</p>
<p id="p-240">Don't stress about which to use.</p>
<p id="p-241">These have the exact same meaning.</p>
<p id="p-242">They really do.</p>
<p id="p-243">Trip on a rock, trip over a rock.</p>
<p id="p-244">It's really the same thing.</p>
<p id="p-245">So don't worry too much about that.</p>
<p id="p-246">But for both of them, be sure to state what you tripped on or tripped over.</p>
<p id="p-247">I couldn't just say, I've tripped on a lot, right?</p>
<p id="p-248">So you got to leave the preposition off and just say, I trip.</p>
<p id="p-249">I trip a lot, but this time.</p>
<p id="p-250">Right, And like I said earlier, you could totally say, oh, I tripped when I was hiking.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-251">I tripped when I was hiking, and I fell and I broke my leg.</p>
<p id="p-252">But if you're going to specify the item, you do need a preposition in there.</p>
<p id="p-253">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-254">Then I said, yeah, a few of the questions tripped me up, but I figured them out.</p>
<p id="p-255">You asked about the homework.</p>
<p id="p-256">Yeah, this is the very different meaning of causing you to make a mistake, right?</p>
<p id="p-257">Some of these questions really tripped me up.</p>
<p id="p-258">That has nothing to do with physical tripping or tripping over our words.</p>
<p id="p-259">It means they were difficult, they were confusing, or they caused me to make some errors.</p>
<p id="p-260">Yeah, I love how practical this episode is and how our listeners are going to be able to go out there and just implement this right away.</p>
<p id="p-261">This is so good.</p>
<p id="p-262">Aubrey, is there another episode maybe on the Business English podcast that our listeners should check out?</p>
<p id="p-263">Yes, we talk about phrasal verbs a lot, and there was an episode I want to make sure you guys caught on Business English.</p>
<p id="p-264">It was 354, take on your workday with this English phrasal verb, all the ways we use take on at work.</p>
<p id="p-265">So whether you work in English or not, we cover a lot of great vocab.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-266">We cover a lot of great vocab over there.</p>
<p id="p-267">And you want to make sure to follow the Business English podcast as well.</p>
<p id="p-268">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-269">So just go ahead and open your search bar wherever you're listening today.</p>
<p id="p-270">Search for Business English.</p>
<p id="p-271">You'll see the yellow come up and go ahead and hit the follow button on that show too.</p>
<p id="p-272">All right.</p>
<p id="p-273">Now, I think a great way to leave our listeners is what we said earlier is mistakes are inevitable.</p>
<p id="p-274">They don't have to get in the way of human connection.</p>
<p id="p-275">We believe connection is the most important thing.</p>
<p id="p-276">And what can we do now, Aubrey, if we do make that mistake?</p>
<p id="p-277">We have an option.</p>
<p id="p-278">We have a resource.</p>
<p id="p-279">I love that idea of not hiding from it or pretending it didn't happen.</p>
<p id="p-280">State it, right?</p>
<p id="p-281">Name it.</p>
<p id="p-282">Be like, oh, I tripped over.</p>
<p id="p-283">I'm tripping over my words.</p>
<p id="p-284">What I meant to say was, and it diffuses awkwardness and is using impressive vocabulary.</p>
