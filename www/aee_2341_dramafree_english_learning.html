<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p id="p-8">Do you tend to avoid confrontation and drama?</p>
<p id="p-9">Today get five ways to talk about drama and your style when you face it in English.</p>
<p id="p-10">Hello, how's it going, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-11">How are you today?</p>
<p id="p-12">Good.</p>
<p id="p-13">Yeah, I'm good, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-14">How are you?</p>
<p id="p-15">Fantastic.</p>
<p id="p-16">Fantastic.</p>
<p id="p-17">What are we getting into in All Ears English today?</p>
<p id="p-18">Yeah, So, Lindsay, how do you feel when there's some sort of drama with someone in your life?</p>
<p id="p-19">Do you ever find that drama happens to you?</p>
<p id="p-20">Yeah, sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-21">I try to stay away from drama, but it does happen.</p>
<p id="p-22">And it's awful.</p>
<p id="p-23">Yeah, it's not good.</p>
<p id="p-24">I don't feel good when there's drama.</p>
<p id="p-25">How about you, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-26">Oh, it can be very uncomfortable.</p>
<p id="p-27">I feel that it happened to me more with some of my college friendships and relationships.</p>
<p id="p-28">I remember, I mean, one of my good, really good friends in college, sometimes there would somehow be a little tiff or something like that.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-29">or something like that, and it just left me, especially when it's somebody you care about, it leaves you feeling like this terrible feeling in your stomach, right?</p>
<p id="p-30">You feel it.</p>
<p id="p-31">It's terrible.</p>
<p id="p-32">But honestly, now I feel that I don't have so much drama.</p>
<p id="p-33">Yeah, No, I know exactly what you're saying, and you kind of can't get it off your mind sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-34">Yes, 100%. Oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-35">Yes, Yeah, How does this tie into today's topic, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-36">So today we're going to talk about how to say that you don't like to have drama in your life.</p>
<p id="p-37">Maybe it makes you uncomfortable.</p>
<p id="p-38">This is really about describing yourself and your relationships, and so I'm excited to talk about this today because I have a feeling that all of our English listeners are relatively drama-free.</p>
<p id="p-39">What do you think, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-40">I would hope so.</p>
<p id="p-41">I would hope so.</p>
<p id="p-42">I would imagine.</p>
<p id="p-43">Yeah, I think to some extent you can choose whether to engage in drama or not, right?</p>
<p id="p-44">Some people choose more drama than others.</p>
<p id="p-45">Yeah, some people thrive on the drama, but that is true.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-46">Thrive on the drama, but that is not me and it sounds like it's not you either, right?</p>
<p id="p-47">No, no, no.</p>
<p id="p-48">All right, guys, we want to remind you to hit follow wherever you're listening to All Ears English so that you never miss anything from us.</p>
<p id="p-49">So if you haven't hit follow yet, wherever you are listening, make sure you take a second to press that button.</p>

<p id="p-51">Yes, you got three seconds.</p>
<p id="p-52">Press the button and make sure that All Ears English drops into your queue five days a week in the new year.</p>
<p id="p-53">All right.</p>
<p id="p-54">Yes, Good.</p>
<p id="p-55">Okay, Mishmell.</p>
<p id="p-56">So what's this about, really?</p>
<p id="p-57">I mean, if somebody does something wrong to you, you feel that someone has wronged you, do you run toward the issue or do you run away from it or try to ignore it?</p>
<p id="p-58">Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-59">Good question.</p>
<p id="p-60">Well, I guess somewhere in between, but I think I have a tendency to avoid if I can.</p>
<p id="p-61">If I can.</p>
<p id="p-62">I'll avoid it.</p>
<p id="p-63">Yeah, Would you say that you're a non confrontational person?</p>
<p id="p-64">What do you think?</p>
<p id="p-65">I would say so, Mishmell.</p>
<p id="p-66">Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, </p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-67">Yeah, that is my go-to way is that I kind of avoid the confrontation, but sometimes that ends up creating a bigger problem in the end.</p>
<p id="p-68">It's true.</p>
<p id="p-69">They say that couples who don't fight at all, I think, end up having more problems because they keep things, you know, pent up inside.</p>
<p id="p-70">So it's interesting because in some ways it's good to be non-confrontational, but you don't want to be a pushover, right?</p>
<p id="p-71">Right, So guys, non-confrontational is our word to start out with today, basically meaning you don't like to approach these situations.</p>
<p id="p-72">You don't run towards these situations.</p>
<p id="p-73">If something happens to you and you should maybe talk to someone about it, you're kind of like, oh.</p>
<p id="p-74">Yeah, So what's a sample sentence there?</p>
<p id="p-75">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-76">Here's a sample.</p>
<p id="p-77">I'm pretty non-confrontational, so I let a lot of things slide.</p>
<p id="p-78">Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, A lot of people are this way.</p>
<p id="p-79">I think we'll probably have an interesting-</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-80">are this way.</p>
<p id="p-81">I think we'll probably have an interesting poll at the end of the episode today to see how our listeners are by default, right?</p>
<p id="p-82">I'm looking forward to that.</p>
<p id="p-83">So stick around to the end on Spotify if you're listening over there.</p>
<p id="p-84">Michelle, what would be another phrase for our listeners?</p>
<p id="p-85">Okay, so this is a little longer, but it's very common.</p>
<p id="p-86">Stay away from the drama.</p>
<p id="p-87">So when we talk about the drama, I mean, when we talk about drama in general, we're talking really about plays and things like that, the drama.</p>
<p id="p-88">But when we use it in a different way, it really just means the conflict, basically.</p>
<p id="p-89">Some people thrive on that drama.</p>
<p id="p-90">They like it.</p>
<p id="p-91">It's interesting to them.</p>
<p id="p-92">Maybe they try and create it.</p>
<p id="p-93">But a lot of times, I mean, we could do a whole episode on this word.</p>
<p id="p-94">But yeah, so if you stay away from the drama, you don't get into that.</p>
<p id="p-95">So you could say, I try to stay away from the drama.</p>
<p id="p-96">It's not worth the stress.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-97">away from the drama.</p>
<p id="p-98">It's not worth the stress, in my opinion.</p>
<p id="p-99">Yes, and I agree with that because it does create a lot of stress for sure.</p>
<p id="p-100">And then that leads into the next phrase, Michelle, don't like to start trouble, right?</p>
<p id="p-101">So, for example, I should say something to her, but I don't like to start trouble.</p>
<p id="p-102">It just ends up being awkward for me.</p>
<p id="p-103">Ooh.</p>
<p id="p-104">Not good.</p>
<p id="p-105">Yeah, not good.</p>
<p id="p-106">Not good.</p>
<p id="p-107">All right, Michelle, we are back.</p>
<p id="p-108">What would be the next phrase for our listeners?</p>
<p id="p-109">Yeah, so we've talked about this one a little bit before, but this is pick your battles.</p>
<p id="p-110">So this one fits in in a little bit of a different way, right?</p>
<p id="p-111">This is how you decide if you want to confront somebody over something.</p>
<p id="p-112">So you might say, maybe somebody did something the first time and you say, I pick my battles, right?</p>
<p id="p-113">But if it happens over and over, then you have to think about it.</p>
<p id="p-114">You really have to pick and choose what is worth a confrontation.</p>
<p id="p-115">What is worth a little bit of drama?</p>
<p id="p-116">Oh, sure.</p>
<p id="p-117">And I bet as a mom, you have to do this too, right?</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-118">this too, right?</p>
<p id="p-119">When you decide if you're going to enforce a certain rule at certain times.</p>
<p id="p-120">I bet you're constantly picking your battles, right, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-121">Constantly.</p>
<p id="p-122">And as time goes on, I think, you know, and with two of them running around, I pick fewer and fewer battles because I just don't want to hear the whining.</p>
<p id="p-123">Yeah, that's understandable.</p>
<p id="p-124">That makes sense.</p>
<p id="p-125">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-126">I think pick your battles can also go for, even if you're not assuming it's going to lead to a fight, let's say as a manager, if a manager wants to open up a certain conversation around something or decides not to, that could be picking your battle.</p>
<p id="p-127">Even if it's not going to quote unquote be a battle, maybe it just will stir something up.</p>
<p id="p-128">This phrase works for that too in the business world, right?</p>
<p id="p-129">Yeah, Oh yeah.</p>
<p id="p-130">This is a really good one.</p>
<p id="p-131">So you could say, I decided a long time ago to pick my battles.</p>
<p id="p-132">Not everything is worth an argument.</p>
<p id="p-133">Yes, A hundred percent.</p>
<p id="p-134">Love that.</p>
<p id="p-135">All right, Michelle.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-136">Love that.</p>
<p id="p-137">All right, Michelle, what's another one?</p>
<p id="p-138">Let's do one more.</p>
<p id="p-139">So this is keep the peace, okay?</p>
<p id="p-140">So you could say, I think I'll just try to forget it.</p>
<p id="p-141">It's better to keep the peace.</p>
<p id="p-142">Yes, I love that.</p>
<p id="p-143">Be a peacekeeper.</p>
<p id="p-144">I think on the Enneagram, there is an actual, one of those numbers is the peacekeeper.</p>
<p id="p-145">Oh, is that right?</p>
<p id="p-146">What is your Enneagram personality, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-147">Do you know?</p>
<p id="p-148">I have no idea.</p>
<p id="p-149">No, you haven't done that before.</p>
<p id="p-150">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-151">No, I have no idea.</p>
<p id="p-152">What is yours?</p>
<p id="p-153">Type four.</p>
<p id="p-154">I'm a type four, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-155">You have to take the quiz.</p>
<p id="p-156">You'll have to take the quiz and come back.</p>
<p id="p-157">Okay, you have to show me where to go, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-158">We'll do an episode on that in 2025.</p>
<p id="p-159">I'm excited.</p>
<p id="p-160">Okay, good follow, guys.</p>
<p id="p-161">Yeah, what else, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-162">So, Lindsay, what's your philosophy?</p>
<p id="p-163">I mean, again, when deciding on a confrontation, do you think it depends more who it is or what it is or how many times things have happened?</p>
<p id="p-164">Like, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-165">Yeah, I think over the years, I've learned that it takes a lot out on you if you're always reacting.</p>
<p id="p-166">If you're always.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-167">always reacting.</p>
<p id="p-168">If every single thing you're letting get to you and you're reacting and you're blowing up, that is actually more harmful to you.</p>
<p id="p-169">So I do try to pick my battles more and more.</p>
<p id="p-170">And is something really worth it?</p>
<p id="p-171">Has something become kind of insidious and it needs to be stopped?</p>
<p id="p-172">Or is it just a harmless thing that wasn't meant in a certain way?</p>
<p id="p-173">And then I would just let it go in that case.</p>
<p id="p-174">Right, right, right.</p>
<p id="p-175">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-176">I think you have to think long term.</p>
<p id="p-177">Did somebody just say a slightly wrong thing?</p>
<p id="p-178">You also have to think about, and I think we've talked about this before, the intentions of the other person.</p>
<p id="p-179">I like to try and assume the best about someone and assume that if something happened, maybe it wasn't about me, maybe they were having a bad day, things like that.</p>
<p id="p-180">So just try and, I don't want to be a pushover, but I also just don't want to have drama flying at me all the time.</p>
<p id="p-181">And I've been pretty lucky recently that I don't knock on wood.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-182">I'll knock on wood.</p>
<p id="p-183">So... No, I think that's a great philosophy, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-184">That's the key to a happy life, right?</p>
<p id="p-185">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-186">So should we do a role play?</p>
<p id="p-187">Yeah, Let's do it.</p>
<p id="p-188">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-189">So here I am upset with my friend and I'm venting to you about this whole thing.</p>
<p id="p-190">And this person is a mutual friend.</p>
<p id="p-191">So we both know this person, right, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-192">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-193">Yes, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-194">I just can't believe she did that.</p>
<p id="p-195">Why don't you say something if you're upset?</p>
<p id="p-196">I like to stay away from the drama.</p>
<p id="p-197">I know you like to keep the peace, but it might be worth bringing it up.</p>
<p id="p-198">I'll pick my battles.</p>
<p id="p-199">It's not a big deal.</p>
<p id="p-200">But you said you were upset.</p>
<p id="p-201">I'm very non-confrontational.</p>
<p id="p-202">I don't like to start trouble.</p>
<p id="p-203">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-204">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-205">All right.</p>
<p id="p-206">So we used some of our phrases here in our role play.</p>
<p id="p-207">First of all, I said, I like to stay away from the drama when you asked me if I was going to do something, right?</p>
<p id="p-208">And I said, I know you like to keep the peace, but it might be worth bringing it up.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-209">but it might be worth bringing it up.</p>
<p id="p-210">So, you know, it sounds like we know each other pretty well.</p>
<p id="p-211">So we're really connecting over your patterns and, you know, it sounds like I know you, right?</p>
<p id="p-212">And this is the connection skill of today's episode.</p>
<p id="p-213">Right, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-214">You know, being able to articulate that you know that someone tends to do X when they might wanna try doing Y. Right, Right, So maybe I've noticed this pattern in you before and I'm like, oh, Lindsay, don't let somebody walk all over you, right?</p>
<p id="p-215">Yeah, and that's comforting to have people in your life that have seen that you have the history with them so they can bring that up to you and challenge you.</p>
<p id="p-216">Right, right.</p>
<p id="p-217">Okay, what else?</p>
<p id="p-218">Okay, then you said, I'll pick my battles.</p>
<p id="p-219">It's not a big deal.</p>
<p id="p-220">Yeah, and then you said, I know you like to keep the, oh, sorry, we already did that one.</p>
<p id="p-221">I'll pick my battles.</p>
<p id="p-222">And then I said, I'm very non-confrontational.</p>
<p id="p-223">I don't like to start trouble.</p>
<p id="p-224">But the truth is, it's gonna be bigger trouble.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-225">But the truth is, it's going to be bigger trouble later, right?</p>
<p id="p-226">Probably.</p>
<p id="p-227">Possibly.</p>
<p id="p-228">Yes, Yeah, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-229">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-230">So, but yeah, very good.</p>
<p id="p-231">So guys, also, I think we want to do for today's episode, we want to do a special Spotify poll, right, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-232">Yeah, I really think we should.</p>
<p id="p-233">Should we ask our listeners, what is their style?</p>
<p id="p-234">What should be our, what should be the poll for today, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-235">What we're going to wait and see.</p>
<p id="p-236">We're going to wait and see.</p>
<p id="p-237">Right, We're going to wait and see.</p>
<p id="p-238">And we are going to have a poll up for you and about your confrontation style.</p>
<p id="p-239">So let us know, definitely, if you're listening on Spotify, put that in and then we will get to actually tell you the answers on the air in a future episode.</p>
<p id="p-240">Sounds good, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-241">What's another episode our listeners could check out right now?</p>
<p id="p-242">Okay, guys, head on over to episode 2333 was vocabulary that is worth the trouble.</p>
<p id="p-243">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-244">And what's our takeaway?</p>
<p id="p-245">Where should we leave our listeners?</p>
<p id="p-246">Yeah, this is this is.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-247">Yeah, this is a huge connection skill.</p>
<p id="p-248">It's also good because it shows that you have knowledge about yourself.</p>
<p id="p-249">You've done some self-reflection, what type of person are you and why, but it also gives you that opportunity to share that with your friends or to have people notice things about you if they know you well.</p>
<p id="p-250">So what else do you think, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-251">Anything else you want to say?</p>
<p id="p-252">Yeah, I think that's just it.</p>
<p id="p-253">I mean, there's a great way to deepen a connection.</p>
<p id="p-254">If you're pretty good friends with someone and you want to deepen that connection, you could mention that you've been noticing.</p>
<p id="p-255">It could be a little bit of a risk in a friendship, but you could mention that you've been noticing certain things.</p>
<p id="p-256">That could bring a friendship to a next level potentially.</p>
<p id="p-257">So these are the places that you would need to do that, right?</p>
<p id="p-258">Or of course, describing yourself.</p>
<p id="p-259">It's always good to describe your go-to mode and who you are and how you deal with these situations.</p>
<p id="p-260">Very good.</p>
<p id="p-261">All right.</p>
<p id="p-262">Well, we wish you a very drama-free day and hope everything is peaceful in your life.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-263">Everything is peaceful in your life, and yeah, have a good one, guys.</p>
