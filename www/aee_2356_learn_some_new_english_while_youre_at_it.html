<p id="p-17">Hey there, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-18">How's it going today?</p>
<p id="p-19">Good, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-20">Lindsay, do you try to get multiple things done at once?</p>
<p id="p-21">Oh, I absolutely do, especially when I'm working online.</p>
<p id="p-22">If I have to wait, if the thing is, you know, the little wheel is moving, I have to go to another window and start something else.</p>
<p id="p-23">It's crazy.</p>
<p id="p-24">That's funny.</p>
<p id="p-25">Yeah, well, I'm</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-26">That's funny.</p>
<p id="p-27">Yeah, well, I'm glad to talk to you today.</p>
<p id="p-28">I mean, should we record a podcast episode while we're at it?</p>
<p id="p-29">I think we might as well, since we're on the phone.</p>
<p id="p-30">Hey, while we're chatting, while we're at it, let's do an episode too.</p>
<p id="p-31">Might as well.</p>
<p id="p-32">All right.</p>
<p id="p-33">Yes, might as well.</p>
<p id="p-34">All right.</p>
<p id="p-35">So today we are going to talk about a very useful expression used to talk about productivity in English.</p>
<p id="p-36">Yes, Lindsay, we just said it.</p>
<p id="p-37">What is it?</p>
<p id="p-38">We said it.</p>
<p id="p-39">The phrase is while we're at it.</p>
<p id="p-40">And I love that this came up in your real life, real English with your native speaking friends.</p>
<p id="p-41">What were you doing when this came up?</p>
<p id="p-42">I think my friend was talking to my daughter and she said, oh, should we take our shoes off while we're at it?</p>
<p id="p-43">Something like that.</p>
<p id="p-44">And I just realized that this was a very, I said, that's a good one.</p>
<p id="p-45">A lot of my recent episodes have come from this one friend speaking pattern.</p>
<p id="p-46">Oh, that's so funny.</p>
<p id="p-47">Does she know she's such a great source of ideas?</p>
<p id="p-48">I told her, I said, you've given me a few ideas today.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-49">given me a few ideas today.</p>
<p id="p-50">But it's true, they're all good.</p>
<p id="p-51">So I don't know, it's, you know, I don't walk into it.</p>
<p id="p-52">It's not like I walk into my conversations with my friends saying, okay, I'm listening for ideas.</p>
<p id="p-53">But when they come up, that would be creepy, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-54">That would be creepy if you did that.</p>
<p id="p-55">All right, I have my notepad, let's talk about it.</p>
<p id="p-56">No, it's just that sometimes all of a sudden I'll hear something.</p>
<p id="p-57">I think that's good.</p>
<p id="p-58">That's good.</p>
<p id="p-59">That's good.</p>
<p id="p-60">Yeah, So the most important thing for our listeners to know here, guys, is that this is real English coming directly from our conversations with our native speaking friends.</p>
<p id="p-61">So go ahead and hit that follow button.</p>
<p id="p-62">And while you're at it, leave us a review.</p>
<p id="p-63">Oh my gosh, I did not even think about that.</p>
<p id="p-64">Wait, you didn't? I didn't even think about that.</p>
<p id="p-65">That's hilarious.</p>
<p id="p-66">While you're at it, go ahead and leave us a review.</p>
<p id="p-67">Let us know what you think about this podcast, right?</p>
<p id="p-68">I want to call out Farubia, who left us a review on January 10th.</p>
<p id="p-69">And she or he said, love it, five stars.</p>
<p id="p-70">And then they said, without a shadow of a doubt, these girls are the best.</p>
<p id="p-71">Oh my gosh.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-72">girls are the best.</p>
<p id="p-73">Oh my gosh, Rochelle.</p>
<p id="p-74">That is fantastic.</p>
<p id="p-75">Very good English.</p>
<p id="p-76">Thank you so much.</p>
<p id="p-77">That's such a nice review.</p>
<p id="p-78">So go ahead and leave your review, everyone, to get your name announced on the show.</p>
<p id="p-79">So, Michelle, other than your friend who's giving us so many great ideas, we have to send her a thank you card.</p>
<p id="p-80">Do you find yourself using this expression a lot?</p>
<p id="p-81">Absolutely, and it sounds like you do too because you just used it.</p>
<p id="p-82">I swear, I did not even plan that.</p>
<p id="p-83">That's so funny.</p>
<p id="p-84">I thought you were just being zippy and let's go for it.</p>
<p id="p-85">Not zippy, not going for it.</p>
<p id="p-86">Yes, just natural.</p>
<p id="p-87">Yeah, I definitely use this.</p>
<p id="p-88">It's extremely useful.</p>
<p id="p-89">But what does it mean?</p>
<p id="p-90">While we're at it, while you're at it, what is it?</p>
<p id="p-91">Let's break it down.</p>
<p id="p-92">So it means while we're doing something, we might as well do something else, get something else done.</p>
<p id="p-93">And so what I said was go ahead and hit the follow button, and while you're at it, meaning while you're in your Apple Podcast app or your Spotify app, you might as well go ahead</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-94">Spotify app, you might as well go ahead and leave us a review.</p>
<p id="p-95">So while you're at it, leave us a review.</p>
<p id="p-96">Perfect.</p>
<p id="p-97">Right, It's convenient.</p>
<p id="p-98">So it would be a good idea.</p>
<p id="p-99">Okay, you have it open already.</p>
<p id="p-100">So it's usually out of convenience.</p>
<p id="p-101">And we've talked about that expression, kill two birds with one stone.</p>
<p id="p-102">It's kind of like that.</p>
<p id="p-103">But yeah, this one is to me is very in the moment or while making plans.</p>
<p id="p-104">So like our example in the beginning, imagine that we were just having a video chat anyway and figured we might as well record.</p>
<p id="p-105">I also just think, well, I like it more than two birds with one stone.</p>
<p id="p-106">Two birds with one stone feels violent.</p>
<p id="p-107">It feels like what I said naturally without even thinking about it at the top of the show.</p>
<p id="p-108">I never would have said, and if you want to kill two birds with one stone, go ahead and also leave us a review.</p>
<p id="p-109">It just isn't as common.</p>
<p id="p-110">It doesn't feel as natural.</p>
<p id="p-111">So this is a much better go-to option for our listeners, I think.</p>
<p id="p-112">Right, Right, And I believe that</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-113">Right, right.</p>
<p id="p-114">And I believe that we spoke about the other one and yeah, it's interesting.</p>
<p id="p-115">There are some things that we teach that are just going to be everyday, roll off the tongue kind of expressions.</p>
<p id="p-116">And this is one of them, whereas two birds with one stone is very useful and you'll hear it.</p>
<p id="p-117">It's a little bit more, you have to put a little bit more effort into it.</p>
<p id="p-118">It has more imagery.</p>
<p id="p-119">Yeah, and I think it also appears at a different place in the statement.</p>
<p id="p-120">I think that would tend to appear at the end, right?</p>
<p id="p-121">Hey, while we're in town, let's pick up some milk and also get gas.</p>
<p id="p-122">Kill two birds with one stone at the end, right?</p>
<p id="p-123">You're commenting on what you're doing, but while you're at it, I'm saying that kind of at the beginning, or it could also be at the end.</p>
<p id="p-124">Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p id="p-125">Right, right, right.</p>
<p id="p-126">And guys, while we're at it, I just want to let you know that we are going to do a Spotify poll later on in this episode.</p>
<p id="p-127">So guys, sometimes we interact with you by, well, we put out a poll on every</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-128">Well, we put out a poll on every day, but these ones, these special ones are ones that we share the results.</p>
<p id="p-129">So it's a great way to interact.</p>
<p id="p-130">So if you're listening on Spotify, you can answer this poll.</p>
<p id="p-131">So wait until further in the episode and we'll give you the question.</p>
<p id="p-132">All right.</p>
<p id="p-133">So should we do some examples to make this crystal clear for our listeners?</p>
<p id="p-134">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-135">So here we go.</p>
<p id="p-136">Here's one.</p>
<p id="p-137">Lindsay, could you pick up your shoes and move them off the carpet?</p>
<p id="p-138">And while you're at it, can you put your umbrella in the stand?</p>
<p id="p-139">Perfect.</p>
<p id="p-140">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-141">So while I'm at what, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-142">While I'm at the business of cleaning up things, moving my shoes, organizing, right?</p>
<p id="p-143">Right, I'm imagining you came in the door and you just kind of threw everything.</p>
<p id="p-144">And I'm, you know, saying, can you just pick those up?</p>
<p id="p-145">Yeah, And the concept of this, I find that people are one of two ways, right?</p>
<p id="p-146">And I hate it when people do this, they create buckets, but I'm doing it right now.</p>
<p id="p-147">People either like to piecemeal work, for example, cleaning.</p>
<p id="p-148">I think we've had this.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-149">For example, cleaning, I think we've had this conversation.</p>
<p id="p-150">Piecemeal cleaning, like a little every day, or they like to get it all done at once, maybe once a week.</p>
<p id="p-151">It sounds like, I think you mentioned before you're more of a piecemealer.</p>
<p id="p-152">Is that right, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-153">Yeah, and you are all at once.</p>
<p id="p-154">All at once, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-155">So while I'm taking out the trash, and while I'm at it, I want to clean the kitchen, clean the bathroom.</p>
<p id="p-156">I don't want to go back to this work every day.</p>
<p id="p-157">I just want it to be done for the week, and then I revisit it the next Sunday.</p>
<p id="p-158">So that's how this while you're at it kind of fits in.</p>
<p id="p-159">Do you piecemeal things, or do you do things all at once?</p>
<p id="p-160">What does piecemeal mean?</p>
<p id="p-161">Piecemeal is a great bonus for today.</p>
<p id="p-162">Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-163">Piecemeal means you do things in pieces.</p>
<p id="p-164">You do things in pieces, in phases, or you come back to it.</p>
<p id="p-165">But that's not who I am.</p>
<p id="p-166">Okay, excellent.</p>
<p id="p-167">All right, what's the next example, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-168">All right, so I could say, let's see.</p>
<p id="p-169">I could say, okay, first, let's wash our hands.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-170">Let's wash our hands.</p>
<p id="p-171">Oh, and wash the tomatoes while we're at it.</p>
<p id="p-172">Yeah, you got the sink on.</p>
<p id="p-173">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-174">What's another example, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-175">I'll boil the water and while I'm at it, I'll preheat the oven.</p>
<p id="p-176">Perfect.</p>
<p id="p-177">Yeah, so it just fits so naturally.</p>
<p id="p-178">And the other thing I love about this phrase, it's a good transition.</p>
<p id="p-179">So if you're taking IELTS and you're putting together a speaking answer, it's a really nice way to transition to ideas.</p>
<p id="p-180">It just brings your phrases together.</p>
<p id="p-181">Instead of saying, and next I'm going to, and then I'm going to, while I'm doing that, I'm going to.</p>
<p id="p-182">It's just natural, right?</p>
<p id="p-183">Very natural.</p>
<p id="p-184">All right.</p>
<p id="p-185">We have a few more examples to make sure our listeners 100% get this.</p>
<p id="p-186">All right.</p>
<p id="p-187">All right.</p>
<p id="p-188">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-189">Yes, go ahead.</p>
<p id="p-190">I did my cardio at the gym and I figured while I was at it, I should also lift weights.</p>
<p id="p-191">Oh, I love this because now we're seeing that we can do this in different tenses, right?</p>
<p id="p-192">Yes, Yes, exactly.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-193">So like, yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-194">So you're telling stories.</p>
<p id="p-195">I mean, this is just so versatile.</p>
<p id="p-196">It can be used for anything, I feel.</p>
<p id="p-197">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-198">I could see using it for the past tense.</p>
<p id="p-199">I wouldn't use it for the present perfect tense.</p>
<p id="p-200">I'd never hear, well, I've been at it.</p>
<p id="p-201">That doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p id="p-202">It doesn't make any sense either, right?</p>
<p id="p-203">No, not real.</p>
<p id="p-204">That's not, yeah, no, that's true.</p>
<p id="p-205">No, no, no.</p>
<p id="p-206">All right, one more example, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-207">All right, if you're gonna watch TV, at least fold some laundry while you're at it.</p>
<p id="p-208">Yeah, and you know, if you have teenagers or something, you're probably likely to say this to them, right?</p>
<p id="p-209">Right, yes, exactly, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-210">So yeah, to me, this expression sounds pretty light, pretty friendly, but I mean, in the wrong tone or in a nasty way, it could be on the, you know, more strict side, like that last example, at least fold some laundry while you're at it.</p>
<p id="p-211">That could be a little bit snarky, but I think with basic things, I think it's just very useful.</p>
<p id="p-212">What do you think, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-213">Yeah, I think it's really useful.</p>
<p id="p-214">I do hear it sometimes to snap at people if someone's</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-215">to snap at people.</p>
<p id="p-216">If someone's in a fight, maybe they'll say, oh, go, yo, get out of the house, and while you're at it, go pick up something.</p>
<p id="p-217">Maybe not a serious fight or something.</p>
<p id="p-218">But yeah, sure, it doesn't always have to be used in a positive tone.</p>
<p id="p-219">It could be in a more snarky or you're fighting with someone.</p>
<p id="p-220">It could work there too.</p>
<p id="p-221">Yes, So, let's talk about some other expressions.</p>
<p id="p-222">Now, we've been throwing this one around pretty naturally.</p>
<p id="p-223">I think you used it right at the beginning, and I thought, oh, I hope I put this one in the plans, and I did.</p>
<p id="p-224">What is it?</p>
<p id="p-225">Yeah, might as well.</p>
<p id="p-226">So, these mean very similar things, or you might hear them associated in the same statement, right?</p>
<p id="p-227">Might as well.</p>
<p id="p-228">Might as well do something.</p>
<p id="p-229">If you're going into the office anyway, you might as well do payroll while you're at it.</p>
<p id="p-230">So, yeah, it's not used instead of this.</p>
<p id="p-231">It's used in addition to this, right?</p>
<p id="p-232">Right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-233">These ones go along with it.</p>
<p id="p-234">So, this one also is a good one that goes along with it.</p>
<p id="p-235">It's why not</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-236">one that goes along with it.</p>
<p id="p-237">It's why not X? So it's your birthday.</p>
<p id="p-238">The cake is amazing.</p>
<p id="p-239">Why not take an extra slice while you're at it?</p>
<p id="p-240">Yes, Why not do this?</p>
<p id="p-241">It's just basically the idea here for today is this thing makes sense to do along with this other thing, right?</p>
<p id="p-242">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-243">Yes, Oh yeah, this is about productivity.</p>
<p id="p-244">And Lindsay, do we have a poll for today?</p>
<p id="p-245">So what's our Spotify poll?</p>
<p id="p-246">We do have a poll.</p>
<p id="p-247">So I think what we should do for a poll today is ask what came up in the conversation.</p>
<p id="p-248">Because this is really about what kind of person are you, right?</p>
<p id="p-249">So do you piecemeal tasks or do you prefer to get everything done at once?</p>
<p id="p-250">Everything done at once.</p>
<p id="p-251">Let's say for imagine in terms of cleaning, are you more like me?</p>
<p id="p-252">You want to clean once a week and do everything.</p>
<p id="p-253">Maybe it takes three hours, but you're done.</p>
<p id="p-254">No more cleaning.</p>
<p id="p-255">Or you're like Michelle, you want to do maybe, I don't know, 10 minutes every night, for example.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-256">Every night, for example, right?</p>
<p id="p-257">So are you a piecemealer or are you a get it done at once person?</p>
<p id="p-258">That is our poll for today, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-259">That is a good one.</p>
<p id="p-260">So guys, definitely answer that and then we will be giving you the results in a future episode.</p>
<p id="p-261">Yeah, and I also wonder if any of that is cultural too, right?</p>
<p id="p-262">Is it personality?</p>
<p id="p-263">Is it cultural?</p>
<p id="p-264">Is it just your productivity style?</p>
<p id="p-265">I mean, both ways are good.</p>
<p id="p-266">Both ways you get the work done, but how do you prefer to do it?</p>
<p id="p-267">Or another example, I don't like to get work done during the day and then go work out and then come back and work after that.</p>
<p id="p-268">I don't like to split it up like that.</p>
<p id="p-269">I would like to just get all the work done and then be totally done, go work out and just go hang out or something.</p>
<p id="p-270">Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p id="p-271">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-272">I mean, it's definitely nice to feel that sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p id="p-273">You completed your tasks instead of, oh, I have to go back and finish.</p>
<p id="p-274">But at the same time, sometimes I want to do that and then I just, my brain is...</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-275">I just my brain is I realize I'm wandering.</p>
<p id="p-276">I realize that I'll be more efficient if I actually do take a little break.</p>
<p id="p-277">But of course, it's more.</p>
<p id="p-278">I would rather get it done.</p>
<p id="p-279">No, it's so true.</p>
<p id="p-280">You can't. That's a good point, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-281">You can't force your way through it if the ideas just aren't coming.</p>
<p id="p-282">Sometimes you do actually need that air.</p>
<p id="p-283">Get out, go to the gym, maybe go out for dinner or something, and then come back and you have like a new brain.</p>
<p id="p-284">It's amazing.</p>
<p id="p-285">It is amazing.</p>
<p id="p-286">Yeah, So all right.</p>
<p id="p-287">So guys, definitely answer that poll.</p>
<p id="p-288">So let's do a role play and put this together.</p>
<p id="p-289">All right.</p>
<p id="p-290">So here we are, friends.</p>
<p id="p-291">We're building a DIY bookcase.</p>
<p id="p-292">Now, what is DIY?</p>
<p id="p-293">DIY is do it yourself.</p>
<p id="p-294">So this could be from Ikea or somewhere where we have to build our own bookcase.</p>
<p id="p-295">Oh, no, this never goes well for me.</p>
<p id="p-296">Never goes well either.</p>
<p id="p-297">Let's see how it goes today.</p>
<p id="p-298">All right.</p>
<p id="p-299">OK, so can you go in the other room and grab the instructions?</p>
<p id="p-300">Sure.</p>
<p id="p-301">Oh, and you might as well grab the hammer while you're at it.</p>
<p id="p-302">It's in that drawer.</p>
<p id="p-303">Oh, OK,</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-304">It's in that drawer.</p>
<p id="p-305">Okay, no problem.</p>
<p id="p-306">Oh, and why not get us a lemonade while you're at it?</p>
<p id="p-307">Anything else?</p>
<p id="p-308">No, that's it.</p>
<p id="p-309">So I was starting to get a little bit like, geez, Michelle, what's my next order?</p>
<p id="p-310">Yeah, do this and do that.</p>
<p id="p-311">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-312">So I asked you to go in the other room and grab the instructions, and you said sure.</p>
<p id="p-313">And so I said, oh, and you might as well grab the hammer while you're at it.</p>
<p id="p-314">So you're going in the other room anyway, so you might as well do this while you're at it.</p>
<p id="p-315">So again, those two expressions are used really a lot of times they're used together.</p>
<p id="p-316">Yes, I love that.</p>
<p id="p-317">Might as well, I agree.</p>
<p id="p-318">So again, they're not replacing each other necessarily, but they're associated with each other.</p>
<p id="p-319">And we can start talking about that more on the show too.</p>
<p id="p-320">Instead of replacement phrases, associated phrases.</p>
<p id="p-321">In the same context, in the same situation, that's a great way to learn new vocabulary.</p>
<p id="p-322">Right, yeah, it's funny.</p>
<p id="p-323">Yeah, because sometimes it's not always</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-324">It's funny, yeah, because sometimes it's not always, okay, what are multiple ways to use this, but what are some things that you'll hear around it?</p>
<p id="p-325">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-326">I love that idea.</p>
<p id="p-327">And then I said, oh, you said, oh, and why not get us a lemonade while you're at it?</p>
<p id="p-328">And now you're pushing the boundaries here.</p>
<p id="p-329">Now I'm pushing it, yes.</p>
<p id="p-330">So I used while you're at it twice.</p>
<p id="p-331">I might not do that, but exactly, just to give you another example.</p>
<p id="p-332">I mean, another thing you might say instead of while you're at it is why not get us a lemonade while you're out or while you're in the kitchen or while you're somewhere.</p>
<p id="p-333">While you're there, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-334">Your physical location, right?</p>
<p id="p-335">Right, right, right, right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-336">So we haven't even started building the bookcase.</p>
<p id="p-337">I'm not sure if this bookcase is going to get built, Masha.</p>
<p id="p-338">I'm not sure if I'm confident in this.</p>
<p id="p-339">Well, especially we haven't even started and I'm ready for my lemonade and yeah.</p>
<p id="p-340">I can tell who's in charge here.</p>
<p id="p-341">I don't seem very committed, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-342">I love it.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-343">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-344">So this is great.</p>
<p id="p-345">Michelle, is there another episode our listeners should check out right away when they finished this episode today?</p>
<p id="p-346">Yes, so we do have, this was episode 2326, was what do birds and efficiency have in common?</p>
<p id="p-347">So going back to that idea of the birds and the stones.</p>
<p id="p-348">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-349">And again, talking about efficiency today.</p>
<p id="p-350">What is your style?</p>
<p id="p-351">There are a lot of ways to get things done.</p>
<p id="p-352">And it just depends on how you want to design your life.</p>
<p id="p-353">So it's kind of cool, especially in the beginning of the year, to sit down and think about what is your efficiency style?</p>
<p id="p-354">Are there any adjustments we want to make for 2025?</p>
<p id="p-355">If you're a piecemealer, does that work well for you?</p>
<p id="p-356">Or do you want to become an all or nothing, all at once task, right?</p>
<p id="p-357">You know, someone who just gets these things done all at one time.</p>
<p id="p-358">So spend some time to reflect on how you get things done.</p>
<p id="p-359">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-360">Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p id="p-361">All right, guys, remember to check out that poll and thank you so much for listening today.</p>
<p id="p-362">All right, Michelle, you have a good one.</p>
<p id="p-363">I'll talk to you soon.</p>
