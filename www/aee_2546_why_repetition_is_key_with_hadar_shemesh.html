<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p id="p-10">Hadar, I am so excited to have you join us.</p>
<p id="p-11">How are you today?</p>
<p id="p-12">I'm amazing.</p>
<p id="p-13">So happy to be here and to talk to you.</p>
<p id="p-14">Thank you so much.</p>
<p id="p-15">Yes, welcome back.</p>
<p id="p-16">I know you've been on the podcast before and our listeners always love your episodes.</p>
<p id="p-17">So we're so excited to chat with you again.</p>
<p id="p-18">If you by chance haven't heard of Hadar, which I know is unlikely, I'll give a quick intro here.</p>
<p id="p-19">Hadar is an online entrepreneur, teacher, and content creator with over 4 million followers across all content platforms.</p>
<p id="p-20">She's trained teams in large global organizations such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, IBM, basically the biggest companies.</p>
<p id="p-21">And you've also worked with leading actors, singers, politicians, and public speakers in Israel, which is amazing.</p>
<p id="p-22">And this is exciting.</p>
<p id="p-23">Hadar has helped Google develop and design its pronunciation search tool that now serves millions of people around the world.</p>
<p id="p-24">I know we all use that.</p>
<p id="p-25">So this is amazing.</p>
<p id="p-26">And Hadar today is going to share three</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-27">is going to share three tips for why repetition is important and building speaking habits, how to make sure your practice is effective, which I know everyone out there listening, you are busy working individuals.</p>
<p id="p-28">You don't have a lot of time.</p>
<p id="p-29">You need to make sure every minute you're practicing is effective.</p>
<p id="p-30">So I'm so excited for these tips today, Hadar.</p>
<p id="p-31">Well, first of all, thank you so much.</p>
<p id="p-32">And thank you again for inviting me to speak.</p>
<p id="p-33">Definitely my favorite podcast to be on.</p>
<p id="p-34">And yes, so I want to talk about repetition.</p>
<p id="p-35">So even though I actually come from pronunciation, right, and that is the field that I teach and coach, what I'm going to share today is definitely relevant for every aspect of English, building grammar, building vocabulary, building fluency, and definitely pronunciation.</p>
<p id="p-36">I've learned it through the pronunciation work that I have done myself and that I've been teaching my students.</p>
<p id="p-37">And here is the thing about repetitions.</p>
<p id="p-38">And when people</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-39">thing about repetitions.</p>
<p id="p-40">And when people hear it, it feels like, oh yeah, like something that I need to do or something that might feel a little boring.</p>
<p id="p-41">But here is why it is so incredibly important.</p>
<p id="p-42">First, when we think about speaking, especially when we talk about pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary, it's important to remember that we are talking about building speaking habits.</p>
<p id="p-43">Habits are things that you do automatically without thinking about it.</p>
<p id="p-44">So when we think about our first language, when we think about words, we don't think about words before saying them.</p>
<p id="p-45">We don't think about grammatical structures before we use them.</p>
<p id="p-46">And this is why it's automatic.</p>
<p id="p-47">It's a habit.</p>
<p id="p-48">And when we learn a second language, we want to build the same habits so we wouldn't have to think about the grammatical structure or the words that we want to use and definitely not the sounds.</p>
<p id="p-49">Because once we start thinking about it, it kills fluency.</p>
<p id="p-50">There's no time for that, right?</p>
<p id="p-51">You're having a conversation with someone.</p>
<p id="p-52">You can't just sit and think of the grammar you want to use, the vocabulary you want to use.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-53">use the vocabulary you want to use.</p>
<p id="p-54">You're so right.</p>
<p id="p-55">And it takes you away from the conversation, you know, especially if you're in a test or you are in an important conversation, you don't want to be occupied with thinking about what to say.</p>
<p id="p-56">You want to be present.</p>
<p id="p-57">You want to respond to the other person.</p>
<p id="p-58">And this is why we want to build those habits.</p>
<p id="p-59">Now, when we think about habits in real life, right, how do you develop habits?</p>
<p id="p-60">How do you develop habits?</p>
<p id="p-61">Yeah, repetition, right?</p>
<p id="p-62">What is it that's like after four days, six days, what is it something becomes a habit?</p>
<p id="p-63">Maybe it takes a little longer, but if you do it once, it will never be a habit.</p>
<p id="p-64">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-65">Right?</p>
<p id="p-66">If you want to start going to the gym regularly, you can't just do it once and expect yourself to wake up the next day and be like, Okay, I work out.</p>
<p id="p-67">I have this healthy habit now.</p>
<p id="p-68">Right?</p>
<p id="p-69">I wish it were that easy, but it's not.</p>
<p id="p-70">So you have to do it again and again and again.</p>
<p id="p-71">And a lot of times it's really tedious and kind of like harder.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-72">and kind of like harder at the beginning until you turn it into a habit.</p>
<p id="p-73">So that concept needs to be adopted to this idea of building speaking habits.</p>
<p id="p-74">And repetition helps you build those habits so words become more automatic.</p>
<p id="p-75">Your grammar becomes more automatic.</p>
<p id="p-76">And your pronunciation becomes automatic.</p>
<p id="p-77">And that has to happen through repetition.</p>
<p id="p-78">So that is the first reason why repetition is important.</p>
<p id="p-79">Yeah, it's so true.</p>
<p id="p-80">It really makes sense when it comes to any habit.</p>
<p id="p-81">But as language learners ourselves, we have seen this, right?</p>
<p id="p-82">Nothing becomes part of our true active vocabulary unless we've repeated it multiple times and we've used it and we start becoming confident.</p>
<p id="p-83">Then we can immediately add it to our conversations.</p>
<p id="p-84">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-85">And that is why it's so important.</p>
<p id="p-86">And that leads me to the second thing that I want to say is that when it comes to practicing, and you and I both know that it's</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-87">We know that we're living such a busy life and our students don't have a lot of time to practice.</p>
<p id="p-88">They have very limited time, sometimes no time at all, and they still need to make progress.</p>
<p id="p-89">So what I've come to learn, while free speaking and practicing speaking with other people is critical.</p>
<p id="p-90">So we can't take that away.</p>
<p id="p-91">But if you only have 10 minutes a day, all right, and you want to build a habit of practicing daily, if you do repetitions, like drills where you're repeating certain grammatical structures or sounds or words.</p>
<p id="p-92">So you just practice repetitions.</p>
<p id="p-93">It's still super effective for a short amount of time.</p>
<p id="p-94">So what you get with a 10-minute practice drill is a lot more than what you were to get if you were just to speak freely.</p>
<p id="p-95">Now again, it's not instead, like we cannot replace it.</p>
<p id="p-96">But if you add repetition every day, drills, exercises, I call them a sprint.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-97">drills, exercises.</p>
<p id="p-98">I call them a sprint, so we create sprints for our students.</p>
<p id="p-99">So it's kind of like drills that you have every day for 10 minutes repeating words, phrases, sentences, grammatical structures.</p>
<p id="p-100">What happens is that you make those connections faster.</p>
<p id="p-101">So to be able to use those things, you want to build habits, you want to make connections in your brain, create new connections in your brain.</p>
<p id="p-102">And that is something that usually happens when you speak freely.</p>
<p id="p-103">But when you repeat it, it just happens faster.</p>
<p id="p-104">If you do it intentionally and then when you practice just the repetitions, you can be very intentional about what you're trying to achieve and how to do it.</p>
<p id="p-105">Let's say if you practice pronunciation, you can be mindful, something that doesn't happen so much when you're thinking about other things.</p>
<p id="p-106">So the practice, when you just practice drills and repetitions, is a lot more effective.</p>
<p id="p-107">So you get more for the time you invest.</p>
<p id="p-108">今年55歳になりました。今も現場の第一線ですね。まだまだ若い連中には負けていられない。</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-109">若い連中には負けていられないです。あなたも始めませんか?オートファジー習慣。ノーベル賞受賞から9年、さらに世界中から注目を集めるオートファジー研究に着目したサプリメント。今が一番かっこいいあなたへ。オートファジー習慣プラチナムで検索。ユハ味覚糖から。I love this metaphor to running, sprinting.</p>
<p id="p-110">Because just like for a runner, doing those sprints, maybe not the most fun thing you do, it is where the skills are built more quickly.</p>
<p id="p-111">And the same with conversations are more fun than the drilling, the practicing, but that is where the skills are built more quickly.</p>
<p id="p-112">And they work in conjunction.</p>
<p id="p-113">Like one is not going to progress as quickly without the other.</p>
<p id="p-114">And if you only have 10 minutes and you're not able to spend that speaking with someone, this is the best way you can spend that time.</p>
<p id="p-115">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-116">And it's a skill that you build.</p>
<p id="p-117">And, you know, I used to play the piano.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-118">And, you know, I used to play the piano.</p>
<p id="p-119">And as a child, I remember, like, always wanting to play those, you know, beautiful pieces, but I had to do the scales to train my hands to play the things that I wanted to play.</p>
<p id="p-120">And I remember... The scales are the worst.</p>
<p id="p-121">I'm right there with you.</p>
<p id="p-122">I played piano as a kid, and your teacher would tell you too bad.</p>
<p id="p-123">You have to do the scales.</p>
<p id="p-124">You have to do it.</p>
<p id="p-125">And when you listen to your teacher, you realize that you're building the skill of using your fingers.</p>
<p id="p-126">And that's the thing with pronunciation, with grammar, with vocabulary.</p>
<p id="p-127">The repetitions help you build the skill, make the connection, and then when you speak freely, it's there for you.</p>
<p id="p-128">Yes, Oh, this is so true.</p>
<p id="p-129">I'm very excited for any listeners who have sort of plateaued, and they're not sure why.</p>
<p id="p-130">They don't have a ton of time, but they feel like they're still listening to podcasts.</p>
<p id="p-131">There's still things that they're doing, but they're not seeing the progress.</p>
<p id="p-132">I feel like this could really be a game changer.</p>
<p id="p-133">This could make the difference for them to realize, I'm not really...</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-134">them to realize, I'm not really doing repetition with my vocabulary or my grammar, the things that I'm learning.</p>
<p id="p-135">I'm not being really proactive about that, and maybe that's what's missing.</p>
<p id="p-136">Yeah, and you learn a lot.</p>
<p id="p-137">So people learn, they get the passive knowledge, they don't turn it into active knowledge.</p>
<p id="p-138">So again, when you put it into practice and you learn a new word and you don't just keep it to yourself, but you just say it in different example sentences, then this is something that allows you to, like it makes it stick a lot longer than just trying to remember it, right?</p>
<p id="p-139">You build that.</p>
<p id="p-140">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-141">And just once won't be enough, just like one sprint wouldn't be enough for a runner.</p>
<p id="p-142">It's going to be multiple times and it's different for everyone.</p>
<p id="p-143">It might be more than you expect, but if you stick with it, don't give up on the word until you're using it in conversations really naturally and confidently, then you know it's part of your active vocabulary.</p>
<p id="p-144">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-145">Which leads me to the third tip that I want to share.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-146">The third tip that I want to share about repetitions, and that is it's a huge confidence builder.</p>
<p id="p-147">Because after all, we are creatures that are not just like we don't just have a brain that is a machine and that's it, right?</p>
<p id="p-148">We have feelings, we have emotions, we have, you know, thoughts about ourselves as speakers of English as a second language.</p>
<p id="p-149">And a huge part, a huge component of speaking freely and fluency is confidence, is the feeling that you can do something.</p>
<p id="p-150">And a lot of times we feel confident in things that we've already done, like we know how to do them.</p>
<p id="p-151">So for example, we have this list of words that we know how to say again and again, dog, house, yes, no, right?</p>
<p id="p-152">Like the very, very popular basic words.</p>
<p id="p-153">We're super confident about those.</p>
<p id="p-154">Super confident.</p>
<p id="p-155">No issues about those words.</p>
<p id="p-156">But then when it comes to more advanced grammar, more advanced vocabulary, more advanced...</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-157">advanced vocabulary, more advanced pronunciation.</p>
<p id="p-158">We don't have the confidence because we don't have a lot of experience using it.</p>
<p id="p-159">Again, it's because we're just learning it.</p>
<p id="p-160">We don't have a lot of experience practicing it.</p>
<p id="p-161">So the repetitions help you build confidence as if you've said it, you know, 10, 20 times already.</p>
<p id="p-162">So it makes you feel more comfortable using these new words.</p>
<p id="p-163">It makes you feel more confident knowing that you'll be able to say it because you've already proved to yourself that you can, right?</p>
<p id="p-164">By saying those sentences in the past perfect tense, in 10 of those sentences, and then you're like, oh, you know, something's clicking.</p>
<p id="p-165">Maybe I can try saying it when speaking spontaneously because you have experience saying it.</p>
<p id="p-166">You know that your mouth can produce these sentences, especially if it's new words or new sounds that we usually feel very embarrassed about saying them.</p>
<p id="p-167">So the repetitions is just like, oh, it's not just...</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-168">Petitions is just like, oh, it's not just in my head.</p>
<p id="p-169">I know how it feels.</p>
<p id="p-170">I know how to say it.</p>
<p id="p-171">I've said it.</p>
<p id="p-172">I can do it.</p>
<p id="p-173">It's just like one step further to trying and expanding in your English and your fluency and what you're capable of saying and doing.</p>
<p id="p-174">So I think that it's a huge confidence builder and it's a lot of fun because it's not too demanding, right?</p>
<p id="p-175">Like when you repeat phrases or when you do those drills.</p>
<p id="p-176">Right, This is so true.</p>
<p id="p-177">And we know this is what our students, our listeners want because when we ask you to share goals, this is often what we hear, to not build just fluency but confidence, to be able to speak more confidently.</p>
<p id="p-178">And that's the goal.</p>
<p id="p-179">But do you have the steps that it will take to get there?</p>
<p id="p-180">This is a big part of that, right?</p>
<p id="p-181">When you have done it, you have felt confident doing that, right?</p>
<p id="p-182">You're confident because you've done it before.</p>
<p id="p-183">You know you can do it.</p>
<p id="p-184">And people are like, they always want</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-185">And people are like, they always want to learn the next new thing.</p>
<p id="p-186">It's kind of like, how do I know more?</p>
<p id="p-187">But yeah, the more you know, and if you don't put it into practice, the bigger the gap is between the English that you know and the English that you speak.</p>
<p id="p-188">And at the end of the day, what helps you minimize that gap is you take all that passive knowledge that you have of English and you turn it into active.</p>
<p id="p-189">So again, repeating the things that you learn, repeating the words that you want to use but you never use is what's going to help you get there.</p>
<p id="p-190">So instead of just learning a whole bunch of new things, why don't we focus on what you already know and making it just a bit more accessible and I think that's like less work for more impact, which, you know, I love.</p>
<p id="p-191">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-192">I feel like today could be a real aha moment for our listeners.</p>
<p id="p-193">You may have been stuck.</p>
<p id="p-194">I'm so excited.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
