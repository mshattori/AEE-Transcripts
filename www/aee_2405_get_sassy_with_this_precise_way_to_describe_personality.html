<p id="p-22">Thank you.</p>
<p id="p-23">I am.</p>
<p id="p-24">Lindsay, do you know anyone who is sassy or sassy?</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-25">But sassy or sassy.</p>
<p id="p-26">Are you ever sassy?</p>
<p id="p-27">Oh, good question, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-28">So sassy, I can be a little sassy and push back with my family, kind of push back on them and challenge them a little bit, a little bit of an attitude, but not really with anyone else, to be honest.</p>
<p id="p-29">And I remember Sassy Magazine back in the 90s.</p>
<p id="p-30">Do you remember that?</p>
<p id="p-31">Sounds familiar.</p>
<p id="p-32">I don't remember it exactly.</p>
<p id="p-33">It was like one of those teen magazines, like 17 or like Teen Vogue or something.</p>
<p id="p-34">Oh, I loved that stuff.</p>
<p id="p-35">All the quizzes.</p>
<p id="p-36">Do you remember the quizzes?</p>
<p id="p-37">Oh, my gosh, those were just the best.</p>
<p id="p-38">We love quizzes.</p>
<p id="p-39">And we actually have a quiz right here at All Ears English.</p>
<p id="p-40">We know that we love quizzes.</p>
<p id="p-41">People love to know results about themselves.</p>
<p id="p-42">So guys, by the way, go over to allearsenglish.com slash fluency score to find out your English level.</p>
<p id="p-43">That's a quiz, right?</p>
<p id="p-44">There you go.</p>
<p id="p-45">Very nice.</p>
<p id="p-46">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-47">So, yeah, same for me.</p>
<p id="p-48">I think everybody tends to be a little bit different around their family.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-49">It tends to be a little bit different around their family.</p>
<p id="p-50">I can be a little bit sassy to my dad.</p>
<p id="p-51">I love my dad, but it happens.</p>
<p id="p-52">And then, you know, every once in a while, listen, we all have bad days, right?</p>
<p id="p-53">Things come out and then, but if ever I am sassy, I always feel so bad and I always have to apologize.</p>
<p id="p-54">Yeah, By the way, side point.</p>
<p id="p-55">I love how you said, listen, everyone has bad days.</p>
<p id="p-56">We should do another episode on listen and look, inserting listen and look before you say something, because I actually think it conveys confidence.</p>
<p id="p-57">And this is something I feel like I hear Obama say a lot and just certain leaders will say this as they explain something.</p>
<p id="p-58">So totally side point, but guys hit the follow button to make sure you don't miss that episode.</p>
<p id="p-59">Yeah, Look sounds very familiar to me, but it's even if we will do an updated episode.</p>
<p id="p-60">Yeah, we'll do it.</p>
<p id="p-61">That sounds like fun.</p>
<p id="p-62">All right.</p>
<p id="p-63">So look, no.</p>
<p id="p-64">So we're gonna look, Lindsay, there's an, as I listen.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-65">Look, Lindsey, there's a listener question.</p>
<p id="p-66">Look, Michelle, let's talk about sassy now.</p>
<p id="p-67">Let's talk about sassy.</p>
<p id="p-68">All right, so we're going to have some fun with this word today because our listener, Sophia, who asks amazing questions, asked us about it on YouTube.</p>
<p id="p-69">Oh my gosh, thank you to Sophia.</p>
<p id="p-70">Guys, you can get your questions and your name read out loud on the show if you send your specific question into support at allearsenglish.com.</p>
<p id="p-71">You can also put your question in YouTube, but the best way is to send it right to us.</p>
<p id="p-72">That will get it straight into our document in our queue.</p>
<p id="p-73">Michelle, I'm going to go ahead and read the question from Sophia.</p>
<p id="p-74">All right, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-75">Hi, Lindsey and Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-76">I'm Sophia and I absolutely love your energy and your podcast.</p>
<p id="p-77">Thank you.</p>
<p id="p-78">I've been looking up the word sassy, but most of the explanations I found online feel a bit abstract.</p>
<p id="p-79">Could you give some clear examples of how to use it in different contexts?</p>
<p id="p-80">Thanks a lot.</p>
<p id="p-81">Oh my gosh, she asked great questions.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-82">Oh my gosh, she asked great questions.</p>
<p id="p-83">I know.</p>
<p id="p-84">We love you, Sophia, really.</p>
<p id="p-85">I mean, the feeling is mutual.</p>
<p id="p-86">We love you too.</p>
<p id="p-87">Great.</p>
<p id="p-88">And actually, the feeling is mutual.</p>
<p id="p-89">I'm going to write that one down.</p>
<p id="p-90">We're coming up with lots of ideas today, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-91">Lots of ideas.</p>
<p id="p-92">It just happens like that.</p>
<p id="p-93">It's natural English.</p>
<p id="p-94">All right.</p>
<p id="p-95">So, Lindsay, so what does sassy mean?</p>
<p id="p-96">We've been throwing it out there willy-nilly.</p>
<p id="p-97">Yeah, So, sassy can have a positive or negative connotation.</p>
<p id="p-98">So, we really have to listen to the context when someone says this person is sassy or they act sassy.</p>
<p id="p-99">But it generally means that you respond to a situation or to a person with some kind of attitude, maybe an extra bit of confidence, boldness, challenging people.</p>
<p id="p-100">Maybe it's a little bit of negative attitude too.</p>
<p id="p-101">It's like on the edge.</p>
<p id="p-102">You're kind of on the edge, right?</p>
<p id="p-103">You're challenging.</p>
<p id="p-104">You're pushing boundaries.</p>
<p id="p-105">Right, right, right, right.</p>
<p id="p-106">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-107">And in the negative context, it kind of gives this idea of rudeness.</p>
<p id="p-108">So, for example</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-109">So for example, I don't think you need to be sassy with me.</p>
<p id="p-110">I just asked you a simple question.</p>
<p id="p-111">Yeah, the first thing that comes to mind is a teenager.</p>
<p id="p-112">And specifically, this is one thing that I struggle with in language.</p>
<p id="p-113">Well, what do you think, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-114">Is this used more to describe like women or men or both?</p>
<p id="p-115">What's your opinion being honest?</p>
<p id="p-116">Like when you think about saying someone is sassy, would that be that you describe a guy or a girl more often?</p>
<p id="p-117">Yeah, I would say more often it is used to describe a girl.</p>
<p id="p-118">And that's funny.</p>
<p id="p-119">I don't know if I wrote that later in the episode, but yeah, I definitely I was thinking about that too.</p>
<p id="p-120">And that's unfortunately, I think you hear it more in that way.</p>
<p id="p-121">Yeah, and that's a really important point to raise.</p>
<p id="p-122">I want to raise early in the episode.</p>
<p id="p-123">The word sassy has like a mixed connotation.</p>
<p id="p-124">It could be good.</p>
<p id="p-125">It could be bad.</p>
<p id="p-126">But I think the equivalent when we describe a guy would be</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-127">describe a guy would be confident or something that might have a more positive connotation.</p>
<p id="p-128">So I just want to throw that out there because I know our listeners are deep thinkers and gender is very much in language.</p>
<p id="p-129">So just think a little bit about that.</p>
<p id="p-130">What are the equivalents in your language and how are they gendered?</p>
<p id="p-131">And it's good to push back on these assumptions.</p>
<p id="p-132">And maybe we use this to refer to a guy to challenge the ways of thinking, you know?</p>
<p id="p-133">Yeah, I think it can be used about guys.</p>
<p id="p-134">And I think it is, but in more of, I don't know, kind of a jokey way, you know?</p>
<p id="p-135">Yeah, I think you're right.</p>
<p id="p-136">It's really interesting.</p>
<p id="p-137">It's really fascinating.</p>
<p id="p-138">So let's keep going.</p>
<p id="p-139">But I just want to raise that for our listeners to think about that throughout the episode.</p>
<p id="p-140">Like, who are we talking about here?</p>
<p id="p-141">Usually it's a woman, generally, okay?</p>
<p id="p-142">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-143">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-144">So here we go.</p>
<p id="p-145">Here's another example.</p>
<p id="p-146">My dog is a little bit sassy when she meets other dogs.</p>
<p id="p-147">She's more of a people dog.</p>
<p id="p-148">And see, I even chose a dog, a female dog.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-149">A dog, a female dog.</p>
<p id="p-150">Isn't that interesting?</p>
<p id="p-151">And the Fassy magazine was a teenage girl's magazine.</p>
<p id="p-152">Yeah, that's fascinating.</p>
<p id="p-153">You might just hear somebody say, don't be sassy.</p>
<p id="p-154">Don't be sassy with me.</p>
<p id="p-155">Right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-156">It's a great word though.</p>
<p id="p-157">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-158">So it doesn't always have to be a bad thing, right?</p>
<p id="p-159">It can mean confident, right?</p>
<p id="p-160">So knowing what you want, saying what you want.</p>
<p id="p-161">I love this coat on you.</p>
<p id="p-162">It's so sassy.</p>
<p id="p-163">What would that look like, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-164">Like, what would that coat, I mean, you know what I mean?</p>
<p id="p-165">It would be loud, probably a loud colors or just an interesting design, not just like a regular black coat, right?</p>
<p id="p-166">And maybe to give a little more context, it would be especially meaningful if that person maybe tends to wear more plain, like non-loud clothing.</p>
<p id="p-167">And then they put on this jacket and now it's really sassy on you because it's a counter to what you normally wear.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-168">A counter to what you normally wear.</p>
<p id="p-169">Right, Yeah, Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-170">And this is also interesting.</p>
<p id="p-171">And I did this kind of purposefully actually when I was planning it.</p>
<p id="p-172">So notice he's so fun and sassy.</p>
<p id="p-173">I love his whole vibe.</p>
<p id="p-174">So how I talked about sassy for a guy is a lot of the times used maybe sarcastically or just in a more of a positive way.</p>
<p id="p-175">Yeah, So I was thinking about that.</p>
<p id="p-176">Yeah, that's really interesting.</p>
<p id="p-177">Yeah, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-178">Wow.</p>
<p id="p-179">Language can be so incredibly profound if we really think about it on a deep level, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-180">Yeah, So again, we use this word to poke fun at someone, to show sarcasm, but it can be serious if someone is acting in a way that isn't pleasant, which we'll look at in just a second.</p>
<p id="p-181">Right, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-182">Yes, yes.</p>
<p id="p-183">あなたが大好きな物語も心を動かされた発明も思わず嫉妬したアイデアも</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-184">そしてアイデアも、すべて何もないところから始まった。真っさらな画面が静かに問いかける。あなたは何を思い描く?ひらめきはいつもMacから。詳しくはApple公式サイトで。OK、私たちは戻ってきました。では、他に何を知る必要がありますか?私はボッシーという言葉を持ち上げたかったのです。それはサッシーに似ています。また、ジェンダーの言葉ですよね。女性はボッシーであると言われることが多いです。そして、男性は同じように考えられません。例えば、ボッシーな女性は、ネガティブなことと考えられていました。そうですね。ボッシーな女性の同等は、自信のある男性や、</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-185">Or like a man who's in charge, right?</p>
<p id="p-186">There's gender all over this, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-187">Yeah, we want to push back on it and challenge it for sure.</p>
<p id="p-188">For sure.</p>
<p id="p-189">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-190">So bossy is another thing that people say.</p>
<p id="p-191">And then there's also another word you could use as feisty.</p>
<p id="p-192">Yeah, I love this word.</p>
<p id="p-193">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-194">How do you spell this?</p>
<p id="p-195">If our listeners don't, they should have the transcripts if they listen in the app with a premium membership.</p>
<p id="p-196">But if they don't, how do we spell it?</p>
<p id="p-197">F-E-I-S-T-Y. So not that intuitive, but it's pronounced feisty.</p>
<p id="p-198">Yeah, so here's an example.</p>
<p id="p-199">She's been kind of feisty lately.</p>
<p id="p-200">I think it's the group of friends she's hanging out with.</p>
<p id="p-201">Yeah, I mean, especially for like teenagers or younger people, we can be easily influenced by our circle, our social circle, right?</p>
<p id="p-202">So I could see this for sure.</p>
<p id="p-203">You say that maybe about your teenage son or daughter, just about their social group, right?</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-204">just about their social group.</p>
<p id="p-205">Right, right, right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-206">Another similar one, this is slightly different, but it's spunky.</p>
<p id="p-207">They are really spunky, such unique style, and just so confident.</p>
<p id="p-208">So this is less about attitude, and it's more about probably energy, don't you think?</p>
<p id="p-209">Yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe what they wear, how they act, just like a little bit different, kind of cool, right?</p>
<p id="p-210">Yeah, whereas sassy, on the other hand, is I think more of challenging people, someone challenges people, they push the boundaries, maybe they have an attitude.</p>
<p id="p-211">This is more like spunky is energetic and unique and confident and a little bit different, slight differences in meaning here.</p>
<p id="p-212">Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-213">Or think of sassy, do you ever call to make a doctor's appointment, and the person who answers the phone, and then you're kind of scared of them because they're not that nice, they might be a little sassy.</p>
<p id="p-214">Yeah, yeah, I'm trying to remember.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-215">Yeah, I'm trying to remember.</p>
<p id="p-216">Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-217">I think I had an interaction like that recently.</p>
<p id="p-218">But actually, you see a lot of it's interesting for New Yorkers.</p>
<p id="p-219">You see a lot of this in New York, but then it turns out that people are such kind-hearted people.</p>
<p id="p-220">They just appear sassy, right?</p>
<p id="p-221">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-222">Like the people where in your coffee shop or in Walgreens down the street or something.</p>
<p id="p-223">It's a New York thing.</p>
<p id="p-224">People are sassy.</p>
<p id="p-225">People are unapologetic.</p>
<p id="p-226">But if you actually have a conversation, they're the nicest people.</p>
<p id="p-227">Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p id="p-228">Yeah, Oh, I mean, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-229">You're a New Yorker.</p>
<p id="p-230">You know it, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-231">You know it.</p>
<p id="p-232">But I'm glad you brought up that word unapologetic because that is our next word.</p>
<p id="p-233">And that's a little different.</p>
<p id="p-234">And we could do a whole episode on that.</p>
<p id="p-235">But it's this idea of, you know, sometimes people might find you as being like too direct or they might even think you're sassy and you're just being unapologetic.</p>
<p id="p-236">You're not apologizing for anything.</p>
<p id="p-237">You're direct.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-238">You're not apologizing for anything, you're direct, right?</p>
<p id="p-239">Yes, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-240">So true.</p>
<p id="p-241">Unapologetic.</p>
<p id="p-242">You're direct.</p>
<p id="p-243">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-244">100% agree.</p>
<p id="p-245">So here's a sample sentence.</p>
<p id="p-246">He's not rude.</p>
<p id="p-247">He's just unapologetic when talking about what he expects.</p>
<p id="p-248">Yeah, And then we're going to do one more.</p>
<p id="p-249">And this one I think is one of the most common ones actually.</p>
<p id="p-250">And Lindsay, you kind of touched on it at the beginning, which was to have an attitude.</p>
<p id="p-251">So for example, sometimes he's nice, but he also has an attitude sometimes for no reason.</p>
<p id="p-252">Yeah, that can be quite disquieting, I guess is the word, or like destabilizing in terms of like when you talk to someone who's kind of up and down and you kind of know that how they're acting towards you isn't about you.</p>
<p id="p-253">They're a little unstable, like they're a little moody, but they kind of, I don't know, it's just it can be a little, I don't know, like awkward.</p>
<p id="p-254">Yeah, Not build confidence in the relationship.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-255">not build confidence in the relationship.</p>
<p id="p-256">Don't you think?</p>
<p id="p-257">Yeah, Yeah, it's scary.</p>
<p id="p-258">You don't want to be the person that people are afraid of, right?</p>
<p id="p-259">Or at least I don't. For sure.</p>
<p id="p-260">Yeah, But yeah, to have an attitude, you know, when you say somebody, I mean, because somebody can have a good attitude or a bad attitude, but if you say somebody has an attitude, it's a bad attitude.</p>
<p id="p-261">It's a bad attitude.</p>
<p id="p-262">Yeah, Yeah, The opposite of that.</p>
<p id="p-263">Hey, he has a great attitude about this, right?</p>
<p id="p-264">No, you have to put great in front of attitude.</p>
<p id="p-265">But if you say he has an attitude, it's bad.</p>
<p id="p-266">So that's interesting, too.</p>
<p id="p-267">So that's an important thing to note down.</p>
<p id="p-268">We've got a lot of good insights today, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-269">It is.</p>
<p id="p-270">So, Lindsay, so would you say overall sassy is more of a good thing to be called or not so good?</p>
<p id="p-271">I think these days it's a good thing because I think that society, well, let's see.</p>
<p id="p-272">Well, this is also cultural, too, right?</p>
<p id="p-273">So I think that in American culture, it's kind of good to be seen as someone</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-274">Good to be seen as someone that pushes back unless it becomes problematic and you can't get along with people.</p>
<p id="p-275">But a little sass is not a bad thing in my opinion.</p>
<p id="p-276">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-277">Yeah, I think so too.</p>
<p id="p-278">I mean, we don't want to be rude to people, but sassy in the context of confidence and being unapologetic, I think that's good.</p>
<p id="p-279">Yeah, we're a culture that really encourages being different, being unique, pushing back, like finding new frontiers in a way, kind of trying new trends.</p>
<p id="p-280">So sassy kind of gets pulled into that category a little bit, I think.</p>
<p id="p-281">Right, Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p id="p-282">I agree.</p>
<p id="p-283">All right, should we do a role play?</p>
<p id="p-284">Let's do it, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-285">So here we are, friends, talking about people we went to high school with.</p>
<p id="p-286">Oh, my best friend from high school just texted me the other week and she said our 25th anniversary is coming up this year or next fall.</p>
<p id="p-287">And she said, are we going?</p>
<p id="p-288">We should go.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-289">And she said, are we going?</p>
<p id="p-290">We should go.</p>
<p id="p-291">Let's go together.</p>
<p id="p-292">I'm like, maybe actually.</p>
<p id="p-293">It's been so long that it could be legitimately interesting.</p>
<p id="p-294">Right, Yeah, 5th and your 10th year, it's like, oh, it's too long.</p>
<p id="p-295">But 25th, is that right?</p>
<p id="p-296">I'm doing the math.</p>
<p id="p-297">It's right.</p>
<p id="p-298">I know I'm also thinking of mine.</p>
<p id="p-299">Yeah, So anyways, that will be interesting.</p>
<p id="p-300">I'll let you know if I go.</p>
<p id="p-301">I'll share stories.</p>
<p id="p-302">Oh, yeah, that would be interesting to talk about for sure.</p>
<p id="p-303">All right, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-304">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-305">You know who I ran into today?</p>
<p id="p-306">Who?</p>
<p id="p-307">Laura Jenkins.</p>
<p id="p-308">No way.</p>
<p id="p-309">Is she still as spunky as she used to be?</p>
<p id="p-310">Yes, I always loved her style.</p>
<p id="p-311">She's so unapologetic about what she wears.</p>
<p id="p-312">Yeah, I just didn't love her crowd.</p>
<p id="p-313">I always felt they had an attitude.</p>
<p id="p-314">Oh, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-315">Super clicky and rude.</p>
<p id="p-316">I remember when April got feisty with me when I wore the same outfit to the school dance.</p>
<p id="p-317">That was wild.</p>
<p id="p-318">She was always sassy.</p>
<p id="p-319">True.</p>
<p id="p-320">Yeah, that's a good example.</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p id="p-321">Yeah, that's a good example, describing a friend in high school that you didn't quite get along with.</p>
<p id="p-322">It was a little edgy, a little, you know, pushing the boundaries, maybe prickly, a little prickly, right?</p>
<p id="p-323">Okay, so what do we say here?</p>
<p id="p-324">So you saw Lara Jenkins, and I said, no, is she still as spunky as she used to be?</p>
<p id="p-325">So now you're saying, like, is she still as energetic and different?</p>
<p id="p-326">Yeah, like generally it sounds like we like Lara Jenkins.</p>
<p id="p-327">Right, right, right.</p>
<p id="p-328">And then I said, I always loved her style.</p>
<p id="p-329">She's so unapologetic about what she wears.</p>
<p id="p-330">So basically she's her true self, right?</p>
<p id="p-331">For sure.</p>
<p id="p-332">And then we said, yeah, I just didn't love her crowd.</p>
<p id="p-333">I always felt they had an attitude.</p>
<p id="p-334">So remember guys, we said bad attitude.</p>
<p id="p-335">When there's no bad or good, it's bad.</p>
<p id="p-336">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-337">And then I said, oh, for sure, super clicky and rude.</p>
<p id="p-338">And then I went to a story and said, I remember when April</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p id="p-339">went to a store, he said, I remember when April got feisty with me when I wore the same outfit to the school dance.</p>
<p id="p-340">So maybe she was a little rude and she was protective over her outfit.</p>
<p id="p-341">Yeah, and just so we're clear, what you're saying here is you wore the same outfit as her to the school dance, but we don't have to have as her in there in casual conversation.</p>
<p id="p-342">We assume that, but I just wanna make sure that context is clear.</p>
<p id="p-343">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-344">Good point.</p>
<p id="p-345">Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-346">And then I said, yeah, that was wild.</p>
<p id="p-347">She was always sassy.</p>
<p id="p-348">And here's where she always had a little bit of an attitude, right?</p>
<p id="p-349">A little bit of an attitude.</p>
<p id="p-350">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-351">Okay, super interesting.</p>
<p id="p-352">Michelle, another episode our listeners could check out.</p>
<p id="p-353">Guys, go to 2396, What Gives?</p>
<p id="p-354">English vocabulary for expressing surprise, which would tie into when you're talking about people's attitude, people's personality, it ties in nicely, okay?</p>
<p id="p-355">Yep, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-356">Definitely a good one to check out.</p>
<p id="p-357">So yeah, takeaway from today.</p>
<p id="p-358">We talked about a lot here.</p>
<p id="p-359">I mean, we talked about how these words sound, how sassy could...</p>
<h2>Part-21</h2>
<p id="p-360">how these words sound, how sassy can be good, how it can be bad.</p>
<p id="p-361">We talked about gender.</p>
<p id="p-362">Culture.</p>
<p id="p-363">Yeah, culture.</p>
<p id="p-364">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-365">We went into a lot today.</p>
<p id="p-366">But yeah, we hope that nobody gives you an attitude.</p>
<p id="p-367">Yeah, and I think what would be interesting is a little assignment for our listeners.</p>
<p id="p-368">Guys, start a conversation with someone from a different culture about what is the equivalent of this word sassy in your culture?</p>
<p id="p-369">And is it gendered?</p>
<p id="p-370">First of all, is it gendered?</p>
<p id="p-371">Is it respected in your culture or is it not respected?</p>
<p id="p-372">Because I have a feeling the answers are going to be different depending on where you're from.</p>
<p id="p-373">And what does that mean about your culture?</p>
<p id="p-374">Super interesting.</p>
<p id="p-375">Yeah, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-376">All right, Lindsay, thanks for leaving us with that.</p>
<p id="p-377">Very interesting.</p>
