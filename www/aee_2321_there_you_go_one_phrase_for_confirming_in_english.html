<p>Hello, Aubrey.</p>
<p>How are you doing today?</p>
<p>I'm great, Lindsay.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>Aubrey, I have a question for you because we are following up on your commitment.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>are following up on your commitment that you made here on the podcast recently and I think our listeners heard it.</p>
<p>So we're all going to ask.</p>
<p>Okay, let's hear it.</p>
<p>So Aubrey, have you been charging your phone outside of the bedroom, outside of your bedroom?</p>
<p>Yes, I have and it has been helping.</p>
<p>I am sleeping better.</p>
<p>Well, there you go.</p>
<p>Nice job.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I don't do it every night, but the nights that I do, I definitely notice a difference, right?</p>
<p>I'll take a little while to fall back to sleep at 2 a.m. when I wake up, but at least I don't have my phone there to pick up and start reading the news or something.</p>
<p>Yes, no, I'm telling you it's worked for me.</p>
<p>I mean, it's helped for sure.</p>
<p>It is helping.</p>
<p>So yes, thank you for the advice.</p>
<p>Good, yes.</p>
<p>Little hacks in life that can really help.</p>
<p>But I wonder if our listeners noticed what I said there at the end.</p>
<p>What did I say, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yeah, after I said, yes, it's helping.</p>
<p>I'm sleeping better.</p>
<p>Then you said, well, there you go.</p>
<p>And this is such a native, natural way to...</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>a native natural way to confirm and encourage.</p>
<p>We use it a few different ways.</p>
<p>We got a great question about this phrase.</p>
<p>How, yeah, go ahead.</p>
<p>Yeah, how do you say, there you go.</p>
<p>How and why and when and what does it do?</p>
<p>What's the vibe, right?</p>
<p>And I love it when we get these natural questions from our listeners.</p>
<p>Clearly, Jason has been listening to native English somewhere and getting it, absorbing it, right?</p>
<p>Love that.</p>
<p>Absolutely, yes.</p>
<p>And he left us five stars.</p>
<p>So thank you, Jason in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Do you want to read the question for us, Lindsay?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So Jason says, thank you so much for creating such a fantastic podcast.</p>
<p>Your lessons have really helped me improve my English.</p>
<p>Well, that is great to hear, Jason.</p>
<p>Bring your friends.</p>
<p>Yes, Love it.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have a question.</p>
<p>I often hear people say, there you go, but I find it hard to understand its exact meaning or how to use it in different situations.</p>
<p>Could you explain the various ways there you go is used in English?</p>
<p>I'd love to learn more about it from you.</p>
<p>Best, Jason from Taiwan.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>you.</p>
<p>Best, Jason from Taiwan reviewed us in Apple Podcasts.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Yes, thank you, Jason, for the review and for the kind words.</p>
<p>Thank you, everyone who leaves us a review.</p>
<p>We read them.</p>
<p>We really appreciate them.</p>
<p>Yes, we love seeing what you guys think about the show.</p>
<p>It keeps us motivated to keep going.</p>
<p>So thank you.</p>
<p>Yes, Okay, Aubrey, let's break it down.</p>
<p>Let's answer Jason's question directly.</p>
<p>Yes, So we use this expression, there you go, three different ways, and all of them are expressing confirmation of something.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So the first one we'll dive into here is probably the most common.</p>
<p>It's said when giving someone something, right?</p>
<p>It's usually after a request for it.</p>
<p>So it kind of means like, here's what you asked for, or here's what you ordered.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So that one is the most straightforward, for sure, the most physical one, right?</p>
<p>So for example, you give someone a book they had asked for and you say, here you go, or sorry, well, we have</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>here you go, or sorry, well, there are two things.</p>
<p>There you go, right?</p>
<p>There you go, or here you go.</p>
<p>What is the difference between those two, by the way?</p>
<p>Is there any?</p>
<p>No difference.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say they're interchangeable.</p>
<p>They mean the same thing.</p>
<p>I'm glad you said this other one because we use both, right?</p>
<p>We'll say here you go, or there you go.</p>
<p>Yeah, No, there's really no difference.</p>
<p>The one difference I would say, I think there you go is more often something's been requested and we're sort of saying like, here's what you ordered.</p>
<p>Whereas here you go, could be you're just giving them something, whether they asked for it or not.</p>
<p>You might then need to explain why you're giving it to them, but there isn't sort of this implied request that has been made.</p>
<p>Yeah, But I think a lot of the time you can get away with both, most of the time.</p>
<p>It's very, very subtle.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>So there you go, physically handing over something.</p>
<p>Yeah, Or maybe a server, if they're giving you your food, they might say, there you go.</p>
<p>And then they just set the plate down, right?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So yeah, as you</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So yeah, as you said, Aubrey, that is the most straightforward.</p>
<p>Now, let's move up in difficulty level maybe.</p>
<p>And what would be the next one?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So this next one, it means that you have demonstrated my point that I just made.</p>
<p>So I made some kind of point, I said something.</p>
<p>And so it has a very similar meaning to saying, see what I mean, or you're right, right?</p>
<p>You're confirming the point someone has made.</p>
<p>Yeah, And this is the one we use at the very top of the show, right?</p>
<p>Yes, Yes, You said that the strategy was actually working, and I had recommended that strategy.</p>
<p>And so you've proved that it's working.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Right, And it is very encouraging too, right?</p>
<p>So for example, let's say that you say you think a store opens at nine, and then a friend confirms it opens at nine.</p>
<p>And then so you could respond, there you go.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So you're sort of like, you have stated something, someone else confirms it.</p>
<p>And this is a very friendly way to say, yeah, see.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>Yeah, You know, say, yeah, see?</p>
<p>Yeah, You're right.</p>
<p>Or I was right.</p>
<p>See what I mean?</p>
<p>Yeah, I'd say it's pretty friendly.</p>
<p>Right, It's upbeat.</p>
<p>It's not rude or kind of.</p>
<p>Yeah, It's not in any way.</p>
<p>It's just being polite and kind.</p>
<p>Right, Most of the time.</p>
<p>Another example.</p>
<p>You say no one is hiring.</p>
<p>You say that no one is hiring for a job.</p>
<p>And a friend says they've applied a ton of places and haven't heard back.</p>
<p>And then you say, see, there you go.</p>
<p>Right, Meaning, see, I'm right.</p>
<p>No one is actually hiring.</p>
<p>Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>You will hear this all the time.</p>
<p>We use this all the time because the other ways you could say this, right?</p>
<p>To say like, see, I'm right.</p>
<p>Or see, you proved my point.</p>
<p>Or whatever you could say.</p>
<p>Almost sounds more like know-it-all-ish, whereas this is very friendly and sort of collaborative.</p>
<p>Yeah, Exactly.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Or just the really obnoxious that kids say sometimes.</p>
<p>See?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>That's super obnoxious and annoying.</p>
<p>And you just don't want to say that as an adult.</p>
<p>Right, Or told you so.</p>
<p>Told you so.</p>
<p>Told you so.</p>
<p>Don't say those things as an adult now.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>as an adult now, right?</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>So this kind of is the adult equivalent of that, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, In a way, but it's more polite.</p>
<p>It's more pleasant.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>All right, let's dive into number three, which is very similar, but it's often just said to encourage.</p>
<p>So it means more like you did it or you've done well.</p>
<p>Good, yes, I love that.</p>
<p>So for example, after teaching a child to serve a volleyball, right?</p>
<p>You teach them to serve in the game and they succeed many times and you wanna say something to encourage that kid.</p>
<p>Say, there you go, right?</p>
<p>What intonation would you use there, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that works or there you go, because yeah, it's often, it's like, if someone has tried and tried, there have been multiple attempts.</p>
<p>This was also said to me recently at Pickleball, cause I was trying like a new serve and when I finally got it, I remember my partner being like, there you go.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So it's more sort of acknowledging the effort that has been made, the failed attempts.</p>
<p>Yes, Like, okay, you finally got it.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>and say like, okay, you finally got it.</p>
<p>You did it, but very encouraging.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that's it.</p>
<p>I think that's the intonation.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Right, There you go.</p>
<p>It's, it's harder on the backend.</p>
<p>It's punched on the backend.</p>
<p>Love that.</p>
<p>Any other example?</p>
<p>Yeah, So I've, I've done this before when someone can't think of a name and then they finally remember it.</p>
<p>Right, And be like, there you go.</p>
<p>And this, we're punching a little more of the front end because it's sort of like, especially if together, you're not remembering if you're both like, what was their name?</p>
<p>And you're both trying to remember.</p>
<p>And someone says, Janet, there you go.</p>
<p>Right, So it's sort of the, it's almost kind of a combination of number two and number three, right.</p>
<p>Where you're confirming that someone figured it out, but also like giving that little bit of praise, like, Oh, you're the one that figured it out.</p>
<p>Good job.</p>
<p>Yes, I love that.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>These are all very distinct ways we use this phrase, right?</p>
<p>Yes,</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>Okay, Aubrey, let's get into a role play and see where these show up in our conversation.</p>
<p>So here we are discussing upcoming movies.</p>
<p>I guess that means movies that are going to be released soon.</p>
<p>Yeah, Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, You want to start us out?</p>
<p>Yes, I think some good movies will be in the theater soon.</p>
<p>Yeah, Wicked opens next week.</p>
<p>Well, there you go.</p>
<p>Hey, I was at Costco and got you some of those chocolates you like.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Oh, there you go.</p>
<p>Being so thoughtful again.</p>
<p>So we used all three.</p>
<p>It's good to happen that they all come up in a conversation because like you mentioned, Lindsay, they all sort of have different intonation.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>They all sort of have different intonation.</p>
<p>And because they all mean something a little different, a native English speaker might not even realize that they're using the same words.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>They feel very different.</p>
<p>And so the first one, I said, I think there will be some good movies, and then you gave me an example to prove my point, right, which is that lines up with our example at the top of the show too.</p>
<p>And I said, well, there you go.</p>
<p>Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>Right, That's the second way that we use it.</p>
<p>You're confirming.</p>
<p>You've proven a point.</p>
<p>Yeah, There you go.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Then what else, Aubrey?</p>
<p>And then I said, oh, I got you some of those chocolates you like, and here I'm just handing you something.</p>
<p>Right, So I hand you this bag of chocolates.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Yes, Good.</p>
<p>And then now, so this is number three.</p>
<p>The example is number three, and you've given me these chocolates and I want to say, wow, thank you so much.</p>
<p>It's a way of saying thank you.</p>
<p>Right, And I, what would you say, Aubrey?</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Yeah, And that was perfect.</p>
<p>Like, ah, there you go being so thoughtful again.</p>
<p>Yeah, So yeah, this is interesting.</p>
<p>Right, Yeah, It's sort of encouraging someone.</p>
<p>Yeah, </p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>is it's sort of encouraging someone for being such a good friend, being thoughtful, that we use this, there you go.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is really interesting.</p>
<p>I'm basically saying, oh, wow, you're being so thoughtful, exactly.</p>
<p>I wanna acknowledge that you're being thoughtful in this moment.</p>
<p>Exactly, yes.</p>
<p>And so sometimes we'll say it sort of at the top of a phrase like this.</p>
<p>And in that case, the intonation, we hit you harder, right?</p>
<p>There, or it's still there.</p>
<p>We're still saying there louder.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>We kind of slow it down.</p>
<p>We sort of emphasize each word, there you go, being so thoughtful again.</p>
<p>Exactly, and for our listeners, guys, if you listen really closely, the intonation is very different from the first one where you said, yeah, Wicked opens next week.</p>
<p>Well, there you go, right?</p>
<p>Very different.</p>
<p>I would never use the same intonation with this last example.</p>
<p>This is really tricky where for all three of these, the intonation, a lot of the meaning of like which there you go you're using is intonation of the words.</p>
<p>Wow, that's really a really important point.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>that's a really important point, right?</p>
<p>You can't just say the phrase.</p>
<p>To convey the meaning, we need to say it completely differently.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would listen to this episode twice.</p>
<p>Like now that you have the meanings of all three ways that we use it, go back, listen to the intonation, note the difference, which words are being emphasized, how do we slow down a little bit because there's a lot of meaning in that intonation.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Okay, so where else can our listeners go as we're finishing up today if they want more All Ears English?</p>
<p>Yeah, we want to make sure you didn't miss episode 2315.</p>
<p>Just scroll up a recent episode that was Who Asked You?</p>

<p>Now, Aubrey, I feel like we've stumbled on something important, which is intonation.</p>
<p>It really matters, especially with</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>matters, especially with a phrase that has three different uses.</p>
<p>Opposite, totally different uses.</p>
<p>So, what's our takeaway today?</p>
<p>What else should we know?</p>
<p>You know, there you go.</p>
<p>Like you said, it has three different meanings, and depending on the intonation and the context, it could actually be quite confusing if you use the wrong intonation.</p>
<p>So, definitely, I'm glad you guys are following here.</p>
<p>Use today's tips because we want you to be able to use these and understand them when others use them, but intonation is everything.</p>
<p>I also think this phrase could be really useful for our listeners who feel like the conversation just dead ends for you, right?</p>
<p>I know that we've seen that in surveys when we've talked to our listeners.</p>
<p>Sometimes they feel like they don't know what else to say.</p>
<p>Like I could see an example, you know, I think good movies are coming out.</p>
<p>Yeah, Wicked opens next week, and then silence.</p>
<p>What are you going to say, right?</p>
<p>Yes, it does.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What else?</p>
<p>We need to say something else, and this could be an add-on to keep that conversation going, right?</p>
<p>Good point.</p>
<p>It's such a great connection.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>Good point.</p>
<p>It's such a great connection skill to encourage this way, to confirm.</p>
<p>And this is a great way to do it, to say, there you go.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's it.</p>
<p>So, guys, leave this, put this in your repertoire, and we will be back very soon.</p>
<p>We'll see you next time.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>See you next time.</p>
