<p id="p-12">Hello, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-13">How are you?</p>
<p id="p-14">How's it going?</p>
<p id="p-15">Hi, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-16">I'm good.</p>
<p id="p-17">I'm good.</p>
<p id="p-18">But I have a question.</p>
<p id="p-19">All right.</p>
<p id="p-20">I'm ready.</p>
<p id="p-21">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-22">Have you ever been worried about having to change some sort of plan based on the weather and then the bad weather never came?</p>
<p id="p-23">Yeah, of course, especially in the summer.</p>
<p id="p-24">I like to plan things outdoors.</p>
<p id="p-25">I like to go to picnics, post picnics, outdoor parties, and especially if I host at home, I want to have people outside on my porch, not inside the house, right?</p>
<p id="p-26">So what about you?</p>
<p id="p-27">Do you worry about these things?</p>
<p id="p-28">Yeah, I mean, actually just because Dan was supposed to leave on a trip to Florida in two days, but then they started talking</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-29">but then they started talking about a lot of snow that could come.</p>
<p id="p-30">So he was kind of scrambling.</p>
<p id="p-31">That's a good key word for today.</p>
<p id="p-32">That's a great keyword.</p>
<p id="p-33">Yeah, he was scrambling and trying to figure out, well, I don't know if this actually is gonna turn into something or not, but he ended up changing his flight to earlier.</p>
<p id="p-34">But I mean, it's possible it will just be like a big nothing burger, you know?</p>
<p id="p-35">I feel like that happens a lot with weather.</p>
<p id="p-36">It really does.</p>
<p id="p-37">A big nothing burger.</p>
<p id="p-38">Michelle, are you talking about going to get hamburgers?</p>
<p id="p-39">Are we getting burgers or what's happening here?</p>
<p id="p-40">No, we're not getting burgers right now, but this is a really fun, really silly expression that's pretty trendy nowadays.</p>
<p id="p-41">Don't you think?</p>
<p id="p-42">Yeah, I really like this one.</p>
<p id="p-43">I think it's fun.</p>
<p id="p-44">I've heard it on TV.</p>
<p id="p-45">It's ridiculous, but that's why we like it.</p>
<p id="p-46">Maybe it's silly and it's fun.</p>
<p id="p-47">Right, and this is, I mean, basically what it is, it's used</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-48">I mean, basically what it is, it's used to describe situations that have a lot of hype, but they never pan out.</p>
<p id="p-49">So it never actually happens.</p>
<p id="p-50">So we're going to talk about this more in just a minute.</p>
<p id="p-51">But firstly, we want to say thank you so much to our reviewers.</p>
<p id="p-52">Yes, we have one special reviewer that I'd like to call out today, an amazing five-star review from Donnie Mir, who said this has become my daily companion.</p>
<p id="p-53">It's a good approach for adult learning.</p>
<p id="p-54">Donnie Mir is from Indonesia and they left a review in Apple Podcasts.</p>
<p id="p-55">So thank you so much, Donnie Mir, for your review.</p>
<p id="p-56">And Michelle, what do we want to ask our listeners to do?</p>
<p id="p-57">Yeah, guys, thank you so much to Donnie Mir.</p>
<p id="p-58">And we would love to hear from you.</p>
<p id="p-59">Go wherever you are listening to the All Ears English podcast and write us a review.</p>
<p id="p-60">We'd love to hear from you.</p>
<p id="p-61">You can even ask a question in there, but we do read all of your reviews and it means a lot to us.</p>
<p id="p-62">So thank you so much.</p>
<p id="p-63">You got it.</p>
<p id="p-64">All right, good stuff.</p>
<p id="p-65">So let's</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-66">You got it.</p>
<p id="p-67">All right, good stuff.</p>
<p id="p-68">So let's get into nothing burger.</p>
<p id="p-69">It does sound funny.</p>
<p id="p-70">It sounds funny.</p>
<p id="p-71">I don't know where this came from or when it started, but I don't think this, I think this is a pretty recent expression.</p>
<p id="p-72">I don't think in later, I mean, like definitely in the last 10 years, I don't think five or 10, five years maybe.</p>
<p id="p-73">I don't remember hearing this when I was in college or in my 20s.</p>
<p id="p-74">I think it's in the last five years.</p>
<p id="p-75">I think so too.</p>
<p id="p-76">So yeah, a nothing burger, like we were saying, is used to describe a situation where there's tons of attention paid to something and a lot of hype, but then whatever was predicted or expected never happened or maybe it did happen, but it wasn't a big deal.</p>
<p id="p-77">So this, I mean, as I was saying, this makes me think of snowstorms.</p>
<p id="p-78">We've had a couple nothing burgers this year.</p>
<p id="p-79">Actually, I planned this episodes after two separate big storms that were</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-80">separate big storms that were set to occur, and then the schools close and everyone gets nervous and starts closing things, at least in this area.</p>
<p id="p-81">And then it's really nothing.</p>
<p id="p-82">And everyone goes and buys a can of soup for a year, right?</p>
<p id="p-83">That's so funny.</p>
<p id="p-84">Toilet paper, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-85">So then it turns out to be a nothing burger, which means, Lindsey, so in those situations, did it snow?</p>
<p id="p-86">So it means that it didn't end up, maybe it snowed, but it was probably not nearly as much of a big deal as you predicted, right?</p>
<p id="p-87">Maybe it was just a dusting.</p>
<p id="p-88">And the problem with the East Coast, right, is that you can have nothing burgers, but then you do have big, actual huge storms sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-89">It's impossible to know.</p>
<p id="p-90">Of course, we can all pay attention to the weather, but things are changing all the time.</p>
<p id="p-91">The reports can be wrong, and so you don't know, is it going to be a nothing burger or not?</p>
<p id="p-92">Yeah, it's true.</p>
<p id="p-93">This time, I guess it was, two times for you, it was.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-94">for you.</p>
<p id="p-95">It was at a couple nothing.</p>
<p id="p-96">But it's kind of a letdown too, especially if you're a kid and school gets, well I guess if school gets canceled, you're feeling great no matter what happens.</p>
<p id="p-97">But you know, when you expect a snowstorm, you kind of get into the mentality of getting cozy in the house and staying in.</p>
<p id="p-98">And then when it doesn't happen, you think, oh, I should be going out.</p>
<p id="p-99">I should do something.</p>
<p id="p-100">Right, It ends up being this whole mental trip.</p>
<p id="p-101">True, true.</p>
<p id="p-102">So let's do a few more examples of this.</p>
<p id="p-103">Let's do the first one.</p>
<p id="p-104">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-105">I'm tired of all the worry about snow.</p>
<p id="p-106">These storms have all turned out to be nothing burgers.</p>
<p id="p-107">Or here, it's not always about the weather.</p>
<p id="p-108">You could say, I was so worried about the pop quiz, but it was a nothing burger.</p>
<p id="p-109">Super easy.</p>
<p id="p-110">Just one question.</p>
<p id="p-111">Oh, one question.</p>
<p id="p-112">Geez.</p>
<p id="p-113">And here's another one.</p>
<p id="p-114">The politician warned of budget cuts to come, but it turned out it was a nothing burger.</p>
<p id="p-115">Yeah, And this can apply to politics for sure, right?</p>
<p id="p-116">When someone is saying they're going to do</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-117">right when someone is saying they're going to do something and it seems like it's going to change everything and then it's just empty threads, for example.</p>
<p id="p-118">So anytime we have an anticipation that something is going to be a huge deal and it just isn't, right?</p>
<p id="p-119">That's when it's a nothing burger.</p>
<p id="p-120">Yeah, And I do hear this on the news a lot too.</p>
<p id="p-121">Yeah, Okay.</p>
<p id="p-122">We do have one more example though, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-123">Should I read that?</p>
<p id="p-124">All right, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-125">I was so nervous when my boyfriend told me we needed to talk, but it was a nothing burger.</p>
<p id="p-126">He just wanted to confirm plans for Friday.</p>
<p id="p-127">Oh, that's scary.</p>
<p id="p-128">Right, When you have this anticipation and then, oh, okay.</p>
<p id="p-129">All right.</p>
<p id="p-130">That's it.</p>
<p id="p-131">It reminds me of the dating days, right?</p>
<p id="p-132">If someone's going to break up with you, they might say, oh, we need to talk, right?</p>
<p id="p-133">Very awkward, but then maybe it's a nothing burger, hopefully.</p>
<p id="p-134">Yeah, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-135">I mean, Lindsay, can you think of any examples from your life where something was a nothing burger?</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-136">from your life where something was a nothing burger, maybe a time where you thought something was going to get rained out or anything?</p>
<p id="p-137">Yeah, maybe, for example, I was in New York this past weekend and in New York, they always change the train routes on the weekends.</p>
<p id="p-138">They take the R train and put it express going into Queens.</p>
<p id="p-139">They do crazy things, right?</p>
<p id="p-140">And so I was a little bit nervous about that.</p>
<p id="p-141">Like, are the trains going to be totally messed up?</p>
<p id="p-142">But it turned out to be a nothing burger.</p>
<p id="p-143">The trains were pretty much on schedule, so we were good to go.</p>
<p id="p-144">Yeah, So your worries were a nothing burger, basically, right?</p>
<p id="p-145">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-146">My worries were a nothing burger.</p>
<p id="p-147">Yeah, So let's talk about some other ways to say this now.</p>
<p id="p-148">One of these actually we'll get to in a minute, but Lindsay, you actually used one of these already.</p>
<p id="p-149">But let's do the first one.</p>
<p id="p-150">So the first one is much ado about nothing.</p>
<p id="p-151">And I believe it comes from Shakespeare.</p>
<p id="p-152">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-153">I think it does.</p>
<p id="p-154">Yes, so it's basically</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-155">Yes, so it's basically like a lot of fuss and nothing happens.</p>
<p id="p-156">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-157">So for example, my team got so stressed about the training, but it was much ado about nothing.</p>
<p id="p-158">It was just easy and took five minutes.</p>
<p id="p-159">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-160">I'd say this one is a little less common, but it's nice to kind of dress up your language and have fun with it sometimes by quoting Shakespeare, right?</p>
<p id="p-161">Definitely.</p>
<p id="p-162">And then this is the one you used was empty threat, or you can also say empty promise.</p>
<p id="p-163">So that's a little bit different, but I wanted to say it anyway.</p>
<p id="p-164">So what is an empty threat or an empty promise?</p>
<p id="p-165">When someone is just saying they're going to do something or promising to do something, but they have no intention of doing it, or eventually it just ends up not happening, right?</p>
<p id="p-166">It's empty.</p>
<p id="p-167">There's no energy, no substance behind it.</p>
<p id="p-168">Right, So I guess as a parent, Michelle, you probably do this a little, but we won't tell your kids, but.</p>
<p id="p-169">Sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-170">Sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-171">Well, it's just hard because I'm a softie.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-172">I'm a softie.</p>
<p id="p-173">Lindsay, what does that mean?</p>
<p id="p-174">A softie?</p>
<p id="p-175">You're the parent that the kids will come to to get some more leeway, right, compared to the other parent?</p>
<p id="p-176">Yeah, so I'm not very good at saying, oh, I'm going to do this, and then I don't do it.</p>
<p id="p-177">I'm like, oh, okay, we can get another whatever.</p>
<p id="p-178">Oh, sure.</p>
<p id="p-179">But an example could be parents tend to make empty threats and empty promises to get their kids to behave.</p>
<p id="p-180">Yes, right.</p>
<p id="p-181">So they don't necessarily plan on carrying out the threat, right, but they want to scare them and have them do something, whatever it is, clean up their room.</p>
<p id="p-182">I'll turn this car around right now! Oh, my gosh, that is the famous phrase.</p>
<p id="p-183">Essential, yep.</p>
<p id="p-184">Right, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-185">This next one is false alarm.</p>
<p id="p-186">Also really good.</p>
<p id="p-187">So, for example, oh, no, we have to cook the whole thing again.</p>
<p id="p-188">Oh, wait, false alarm.</p>
<p id="p-189">I actually did follow the recipe correctly.</p>
<p id="p-190">Oh, that would be scary.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-191">Oh, that would be scary.</p>
<p id="p-192">Actually, I have a story.</p>
<p id="p-193">You do?</p>
<p id="p-194">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-195">But it wasn't a false alarm.</p>
<p id="p-196">We were just making a soup.</p>
<p id="p-197">I've gotten really into soup making because I guess that's what happens as you get older.</p>
<p id="p-198">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-199">I guess so.</p>
<p id="p-200">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-201">Or at least to me.</p>
<p id="p-202">But so we were making a soup and we were just at the salting part.</p>
<p id="p-203">We were just going to put salt on it and it was almost done and it had all these fresh veggies in it.</p>
<p id="p-204">And then we let my son be in charge of the salting.</p>
<p id="p-205">And then I don't think it was his fault, but the top got unscrewed and all the salt fell into it.</p>
<p id="p-206">Oh, no.</p>
<p id="p-207">Oh, that must have been intense.</p>
<p id="p-208">So did you just throw it out or what did you do?</p>
<p id="p-209">Well, Dan kept on trying to rescue the soup, but in the end he didn't feel well because he kept on trying to take sips of it and water it down.</p>
<p id="p-210">Oh, no.</p>
<p id="p-211">Oh, gosh.</p>
<p id="p-212">What a disaster.</p>
<p id="p-213">Yeah, he was just having way too much salt.</p>
<p id="p-214">Yeah, the soup was not saved.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-215">salt.</p>
<p id="p-216">Yeah, the soup was not saved.</p>
<p id="p-217">We ended up just making a hodgepodge of random stuff.</p>
<p id="p-218">Well, it happens sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-219">It happens.</p>
<p id="p-220">That's okay.</p>
<p id="p-221">All right.</p>
<p id="p-222">So let's do a role play.</p>
<p id="p-223">So here we are friends and we are getting ready for our other friend's wedding.</p>
<p id="p-224">All right, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-225">I got so scared when Jasmine told me she needed to talk about the dresses.</p>
<p id="p-226">Luckily, it was much ado about nothing.</p>
<p id="p-227">She just changed the color.</p>
<p id="p-228">No biggie.</p>
<p id="p-229">Oh, that's good.</p>
<p id="p-230">I'm glad it was a nothing burger.</p>
<p id="p-231">You've been working so hard.</p>
<p id="p-232">Thanks.</p>
<p id="p-233">I also thought she was going to tell me I had to change my flight, but it was a false alarm.</p>
<p id="p-234">Oh, good, good.</p>
<p id="p-235">Seems like she gets all excited about things and they turn out to be nothing burgers.</p>
<p id="p-236">Yeah, but sometimes she makes empty promises.</p>
<p id="p-237">I could use some help with this planning.</p>
<p id="p-238">I can help.</p>
<p id="p-239">Oh, man.</p>
<p id="p-240">So it sounds like maybe you're the maid of honor, right?</p>
<p id="p-241">And you're doing the planning, but it's hard to work with the bride.</p>
<p id="p-242">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-243">Yes, it could be a little bit difficult.</p>
<p id="p-244">So, all right.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-245">All right, let's do this.</p>
<p id="p-246">So I said, I got scared when she needed to talk about the dresses.</p>
<p id="p-247">Luckily, it was much ado about nothing.</p>
<p id="p-248">Yes, So again, that's that the historical quote that if you want to sound fancy, you can do that.</p>
<p id="p-249">You can add that in there instead of nothing burger, but it really means the same thing.</p>
<p id="p-250">It means there was a lot of energy around this issue, but nothing happened.</p>
<p id="p-251">Right?</p>
<p id="p-252">Right, Yep.</p>
<p id="p-253">And then you said, that's good.</p>
<p id="p-254">I'm glad it was a nothing burger, right?</p>
<p id="p-255">So it was not all that I had thought it would be.</p>
<p id="p-256">It was not that scary.</p>
<p id="p-257">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-258">And then you said, I also thought she was going to tell me I had to change my flight, but it was a false alarm.</p>
<p id="p-259">So another example of another way to say it, something didn't pan out.</p>
<p id="p-260">It didn't end up happening.</p>
<p id="p-261">Right?</p>
<p id="p-262">And then you said, seems like she gets all excited about things and they turn out to be nothing burgers.</p>
<p id="p-263">So now</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-264">burgers.</p>
<p id="p-265">So now you're not going to use nothing burgers all the time, right?</p>
<p id="p-266">You just said it.</p>
<p id="p-267">Actually, this was a mistake on my part by writing it twice.</p>
<p id="p-268">So that's okay.</p>
<p id="p-269">Well, we've seen two ways that it gets used.</p>
<p id="p-270">It's okay.</p>
<p id="p-271">It's okay.</p>
<p id="p-272">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-273">Yeah, And then you said, yeah, but sometimes she makes empty promises.</p>
<p id="p-274">I could use some help with the planning.</p>
<p id="p-275">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-276">That feels a little more serious when you say that, doesn't it?</p>
<p id="p-277">Yeah, Now we're.</p>
<p id="p-278">Yeah, Yeah, Because it's like the person sometimes, I mean, people usually know when they're making an empty promise, right?</p>
<p id="p-279">Because they don't have any intention to fulfill that promise.</p>
<p id="p-280">So that's a bit more of like a negative on that person.</p>
<p id="p-281">Nothing burger can just be like a scenario that just didn't happen the way you thought it would.</p>
<p id="p-282">Right, Empty promise or empty threat.</p>
<p id="p-283">That shows a little bit more intent, a little bit more planning.</p>
<p id="p-284">Yes, Not in a good way.</p>
<p id="p-285">Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-286">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-287">All right.</p>
<p id="p-288">Good stuff.</p>
<p id="p-289">These are super useful phrases, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-290">What's another?</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-291">What phrases, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-292">What's another episode our listeners can go to?</p>
<p id="p-293">Okay, this is another fun one we did.</p>
<p id="p-294">It was All Ears English, and the episode was, This episode is textbook All Ears English.</p>
<p id="p-295">That was really fun.</p>
<p id="p-296">Yeah, that's really fun, and I love that title.</p>
<p id="p-297">So what does this mean for connection for our listeners here, Nothingburger?</p>
<p id="p-298">People can really identify with this, I think, because there's a lot of anxiety in the world right now, and there's a lot of trying to plan for the worst situation and really just figuring out what to do.</p>
<p id="p-299">And so this Nothingburger expression kind of pulls that release valve of, oh, it was a Nothingburger.</p>
