<p id="p-15">You know, it turns out, Michelle, I need to have an early lunch today.</p>
<p id="p-16">So I guess we won't be recording extra episodes today.</p>
<p id="p-17">Maybe next time.</p>
<p id="p-18">Okay, okay.</p>
<p id="p-19">Okay, Lindsay, today we have a listener question about the expression after all that I'm really excited to get to.</p>
<p id="p-20">Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-21">And this question comes from our listener, Sophia, who did have a question last week that we answered as well.</p>

<p id="p-39">Yes, that would be great, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-40">Thank you.</p>
<p id="p-41">I'll do it.</p>
<p id="p-42">All right, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-43">This is from YouTube from Sophia.</p>
<p id="p-44">Hey, I'm Sophia and I have a question about the phrase after all.</p>
<p id="p-45">How is it used and how does it change the tone of a sentence?</p>
<p id="p-46">For example, so are you going to visit me after all?</p>
<p id="p-47">My friend sent me this and she's just asking if I'm going to visit her, but it seems a bit intense.</p>
<p id="p-48">Looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p id="p-49">Thank you so much for creating such great learning content.</p>
<p id="p-50">Well, thank you, Sophia, for another great question.</p>
<p id="p-51">You are awesome.</p>
<p id="p-52">Yeah, we love those questions.</p>
<p id="p-53">Keep them coming.</p>
<p id="p-54">So this is a</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-55">them coming.</p>
<p id="p-56">So this is a great, it's almost like Sophia is really observing native natural English, right?</p>
<p id="p-57">After all is a truly natural thing to say.</p>
<p id="p-58">And there's a lot here.</p>
<p id="p-59">We need to give some context, right?</p>
<p id="p-60">Yes, there is.</p>
<p id="p-61">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-62">You're so right.</p>
<p id="p-63">And we're going to talk about that.</p>
<p id="p-64">So let's dive into after all.</p>
<p id="p-65">So the message Sophia received.</p>
<p id="p-66">So are you going to visit me after all?</p>
<p id="p-67">Yeah, So Lindsay, what does it mean to you here?</p>
<p id="p-68">So it's very, very different from just saying, are you going to visit me?</p>
<p id="p-69">Right?</p>
<p id="p-70">What's different here is when we say, are you going to visit me after all?</p>
<p id="p-71">It means that there was some kind of large discussion over whether or not she was going to be coming to visit.</p>
<p id="p-72">There's a lot that's already happened.</p>
<p id="p-73">There's a lot of context that we don't have, but it means they've had, maybe she was wavering back and forth.</p>
<p id="p-74">Oh, I can't come.</p>
<p id="p-75">I can come.</p>
<p id="p-76">I can't come.</p>
<p id="p-77">I can come.</p>
<p id="p-78">And then finally, this friend</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-79">And finally, this friend is saying, so are you going to visit me?</p>
<p id="p-80">Or maybe there was some kind of plan to come and she had to cancel.</p>
<p id="p-81">And then she tried to come again.</p>
<p id="p-82">She had to cancel.</p>
<p id="p-83">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-84">There's a lot of things.</p>
<p id="p-85">Right, There's layers.</p>
<p id="p-86">There's layers to this.</p>
<p id="p-87">It's basically saying that there's a surprise or twist that you're going to visit her if you do.</p>
<p id="p-88">And like Lindsay said, there's a background to this.</p>
<p id="p-89">There's more to the story.</p>
<p id="p-90">There's context.</p>
<p id="p-91">So yeah, maybe the hesitating and maybe you canceled or maybe you had rejected her invitation many years.</p>
<p id="p-92">And so it's kind of saying, oh, after all that, you're going to come visit me.</p>
<p id="p-93">So yeah, it's loaded.</p>
<p id="p-94">It's totally loaded.</p>
<p id="p-95">Very loaded.</p>
<p id="p-96">I mean, would you say this is intense?</p>
<p id="p-97">Kind of intense.</p>
<p id="p-98">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-99">Maybe they have a very intense friendship or something.</p>
<p id="p-100">It's kind of emotional maybe.</p>
<p id="p-101">There's a lot here.</p>
<p id="p-102">It's so different from, hey, are you going to come visit?</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-103">Hey, are you going to come visit?</p>
<p id="p-104">Totally different.</p>
<p id="p-105">Right, Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-106">And we don't, the truth is, Sophia, we don't really have enough information to truly answer this.</p>
<p id="p-107">We would need more context, right?</p>
<p id="p-108">It could be intense if it was meant more like that second way where we're talking about, oh, you know, after all this time, I've been waiting and I'm kind of annoyed that you haven't visited me.</p>
<p id="p-109">So it really, really kind of depends on the context.</p>
<p id="p-110">But let's give some more examples of how this would be used.</p>
<p id="p-111">And we're going to do some role plays throughout this episode.</p>
<p id="p-112">So get ready.</p>
<p id="p-113">All right.</p>
<p id="p-114">Perfect.</p>
<p id="p-115">So let's start with that first role play, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-116">And here we are roommates.</p>
<p id="p-117">And I said that I was moving out next year.</p>
<p id="p-118">And then what happened, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-119">A little context.</p>
<p id="p-120">So you said you were going to move out and then you sent me a message saying that you might reconsider.</p>
<p id="p-121">So yeah, there's like a back and forth.</p>
<p id="p-122">Oh, she's moving out now.</p>
<p id="p-123">Are you changing your mind?</p>
<p id="p-124">So you come home after you sent that text.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-125">come home after you sent that text message and I am in the kitchen.</p>
<p id="p-126">Okay, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-127">You're in the kitchen.</p>
<p id="p-128">All right.</p>
<p id="p-129">All right.</p>
<p id="p-130">Hey, Michelle, did you get my text?</p>
<p id="p-131">Oh yeah.</p>
<p id="p-132">So you're going to re-sign after all?</p>
<p id="p-133">It's not 100%, but I'm hoping to.</p>
<p id="p-134">Great.</p>
<p id="p-135">Oh boy.</p>
<p id="p-136">Yeah, So there was some confusion that's happened, some back and forth, some indecision, right?</p>
<p id="p-137">A sense of people being indecisive maybe?</p>
<p id="p-138">Yeah, so exactly.</p>
<p id="p-139">I meant, you know, it basically was saying in the end, like, that's your decision.</p>
<p id="p-140">Something changed.</p>
<p id="p-141">There was a twist.</p>
<p id="p-142">And essentially what you're saying when you say after all, you're saying after all of that drama or after all of that confusion or that indecision.</p>
<p id="p-143">Yeah, Right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-144">So let's do, this is a similar context.</p>
<p id="p-145">So here we got in a big fight about you moving out.</p>
<p id="p-146">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-147">Then you sent</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-148">Okay, then you sent the text, you know, saying that you were thinking that you might reconsider.</p>
<p id="p-149">Okay, so here you go.</p>
<p id="p-150">Here you go.</p>
<p id="p-151">You come home.</p>
<p id="p-152">All right.</p>
<p id="p-153">Hey, Michelle, did you get my text?</p>
<p id="p-154">Hi.</p>
<p id="p-155">Yeah, so you're staying after all?</p>
<p id="p-156">I think so.</p>
<p id="p-157">I'm sorry about before.</p>
<p id="p-158">Thanks.</p>
<p id="p-159">That doesn't seem like that's going to be a very good living situation.</p>
<p id="p-160">Ooh, that's awkward.</p>
<p id="p-161">I'm going to reconsider again, right?</p>
<p id="p-162">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-163">Then you're going to say, oh, you're leaving after all.</p>
<p id="p-164">Yeah, The point is, there's just a lot that has to have happened before if you're going to add after all.</p>
<p id="p-165">It's not just a neutral question.</p>
<p id="p-166">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-167">Right, Yep.</p>
<p id="p-168">It's loaded, as Lindsay said.</p>
<p id="p-169">Yes, アメリカン航空とJALで旅はもっと豊かに。プレミアムキャビンで出会う2つの国の文化とおもてなし。上質な空の時間があなたの旅をさらに特別にします。</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-170">旅をさらに特別にします。そしてアドバンテージやJMBでマイルを貯めて、旅の楽しみをもっと自由に。つながる、つながさ、広がる体験。アメリカン航空とJALで心に残る次の旅へ。OK、ミシェル、戻ってきました。一般的に何かが変わったことを示しています。ストーリーのツイストがありました。例えば、私は彼が私を嫌いだと思ったのですが、彼は結局2回目のデートを申し込みました。ここで、結局は私がこの人を嫌いだと心配することを意味します。そうです。例えば、彼のテキストが通じなかったり。そうです。そうです。結局、結局、このように使える方法がたくさんあります。そして、もう一つの方法を教えますが、戻ってきます。ですから、結局は、理由や説明を与える方法としても使用できます。</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-171">an explanation.</p>
<p id="p-172">So for example, I don't want to bother you.</p>
<p id="p-173">After all, I know you're still busy working on that project.</p>
<p id="p-174">Yeah, this is a slightly more advanced way to use it, but I'm excited that we're going into this today.</p>
<p id="p-175">Here's another example.</p>
<p id="p-176">He slept until 3 p.m. After all, he's completely jet lagged still.</p>
<p id="p-177">Or I want to save money.</p>
<p id="p-178">I'm hoping to buy a new house after all.</p>
<p id="p-179">Yeah, Now, how do we explain this part, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-180">This use of after all.</p>
<p id="p-181">Well, yeah, it's giving an extra, it's giving more information, right?</p>
<p id="p-182">It's giving the excuse or the reason or the explanation.</p>
<p id="p-183">So I want to save money.</p>
<p id="p-184">So I could have just, it sounds, if I could have said, I want to save money.</p>
<p id="p-185">I'm hoping to buy a new house.</p>
<p id="p-186">Right, And then I could have cut it off here, but this gives it, rounds it out nicely.</p>
<p id="p-187">Rounds it out, gives it a little bit more context, maybe adds a little emotion to it, a little urgency.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-188">into it a little urgency, showing that this thing is maybe important to you.</p>
<p id="p-189">I don't want to bother you.</p>
<p id="p-190">After all, I know you're still busy working on that project.</p>
<p id="p-191">So again, you could have said, I don't want to bother you.</p>
<p id="p-192">I know you're still working on that project.</p>
<p id="p-193">Totally legitimate to say that.</p>
<p id="p-194">But we add the after all, why, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-195">It just kind of rounds it out.</p>
<p id="p-196">And it shows this extra level of understanding or this explanation, right?</p>
<p id="p-197">It just shows that there's, I don't know, there's a little more oomph to it.</p>
<p id="p-198">You know what?</p>
<p id="p-199">That's a great word.</p>
<p id="p-200">Oomph.</p>
<p id="p-201">Yeah, You guys get the transcripts to make sure you can see that word written in the transcripts.</p>
<p id="p-202">All right.</p>
<p id="p-203">What else do we need to know here, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-204">Okay, great.</p>
<p id="p-205">So I was adding oomph.</p>
<p id="p-206">Okay, so I mean, which way would you say is more common?</p>
<p id="p-207">I mean, that first way or, you know, the first way?</p>
<p id="p-208">Yeah, you think the first one?</p>
<p id="p-209">First way.</p>
<p id="p-210">Yeah, I think the first way.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-211">way.</p>
<p id="p-212">Yeah, I think the first way, but it is very, very natural to use the second way.</p>
<p id="p-213">It is rounding it out.</p>
<p id="p-214">It's adding a little more context, maybe some emotional context.</p>
<p id="p-215">So I like both.</p>
<p id="p-216">Yeah, I mean, I'm just glad that we we could go over two very different ways of using these.</p>
<p id="p-217">So should we put it together in a role play?</p>
<p id="p-218">Yeah, let's put this together.</p>
<p id="p-219">So again, we need context.</p>
<p id="p-220">What's happening?</p>
<p id="p-221">We are friends in this situation, but you told me that you can't meet tonight for dinner because you're sick.</p>
<p id="p-222">So I'm going to go out and I'm going to run into you.</p>
<p id="p-223">Uh-oh.</p>
<p id="p-224">And another friend at a restaurant.</p>
<p id="p-225">I'm going to catch you in a lie.</p>
<p id="p-226">Uh-oh.</p>
<p id="p-227">Okay, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-228">Now that our listeners have the context, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-229">All right.</p>
<p id="p-230">Oh, hi, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-231">How are you feeling?</p>
<p id="p-232">Oh, you know, it's the weirdest thing.</p>
<p id="p-233">I guess I feel better after all.</p>
<p id="p-234">I decided to get some soup and ran into Stacey.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-235">I decided to get some soup and ran into Stacy.</p>
<p id="p-236">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-237">Of course, I guess you should get home though.</p>
<p id="p-238">You're still probably carrying germs after all.</p>
<p id="p-239">Oh, I kind of gave you a little bit of a little insult there, right?</p>
<p id="p-240">Yeah, Yeah, Awkward, awkward scenario.</p>
<p id="p-241">Hopefully this has never happened to our listeners, right?</p>
<p id="p-242">We don't want to get caught in a lie, right?</p>
<p id="p-243">So I said, oh, hi, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-244">How are you feeling?</p>
<p id="p-245">And then I said, it's the weirdest thing.</p>
<p id="p-246">I guess I feel better after all.</p>
<p id="p-247">So after that back and forth.</p>
<p id="p-248">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-249">I guess I feel better after all that.</p>
<p id="p-250">Oh, I can't go out tonight.</p>
<p id="p-251">You had told me you couldn't go.</p>
<p id="p-252">You're not feeling well.</p>
<p id="p-253">There was maybe there was some drama.</p>
<p id="p-254">We don't know exactly all of the after all that there was before, right?</p>
<p id="p-255">It just indicates something came.</p>
<p id="p-256">We don't know what the all is.</p>
<p id="p-257">What the all is.</p>
<p id="p-258">Yeah, And then I said,</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-259">And then I said, interesting.</p>
<p id="p-260">Of course, I guess you should get home though.</p>
<p id="p-261">You're still probably carrying germs after all.</p>
<p id="p-262">And then you look right at the mutual friend or the other friend.</p>
<p id="p-263">Oh gosh, I have to say I got back at you here a little bit, didn't I? Yeah, you're kind of twisting a little knife.</p>
<p id="p-264">You are, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-265">So exactly.</p>
<p id="p-266">So right.</p>
<p id="p-267">And the other friend will maybe think, wait, what?</p>
<p id="p-268">Yeah, what do you mean you're sick?</p>
<p id="p-269">What do you mean you have germs?</p>
<p id="p-270">Right?</p>
<p id="p-271">Yeah, yeah, okay.</p>
<p id="p-272">Awkward situations.</p>
<p id="p-273">So yeah, you can use, this is just very versatile.</p>
<p id="p-274">You really, I don't think that it's something that you just throw out, you know, all the time.</p>
<p id="p-275">Definitely not.</p>
<p id="p-276">But it is very helpful for those very specific times where you could use it.</p>
<p id="p-277">Yeah, yeah, I wouldn't say start saying it all the time, like a filler word.</p>
<p id="p-278">Definitely don't do that, but observe.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-279">Definitely don't do that, but observe now for our listeners, guys, go and observe native speakers using this and then start to fit it in when you're ready, okay?</p>
<p id="p-280">And it's another route to connection.</p>
<p id="p-281">This is what we like to show you on this show.</p>
<p id="p-282">All Ears English 2369 is another episode to check out right now.</p>
<p id="p-283">Transition to the truth with these four English words.</p>
<p id="p-284">I love that title, by the way.</p>
<p id="p-285">Fantastic.</p>
<p id="p-286">Yep, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-287">So takeaway today is don't lie to your friends.</p>
<p id="p-288">Yeah, don't lie to your friends, don't get caught lying to your friends.</p>
<p id="p-289">I mean, not good, right?</p>
<p id="p-290">That's a bad feeling, bad energy in the world.</p>
<p id="p-291">You know, maybe call that friend, invite them out.</p>
<p id="p-292">You're feeling better, okay?</p>
<p id="p-293">Call that friend and go out together, right?</p>
<p id="p-294">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-295">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-296">All right, yeah, definitely give this a try.</p>
<p id="p-297">Let us know how it goes, but don't force it, I would say.</p>
