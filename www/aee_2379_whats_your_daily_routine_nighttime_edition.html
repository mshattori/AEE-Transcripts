<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p>One of the most common topics among native-speaking friends is sleeping routines.</p>
<p>Listen in today to talk about your nighttime routines in English for more connection moments.</p>
<p>Hey there, Michelle.</p>
<p>How's it going today?</p>
<p>Oh, pretty good, Lindsay.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>I'm doing well.</p>
<p>Did you sleep well last night?</p>
<p>Um, I slept okay.</p>
<p>I slept okay.</p>
<p>I find that if everybody in my house is asleep earlier than usual, then everything goes better for me.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>Did you sleep well?</p>
<p>I slept pretty well.</p>
<p>I was under the covers.</p>
<p>It's very cold in Denver right now.</p>
<p>So I like to layer the covers on top of me, and that's nice.</p>
<p>So I was nice and warm in bed, for sure, in bed by 10.</p>
<p>Yes, Oh, in bed by 10.</p>
<p>So was that?</p>
<p>No, more like 1030, I guess.</p>
<p>Yeah, Okay.</p>
<p>So what time do you typically go to sleep?</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>What time do you typically go to sleep?</p>
<p>Is that a typical night?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think 10.</p>
<p>I try to be upstairs and getting ready for bed by 10 and maybe in bed by 1030, something like that.</p>
<p>I'm just trying to get a little bit more sleep these days.</p>
<p>Yes, Yeah, it's so hard.</p>
<p>It's so hard when you just want to have some time to relax.</p>
<p>But do you have a sleep routine?</p>
<p>You were saying, oh, you're upstairs at 10, maybe in bed by 1030.</p>
<p>Yeah, I try to do some meditation, some sitting meditation for about 15 minutes.</p>
<p>And then I brush my teeth, get ready, get into bed, read my book a little bit.</p>
<p>It's a whole thing.</p>
<p>It is a bit of a routine, right?</p>
<p>You kind of need that routine to tell your body to calm down and get ready for sleep.</p>
<p>Yes, Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Are you a nighttime shower or a morning shower?</p>
<p>I kind of do both, actually.</p>
<p>If I work out, I'll shower before bed and then I'll wake up again and shower again in the morning.</p>
<p>So that means dry skin.</p>
<p>Yes,</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>That means dry skin.</p>
<p>Yes, Okay, so today we are going to talk about a very common topic, and this is actually part one of a two-part series.</p>
<p>So this is about bedtime and bedtime routines because I realized that this is just an extremely common connection topic.</p>
<p>It really is.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Maybe it's my age, but I find that I talk about this a lot with my friends.</p>
<p>Oh, what time do you go to sleep?</p>
<p>Everyone's excited.</p>
<p>Well, I just think there's a lot of research coming out on how important sleep is now, right?</p>
<p>And people are consuming this research and reading about it and rethinking their routines.</p>
<p>That's what people are doing.</p>
<p>They're rethinking what they're consuming, how they're sleeping, how they're living.</p>
<p>So I think it makes sense that it's a common topic, Michelle.</p>
<p>Yeah, Would you say sometimes you talk about this with your friends?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Because you also want to get a check on your life.</p>
<p>Am I normal?</p>
<p>You think that's what we're doing on a very philosophical level?</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>like philosophical level as human beings when we're asking other people about their routine?</p>
<p>You want to know if what you're doing is normal, right?</p>
<p>That's funny.</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn't think about that, but I guess that's true.</p>
<p>You're just kind of checking, okay, is this?</p>
<p>Everything I'm doing, is that okay?</p>
<p>Yeah, So, well, that's what we're going to talk about today.</p>
<p>We're going to talk about how to share this information, how to connect over this topic in English, because it is very common.</p>
<p>Yes, So, I'm excited for today's episode.</p>
<p>So, let's talk about some expressions that you would use to either share information or ask about someone's bedtime routine.</p>
<p>So, let's go for it.</p>
<p>So, I think that this was actually inspired by me saying or hearing this expression, that's past my bedtime, or you could also say that's way past my bedtime.</p>
<p>What do you think of this?</p>
<p>Way past my bedtime.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you're</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you're really emphasizing something is happening after you're going to be in bed, so you won't be able to attend whatever it is, right?</p>
<p>Right, So for example, if somebody says to you, oh, could I give you a call at around 10.30 tonight?</p>
<p>You could say, oh, no, that's way past my bedtime.</p>
<p>Let's talk tomorrow.</p>
<p>Yeah, Oh, here's a question, Michelle.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this?</p>
<p>Hot takes.</p>
<p>Is it okay to text people after, let's say, 9 p.m. local time?</p>
<p>Because do you assume that they have their phone silenced?</p>
<p>Is it their responsibility or should you not text until the next day?</p>
<p>Such a good question.</p>
<p>Yes, Something that I think about a lot, actually, because I realized, I mean, this happens a lot.</p>
<p>So typically, this is bad, but I have a very hard time texting people during the day.</p>
<p>I'm just busy.</p>
<p>I have a hard time responding to messages during the day because I'm running around.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>during the day because I'm running around and I try not to be, I mean, yeah, I look at my phone, but I want to give a text message the attention it deserves if I want to really respond to someone.</p>
<p>So a lot of times what happens is I get into bed at night and I would just want to write back to some people, but then I always think, oh, is it too late?</p>
<p>Right, Right, Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Yes, Good question.</p>
<p>So we have no answer though.</p>
<p>So we have no, what do you think?</p>
<p>Sometimes you can see if somebody's notifications are silent.</p>
<p>Right, And then I'm very happy.</p>
<p>I can do it.</p>
<p>Sometimes I'll write to them.</p>
<p>I hope I'm not waking you.</p>
<p>Or sometimes I'll wait till the next day, but then it usually doesn't happen.</p>
<p>Right, That's the problem.</p>
<p>You might forget about it.</p>
<p>I've definitely been known to do that.</p>
<p>I also am the same way.</p>
<p>I don't like to text back.</p>
<p>I'm busy.</p>
<p>Then I'll see the text and then I'll open it so I won't have the little dot that says unread.</p>
<p>And sometimes I'll forget to get back to people entirely.</p>
<p>It's so bad.</p>
<p>It's so bad.</p>
<p>Lindsay, we're so...</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>It's so bad.</p>
<p>It's so bad.</p>
<p>Lindsay, we're so similar.</p>
<p>Really, it's terrible.</p>
<p>Anyway, but that is a good question.</p>
<p>So here's another one.</p>
<p>I'm in bed by blank, but I usually fall asleep at blank.</p>
<p>So interesting.</p>
<p>So in bed and falling asleep are different, right, Lindsay?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>In bed by 1030, usually falling asleep at 11.</p>
<p>And again, a very standard, common, everyday sentence, but we do share this stuff.</p>
<p>We do talk about this, right?</p>
<p>How fast do you fall asleep typically?</p>
<p>That's different for everyone.</p>
<p>I like the next one.</p>
<p>Night owl, morning person.</p>
<p>We've talked about this, Michelle.</p>
<p>I think you're a night owl.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I'm much more of a morning person.</p>
<p>I'm up by, these days I'm trying to sleep until seven, but then I'll take my dog out.</p>
<p>And I want to be outdoors early in the morning.</p>
<p>I just want to go outside, you know?</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>So yeah, and then you can ask somebody just if you want to open up.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>Ask somebody, just if you want to open up the conversation, what time do you usually go to sleep?</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>Or if we want to say something happened when you were asleep, a more creative way to say it, a more natural native way is to say, I was out.</p>
<p>Isn't that fun?</p>
<p>That's a fun one.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was out.</p>
<p>Or you could also say, I was passed out.</p>
<p>I was passed out.</p>
<p>Now, this doesn't mean you fainted, right?</p>
<p>It means you were asleep at that time.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So you could say, oh, I passed out or I was passed out.</p>
<p>I did not hear your text message, right?</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>So, Michelle, what about you?</p>
<p>What time do you usually go to sleep?</p>
<p>Well, I'm usually, it's gotten later and later, but I've been trying, I mean, honestly, more like one in the morning.</p>
<p>Whoa, that's way past my bedtime.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>Whoa, that's way past my bedtime.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Way past your bedtime, yeah.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>So I'm in bed by 12, but I usually put down my book and I usually kind of fall asleep at about 1. But yeah, I'm a night owl.</p>
<p>That's the truth.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>So you were saying about 10?</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm definitely a morning person.</p>
<p>So I want to be upstairs and getting ready for bed by 10 and then in bed by 10.30 and then hopefully lights out by 11.</p>
<p>But yeah, it doesn't always work.</p>
<p>Sometimes I have a hard time falling asleep, which is normal, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, Like how long does it usually take you?</p>
<p>Or do you ever have to get up and do something else?</p>
<p>No, I usually don't have to get up and do... Like sometimes it could be 10 minutes, sometimes it could be half an hour, something like that.</p>
<p>But, you know, trying to do the right things.</p>
<p>Like I know I've been reading a lot lately where they say you shouldn't eat</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>lately where they say you shouldn't eat too late.</p>
<p>But I work out late.</p>
<p>I work out at 6.45 until about 7.45.</p>
<p>So then I eat dinner after that.</p>
<p>So I'm eating at 8.39 and showering and then in bed at 10.</p>
<p>So it's like changing that routine is not easy, Michelle.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>That is tricky.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, the issue is in the morning when I wake up, I'm really out in the morning, right?</p>
<p>I am still passed out early.</p>
<p>Even my daughter comes into my room and she has to watch Daniel Tiger and start singing songs and I'm just out.</p>
<p>You are out.</p>
<p>I love how you said that.</p>
<p>That is so native and natural.</p>
<p>I am just out.</p>
<p>Yes, What time do you actually get out of bed then in the morning typically?</p>
<p>Oh, it really depends.</p>
<p>I mean, she was in our room today at, I think, 5.15.</p>
<p>That's not easy when you're going to bed at 1. Right, yes.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>Yes, that's a problem.</p>
<p>That's why I'm not that smart.</p>
<p>I should be going to sleep earlier.</p>
<p>But I would say that I usually I'm out of bed between like 630.</p>
<p>And then if Dan is with them, sometimes I can sleep.</p>
<p>I mean, today, like a little after eight.</p>
<p>But that's too late.</p>
<p>That's too late.</p>
<p>And then I'm always rushing.</p>
<p>That sounds luxurious to me to sleep until eight on a weekday morning.</p>
<p>But it's but sleeping until eight, that's also with that, you know, in between visit from my daughter.</p>
<p>Yeah, So yeah, this is.</p>
<p>And so I just want to let our listeners know how natural this conversation was that we've just been having.</p>
<p>So we've been trying to throw in a couple of the expressions we taught you guys.</p>
<p>But this is the conversation you're likely to have with a native speaker friend.</p>
<p>100 percent.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So hopefully you're taking notes, right?</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>Yes, All right.</p>
<p>Let's take a quick break and we'll</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>Yes, All right, let's take a quick break and we'll be back.</p>
<p>All right, Michelle, so why is this good for connection?</p>
<p>I mean, I know it comes up a lot among friends.</p>
<p>What else?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I mean, sharing routines can be fun and can also lead to sharing more information about yourself, right?</p>
<p>So I ended up sharing one thing and you end up telling a story, oh, this is what happened today, this is what happened to me over the weekend.</p>
<p>So you can show other parts of your life and your personality from something that seems as something so basic as when do you go to sleep?</p>
<p>It can just expand really endlessly.</p>
<p>And again, like Lindsay said, you're kind of checking to see what's normal or if you connect with someone, you do something totally the same or totally different.</p>
<p>That can just really bring up lots of things.</p>
<p>There's a really nice moment of connection that we feel.</p>
<p>It's almost like a dopamine hit when we realize that we have someone in our life who has a similar pattern, who sees life the same way.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>pattern who sees life the same way.</p>
<p>It's really cool.</p>
<p>And we shouldn't underestimate that.</p>
<p>And that's the beauty of learning a new language.</p>
<p>That's why we're here.</p>
<p>That's why this show exists.</p>
<p>It's connection.</p>
<p>It's the connection moment and how that feels on our hearts and our minds.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So the more we share, the more likely we are to find that moment.</p>
<p>It is so true.</p>
<p>I even have a friend that we both bite our nails.</p>
<p>And the other day, and sometimes we just connect on it and we'll say, oh, when do you typically do it?</p>
<p>Has this ever happened to you?</p>
<p>And I don't know, I felt so much more connected to her.</p>
<p>Even from something as silly as that.</p>
<p>That is so cool.</p>
<p>That is the cool thing about being human.</p>
<p>It's being able to connect with words in this way.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So let's do a role play, Michelle, a real role play to supplement what we've done before earlier in the episode.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So here we are friends in exercise class.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Oh, man, I'm tired today.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>I'm tired today.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>Late night?</p>
<p>Yeah, I stayed up until 2 a.m. Wow, that is way past my bedtime.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>What time do you usually go to sleep?</p>
<p>I'm in bed by 10, but I usually stay up reading and fall asleep at 11.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I was out by 2 a.m. Oh, that's good.</p>
<p>I'm a night owl.</p>
<p>I'm a morning person.</p>
<p>I usually pass out by 9. I wish.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It's like we did a role reversal.</p>
<p>We did a role reversal here.</p>
<p>I was surprised to see it, but I like it.</p>
<p>So we use that way.</p>
<p>Keep you on your toes.</p>
<p>Keep me on my toes.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>So the first thing you said, I said, I stayed up until 2 a.m. And you said, wow, that's way past my bedtime.</p>
<p>And there's a lot of fun we can have with that way, right?</p>
<p>That emphatic way.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And then you picked it up as a connection moment to expand on this.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>What time do you usually...</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>What time do you usually go to sleep?</p>
<p>Yeah, and you said, I'm in bed by 10, but I usually stay up reading and fall asleep at 11.</p>
<p>So it is a connection moment.</p>
<p>We've pivoted into another conversation here, right?</p>
<p>About our daily routines, nightly routines.</p>
<p>And then I said, yeah, so I was out by 2am.</p>
<p>So that's just a more slangy way to say, oh, I was sleeping deeply by 2am.</p>
<p>Yeah, very important slang to know, right?</p>
<p>You'll hear that.</p>
<p>And if you hear that, you don't know that it means you were asleep.</p>
<p>You'd think, what do you mean you were out?</p>
<p>You were going out.</p>
<p>It's confusing.</p>
<p>Going to a club at 2am?</p>
<p>You just said you were sleeping.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it can be confusing.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And I said, that's good.</p>
<p>I'm a night owl.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then I said, I'm a morning person.</p>
<p>I usually pass out by 9. And again, we don't mean faint here or fall on the ground.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>It does mean that in a different context, of course.</p>
<p>If you donate blood, you might pass out, right?</p>
<p>You might faint.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>Right, you might faint.</p>
<p>But in this case, it means I usually go to sleep.</p>
<p>It's actually fall asleep, right?</p>
<p>It's not really go to bed.</p>
<p>It's fall asleep.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>So guys, we are so excited because we are going to do a part two, but it's not going to be on the All Ears English podcast.</p>
