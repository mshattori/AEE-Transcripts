<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p id="p-10">One of the most common topics among native-speaking friends is sleeping routines.</p>
<p id="p-11">Listen in today to talk about your nighttime routines in English for more connection moments.</p>
<p id="p-12">Hey there, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-13">How's it going today?</p>
<p id="p-14">Oh, pretty good, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-15">How are you?</p>
<p id="p-16">I'm doing well.</p>
<p id="p-17">Did you sleep well last night?</p>
<p id="p-18">Um, I slept okay.</p>
<p id="p-19">I slept okay.</p>
<p id="p-20">I find that if everybody in my house is asleep earlier than usual, then everything goes better for me.</p>
<p id="p-21">What about you?</p>
<p id="p-22">Did you sleep well?</p>
<p id="p-23">I slept pretty well.</p>
<p id="p-24">I was under the covers.</p>
<p id="p-25">It's very cold in Denver right now.</p>
<p id="p-26">So I like to layer the covers on top of me, and that's nice.</p>
<p id="p-27">So I was nice and warm in bed, for sure, in bed by 10.</p>
<p id="p-28">Yes, Oh, in bed by 10.</p>
<p id="p-29">So was that?</p>
<p id="p-30">No, more like 1030, I guess.</p>
<p id="p-31">Yeah, Okay.</p>
<p id="p-32">So what time do you typically go to sleep?</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-33">What time do you typically go to sleep?</p>
<p id="p-34">Is that a typical night?</p>
<p id="p-35">Yeah, I think 10.</p>
<p id="p-36">I try to be upstairs and getting ready for bed by 10 and maybe in bed by 1030, something like that.</p>
<p id="p-37">I'm just trying to get a little bit more sleep these days.</p>
<p id="p-38">Yes, Yeah, it's so hard.</p>
<p id="p-39">It's so hard when you just want to have some time to relax.</p>
<p id="p-40">But do you have a sleep routine?</p>
<p id="p-41">You were saying, oh, you're upstairs at 10, maybe in bed by 1030.</p>
<p id="p-42">Yeah, I try to do some meditation, some sitting meditation for about 15 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-43">And then I brush my teeth, get ready, get into bed, read my book a little bit.</p>
<p id="p-44">It's a whole thing.</p>
<p id="p-45">It is a bit of a routine, right?</p>
<p id="p-46">You kind of need that routine to tell your body to calm down and get ready for sleep.</p>
<p id="p-47">Yes, Yeah, right.</p>
<p id="p-48">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-49">Are you a nighttime shower or a morning shower?</p>
<p id="p-50">I kind of do both, actually.</p>
<p id="p-51">If I work out, I'll shower before bed and then I'll wake up again and shower again in the morning.</p>
<p id="p-52">So that means dry skin.</p>
<p id="p-53">Yes,</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-54">That means dry skin.</p>
<p id="p-55">Yes, Okay, so today we are going to talk about a very common topic, and this is actually part one of a two-part series.</p>
<p id="p-56">So this is about bedtime and bedtime routines because I realized that this is just an extremely common connection topic.</p>
<p id="p-57">It really is.</p>
<p id="p-58">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-59">Maybe it's my age, but I find that I talk about this a lot with my friends.</p>
<p id="p-60">Oh, what time do you go to sleep?</p>
<p id="p-61">Everyone's excited.</p>
<p id="p-62">Well, I just think there's a lot of research coming out on how important sleep is now, right?</p>
<p id="p-63">And people are consuming this research and reading about it and rethinking their routines.</p>
<p id="p-64">That's what people are doing.</p>
<p id="p-65">They're rethinking what they're consuming, how they're sleeping, how they're living.</p>
<p id="p-66">So I think it makes sense that it's a common topic, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-67">Yeah, Would you say sometimes you talk about this with your friends?</p>
<p id="p-68">Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-69">Because you also want to get a check on your life.</p>
<p id="p-70">Am I normal?</p>
<p id="p-71">You think that's what we're doing on a very philosophical level?</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-72">like philosophical level as human beings when we're asking other people about their routine?</p>
<p id="p-73">You want to know if what you're doing is normal, right?</p>
<p id="p-74">That's funny.</p>
<p id="p-75">Yeah, I didn't think about that, but I guess that's true.</p>
<p id="p-76">You're just kind of checking, okay, is this?</p>
<p id="p-77">Everything I'm doing, is that okay?</p>
<p id="p-78">Yeah, So, well, that's what we're going to talk about today.</p>
<p id="p-79">We're going to talk about how to share this information, how to connect over this topic in English, because it is very common.</p>
<p id="p-80">Yes, So, I'm excited for today's episode.</p>
<p id="p-81">So, let's talk about some expressions that you would use to either share information or ask about someone's bedtime routine.</p>
<p id="p-82">So, let's go for it.</p>
<p id="p-83">So, I think that this was actually inspired by me saying or hearing this expression, that's past my bedtime, or you could also say that's way past my bedtime.</p>
<p id="p-84">What do you think of this?</p>
<p id="p-85">Way past my bedtime.</p>
<p id="p-86">I like it.</p>
<p id="p-87">I like it.</p>
<p id="p-88">Yeah, so you're</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-89">I like it.</p>
<p id="p-90">Yeah, so you're really emphasizing something is happening after you're going to be in bed, so you won't be able to attend whatever it is, right?</p>
<p id="p-91">Right, So for example, if somebody says to you, oh, could I give you a call at around 10.30 tonight?</p>
<p id="p-92">You could say, oh, no, that's way past my bedtime.</p>
<p id="p-93">Let's talk tomorrow.</p>
<p id="p-94">Yeah, Oh, here's a question, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-95">What are your thoughts on this?</p>
<p id="p-96">Hot takes.</p>
<p id="p-97">Is it okay to text people after, let's say, 9 p.m. local time?</p>
<p id="p-98">Because do you assume that they have their phone silenced?</p>
<p id="p-99">Is it their responsibility or should you not text until the next day?</p>
<p id="p-100">Such a good question.</p>
<p id="p-101">Yes, Something that I think about a lot, actually, because I realized, I mean, this happens a lot.</p>
<p id="p-102">So typically, this is bad, but I have a very hard time texting people during the day.</p>
<p id="p-103">I'm just busy.</p>
<p id="p-104">I have a hard time responding to messages during the day because I'm running around.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-105">during the day because I'm running around and I try not to be, I mean, yeah, I look at my phone, but I want to give a text message the attention it deserves if I want to really respond to someone.</p>
<p id="p-106">So a lot of times what happens is I get into bed at night and I would just want to write back to some people, but then I always think, oh, is it too late?</p>
<p id="p-107">Right, Right, Oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-108">Yes, Good question.</p>
<p id="p-109">So we have no answer though.</p>
<p id="p-110">So we have no, what do you think?</p>
<p id="p-111">Sometimes you can see if somebody's notifications are silent.</p>
<p id="p-112">Right, And then I'm very happy.</p>
<p id="p-113">I can do it.</p>
<p id="p-114">Sometimes I'll write to them.</p>
<p id="p-115">I hope I'm not waking you.</p>
<p id="p-116">Or sometimes I'll wait till the next day, but then it usually doesn't happen.</p>
<p id="p-117">Right, That's the problem.</p>
<p id="p-118">You might forget about it.</p>
<p id="p-119">I've definitely been known to do that.</p>
<p id="p-120">I also am the same way.</p>
<p id="p-121">I don't like to text back.</p>
<p id="p-122">I'm busy.</p>
<p id="p-123">Then I'll see the text and then I'll open it so I won't have the little dot that says unread.</p>
<p id="p-124">And sometimes I'll forget to get back to people entirely.</p>
<p id="p-125">It's so bad.</p>
<p id="p-126">It's so bad.</p>
<p id="p-127">Lindsay, we're so...</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-128">It's so bad.</p>
<p id="p-129">It's so bad.</p>
<p id="p-130">Lindsay, we're so similar.</p>
<p id="p-131">Really, it's terrible.</p>
<p id="p-132">Anyway, but that is a good question.</p>
<p id="p-133">So here's another one.</p>
<p id="p-134">I'm in bed by blank, but I usually fall asleep at blank.</p>
<p id="p-135">So interesting.</p>
<p id="p-136">So in bed and falling asleep are different, right, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-137">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-138">In bed by 1030, usually falling asleep at 11.</p>
<p id="p-139">And again, a very standard, common, everyday sentence, but we do share this stuff.</p>
<p id="p-140">We do talk about this, right?</p>
<p id="p-141">How fast do you fall asleep typically?</p>
<p id="p-142">That's different for everyone.</p>
<p id="p-143">I like the next one.</p>
<p id="p-144">Night owl, morning person.</p>
<p id="p-145">We've talked about this, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-146">I think you're a night owl.</p>
<p id="p-147">Is that right?</p>
<p id="p-148">Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-149">I'm much more of a morning person.</p>
<p id="p-150">I'm up by, these days I'm trying to sleep until seven, but then I'll take my dog out.</p>
<p id="p-151">And I want to be outdoors early in the morning.</p>
<p id="p-152">I just want to go outside, you know?</p>
<p id="p-153">Yes, yes.</p>
<p id="p-154">So yeah, and then you can ask somebody just if you want to open up.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-155">Ask somebody, just if you want to open up the conversation, what time do you usually go to sleep?</p>
<p id="p-156">Perfect.</p>
<p id="p-157">Or if we want to say something happened when you were asleep, a more creative way to say it, a more natural native way is to say, I was out.</p>
<p id="p-158">Isn't that fun?</p>
<p id="p-159">That's a fun one.</p>
<p id="p-160">Yeah, I was out.</p>
<p id="p-161">Or you could also say, I was passed out.</p>
<p id="p-162">I was passed out.</p>
<p id="p-163">Now, this doesn't mean you fainted, right?</p>
<p id="p-164">It means you were asleep at that time.</p>
<p id="p-165">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-166">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-167">So you could say, oh, I passed out or I was passed out.</p>
<p id="p-168">I did not hear your text message, right?</p>
<p id="p-169">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-170">So, Michelle, what about you?</p>
<p id="p-171">What time do you usually go to sleep?</p>
<p id="p-172">Well, I'm usually, it's gotten later and later, but I've been trying, I mean, honestly, more like one in the morning.</p>
<p id="p-173">Whoa, that's way past my bedtime.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-174">Whoa, that's way past my bedtime.</p>
<p id="p-175">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-176">Way past your bedtime, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-177">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-178">So I'm in bed by 12, but I usually put down my book and I usually kind of fall asleep at about 1. But yeah, I'm a night owl.</p>
<p id="p-179">That's the truth.</p>
<p id="p-180">What about you?</p>
<p id="p-181">So you were saying about 10?</p>
<p id="p-182">Yeah, I'm definitely a morning person.</p>
<p id="p-183">So I want to be upstairs and getting ready for bed by 10 and then in bed by 10.30 and then hopefully lights out by 11.</p>
<p id="p-184">But yeah, it doesn't always work.</p>
<p id="p-185">Sometimes I have a hard time falling asleep, which is normal, you know?</p>
<p id="p-186">Yeah, Like how long does it usually take you?</p>
<p id="p-187">Or do you ever have to get up and do something else?</p>
<p id="p-188">No, I usually don't have to get up and do... Like sometimes it could be 10 minutes, sometimes it could be half an hour, something like that.</p>
<p id="p-189">But, you know, trying to do the right things.</p>
<p id="p-190">Like I know I've been reading a lot lately where they say you shouldn't eat</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-191">lately where they say you shouldn't eat too late.</p>
<p id="p-192">But I work out late.</p>
<p id="p-193">I work out at 6.45 until about 7.45.</p>
<p id="p-194">So then I eat dinner after that.</p>
<p id="p-195">So I'm eating at 8.39 and showering and then in bed at 10.</p>
<p id="p-196">So it's like changing that routine is not easy, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-197">Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p id="p-198">That is tricky.</p>
<p id="p-199">But yeah, I mean, the issue is in the morning when I wake up, I'm really out in the morning, right?</p>
<p id="p-200">I am still passed out early.</p>
<p id="p-201">Even my daughter comes into my room and she has to watch Daniel Tiger and start singing songs and I'm just out.</p>
<p id="p-202">You are out.</p>
<p id="p-203">I love how you said that.</p>
<p id="p-204">That is so native and natural.</p>
<p id="p-205">I am just out.</p>
<p id="p-206">Yes, What time do you actually get out of bed then in the morning typically?</p>
<p id="p-207">Oh, it really depends.</p>
<p id="p-208">I mean, she was in our room today at, I think, 5.15.</p>
<p id="p-209">That's not easy when you're going to bed at 1. Right, yes.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-210">Yes, that's a problem.</p>
<p id="p-211">That's why I'm not that smart.</p>
<p id="p-212">I should be going to sleep earlier.</p>
<p id="p-213">But I would say that I usually I'm out of bed between like 630.</p>
<p id="p-214">And then if Dan is with them, sometimes I can sleep.</p>
<p id="p-215">I mean, today, like a little after eight.</p>
<p id="p-216">But that's too late.</p>
<p id="p-217">That's too late.</p>
<p id="p-218">And then I'm always rushing.</p>
<p id="p-219">That sounds luxurious to me to sleep until eight on a weekday morning.</p>
<p id="p-220">But it's but sleeping until eight, that's also with that, you know, in between visit from my daughter.</p>
<p id="p-221">Yeah, So yeah, this is.</p>
<p id="p-222">And so I just want to let our listeners know how natural this conversation was that we've just been having.</p>
<p id="p-223">So we've been trying to throw in a couple of the expressions we taught you guys.</p>
<p id="p-224">But this is the conversation you're likely to have with a native speaker friend.</p>
<p id="p-225">100 percent.</p>
<p id="p-226">Oh, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-227">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-228">So hopefully you're taking notes, right?</p>
<p id="p-229">Please.</p>
<p id="p-230">Yes, All right.</p>
<p id="p-231">Let's take a quick break and we'll</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-232">Yes, All right, let's take a quick break and we'll be back.</p>
<p id="p-233">All right, Michelle, so why is this good for connection?</p>
<p id="p-234">I mean, I know it comes up a lot among friends.</p>
<p id="p-235">What else?</p>
<p id="p-236">Yeah, well, I mean, sharing routines can be fun and can also lead to sharing more information about yourself, right?</p>
<p id="p-237">So I ended up sharing one thing and you end up telling a story, oh, this is what happened today, this is what happened to me over the weekend.</p>
<p id="p-238">So you can show other parts of your life and your personality from something that seems as something so basic as when do you go to sleep?</p>
<p id="p-239">It can just expand really endlessly.</p>
<p id="p-240">And again, like Lindsay said, you're kind of checking to see what's normal or if you connect with someone, you do something totally the same or totally different.</p>
<p id="p-241">That can just really bring up lots of things.</p>
<p id="p-242">There's a really nice moment of connection that we feel.</p>
<p id="p-243">It's almost like a dopamine hit when we realize that we have someone in our life who has a similar pattern, who sees life the same way.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-244">pattern who sees life the same way.</p>
<p id="p-245">It's really cool.</p>
<p id="p-246">And we shouldn't underestimate that.</p>
<p id="p-247">And that's the beauty of learning a new language.</p>
<p id="p-248">That's why we're here.</p>
<p id="p-249">That's why this show exists.</p>
<p id="p-250">It's connection.</p>
<p id="p-251">It's the connection moment and how that feels on our hearts and our minds.</p>
<p id="p-252">Right?</p>
<p id="p-253">So the more we share, the more likely we are to find that moment.</p>
<p id="p-254">It is so true.</p>
<p id="p-255">I even have a friend that we both bite our nails.</p>
<p id="p-256">And the other day, and sometimes we just connect on it and we'll say, oh, when do you typically do it?</p>
<p id="p-257">Has this ever happened to you?</p>
<p id="p-258">And I don't know, I felt so much more connected to her.</p>
<p id="p-259">Even from something as silly as that.</p>
<p id="p-260">That is so cool.</p>
<p id="p-261">That is the cool thing about being human.</p>
<p id="p-262">It's being able to connect with words in this way.</p>
<p id="p-263">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-264">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-265">So let's do a role play, Michelle, a real role play to supplement what we've done before earlier in the episode.</p>
<p id="p-266">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-267">All right.</p>
<p id="p-268">So here we are friends in exercise class.</p>
<p id="p-269">All right.</p>
<p id="p-270">Oh, man, I'm tired today.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-271">I'm tired today.</p>
<p id="p-272">Oh, really?</p>
<p id="p-273">Late night?</p>
<p id="p-274">Yeah, I stayed up until 2 a.m. Wow, that is way past my bedtime.</p>
<p id="p-275">Oh, really?</p>
<p id="p-276">What time do you usually go to sleep?</p>
<p id="p-277">I'm in bed by 10, but I usually stay up reading and fall asleep at 11.</p>
<p id="p-278">Oh, okay.</p>
<p id="p-279">Yeah, so I was out by 2 a.m. Oh, that's good.</p>
<p id="p-280">I'm a night owl.</p>
<p id="p-281">I'm a morning person.</p>
<p id="p-282">I usually pass out by 9. I wish.</p>
<p id="p-283">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-284">It's like we did a role reversal.</p>
<p id="p-285">We did a role reversal here.</p>
<p id="p-286">I was surprised to see it, but I like it.</p>
<p id="p-287">So we use that way.</p>
<p id="p-288">Keep you on your toes.</p>
<p id="p-289">Keep me on my toes.</p>
<p id="p-290">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-291">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-292">So the first thing you said, I said, I stayed up until 2 a.m. And you said, wow, that's way past my bedtime.</p>
<p id="p-293">And there's a lot of fun we can have with that way, right?</p>
<p id="p-294">That emphatic way.</p>
<p id="p-295">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-296">And then you picked it up as a connection moment to expand on this.</p>
<p id="p-297">Oh, really?</p>
<p id="p-298">What time do you usually...</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-299">Oh, really?</p>
<p id="p-300">What time do you usually go to sleep?</p>
<p id="p-301">Yeah, and you said, I'm in bed by 10, but I usually stay up reading and fall asleep at 11.</p>
<p id="p-302">So it is a connection moment.</p>
<p id="p-303">We've pivoted into another conversation here, right?</p>
<p id="p-304">About our daily routines, nightly routines.</p>
<p id="p-305">And then I said, yeah, so I was out by 2am.</p>
<p id="p-306">So that's just a more slangy way to say, oh, I was sleeping deeply by 2am.</p>
<p id="p-307">Yeah, very important slang to know, right?</p>
<p id="p-308">You'll hear that.</p>
<p id="p-309">And if you hear that, you don't know that it means you were asleep.</p>
<p id="p-310">You'd think, what do you mean you were out?</p>
<p id="p-311">You were going out.</p>
<p id="p-312">It's confusing.</p>
<p id="p-313">Going to a club at 2am?</p>
<p id="p-314">You just said you were sleeping.</p>
<p id="p-315">Yeah, so it can be confusing.</p>
<p id="p-316">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-317">And I said, that's good.</p>
<p id="p-318">I'm a night owl.</p>
<p id="p-319">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-320">And then I said, I'm a morning person.</p>
<p id="p-321">I usually pass out by 9. And again, we don't mean faint here or fall on the ground.</p>
<p id="p-322">No, no.</p>
<p id="p-323">It does mean that in a different context, of course.</p>
<p id="p-324">If you donate blood, you might pass out, right?</p>
<p id="p-325">You might faint.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-326">Right, you might faint.</p>
<p id="p-327">But in this case, it means I usually go to sleep.</p>
<p id="p-328">It's actually fall asleep, right?</p>
<p id="p-329">It's not really go to bed.</p>
<p id="p-330">It's fall asleep.</p>
<p id="p-331">Yeah, right.</p>
<p id="p-332">Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-333">So guys, we are so excited because we are going to do a part two, but it's not going to be on the All Ears English podcast.</p>
<p id="p-334">Guys, head on over to the Business English podcast where we are going to talk about how to share your mornings with someone, how to connect over mornings.</p>
<p id="p-335">So especially weekday mornings when things are kind of crazy.</p>
<p id="p-336">And so this is if you are not looking for help with business English, you still want to look for this episode because business English is human English, right?</p>
<p id="p-337">We don't just talk about things that are only for the office.</p>
<p id="p-338">We talk about lots of different things in there that you can use in your regular life as well.</p>
<p id="p-339">So this will be definitely helpful for you.</p>
<p id="p-340">So go on over, hit follow on the Business English podcast and that episode will be coming to you pretty soon.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-341">And that episode will be coming to you pretty soon.</p>
<p id="p-342">Yes, I'm super excited to listen to that episode and create that episode for our listeners.</p>
<p id="p-343">So guys, go over and hit follow on Business English and we will see you again very soon back here on this show.</p>
<p id="p-344">All right.</p>
<p id="p-345">All right.</p>
