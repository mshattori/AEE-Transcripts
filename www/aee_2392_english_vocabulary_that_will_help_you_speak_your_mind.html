<p id="p-16">Hello, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-17">How are you?</p>
<p id="p-18">I'm doing pretty well today, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-19">What's shaking?</p>
<p id="p-20">What's happening for you today?</p>
<p id="p-21">Not too much.</p>
<p id="p-22">I actually leave tomorrow for a trip to Mexico, just Rocky Point, but for spring break.</p>
<p id="p-23">I'm excited.</p>
<p id="p-24">That is so exciting.</p>
<p id="p-25">Yeah, it's good to travel in the springtime, you know?</p>
<p id="p-26">Yes, though I was just</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-27">You know?</p>
<p id="p-28">Yes, though, I was just looking at the weather, and it's chillier than it usually is.</p>
<p id="p-29">It's like high 60s, low 70s, and I have friends coming from up north that really wanted some warmth and sunshine, so it might be chillier than they want, but better than those sub-zero temperatures they've been dealing with.</p>
<p id="p-30">Yeah, I mean, you can still hang on the beach in jeans and sweatshirts, and it's fun, you know what I mean?</p>
<p id="p-31">Sure, it'll still be fun.</p>
<p id="p-32">Yeah, you'll have fun.</p>
<p id="p-33">It'll be great.</p>
<p id="p-34">All right, I have a question for you here, Lindsay, to start us out.</p>
<p id="p-35">Are you good at speaking your mind?</p>
<p id="p-36">I would say I've gotten better at it for sure as I've gotten older.</p>
<p id="p-37">Just the other night, I was at a steakhouse with my partner and my partner's friend, and this friend has slightly different political views than I do.</p>
<p id="p-38">Not completely different.</p>
<p id="p-39">We're in the same spectrum, but just slightly different.</p>
<p id="p-40">And so I think I did a pretty good job of pushing back and kind of speaking my mind.</p>
<p id="p-41">Yeah, Okay, nice.</p>
<p id="p-42">Yeah, I agree, right?</p>
<p id="p-43">The older I get, the more I'm willing to do that.</p>
<p id="p-44">I still try to be calm.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-45">I'm willing to do that.</p>
<p id="p-46">I still try to be careful of feelings, but I'm more likely to speak my mind than I did as a young person.</p>
<p id="p-47">And I think that's normal.</p>
<p id="p-48">I think our listeners probably resonate with that, too.</p>
<p id="p-49">As we get to know who we are as people over time, we go through different experiences.</p>
<p id="p-50">We gain that confidence, right?</p>
<p id="p-51">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-52">Yeah, Oh, this is a great phrase to talk about, speaking your mind.</p>
<p id="p-53">And we got a really good question from a listener over on YouTube about do you mind, right?</p>
<p id="p-54">And if that's polite.</p>
<p id="p-55">There are so many idioms in English with the word mind.</p>
<p id="p-56">So today we're diving into a few of these.</p>
<p id="p-57">I'm very excited.</p>
<p id="p-58">These are fun phrases.</p>
<p id="p-59">Yeah, this is really good.</p>
<p id="p-60">So, guys, go ahead and hit the follow button right now on All Ears English so you don't miss a single one of our episodes, right?</p>
<p id="p-61">And this one, I know we did cover the – I just want to make sure our listeners know that this is a different episode from 2390, right?</p>
<p id="p-62">Yes, we're talking about – in 2390, we talked about do you mind</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-63">We talked about do you mind and how you can accidentally sound rude and the difference between I don't care and I don't mind and a few different idioms there.</p>
<p id="p-64">There are so many.</p>
<p id="p-65">So we are doing a series.</p>
<p id="p-66">This is part two of a series with idioms that have mind, but you can listen to them out of order.</p>
<p id="p-67">So if you haven't heard 2390 yet, just listen here.</p>
<p id="p-68">Then you can go back and get that one.</p>
<p id="p-69">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-70">So stay right here in this episode.</p>
<p id="p-71">Continue and then go back later.</p>
<p id="p-72">But this is a completely different episode, even though we're talking again about the word mind.</p>
<p id="p-73">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-74">Yeah, So let's dive in with speak your mind first.</p>
<p id="p-75">Yes, This means to say what you are thinking.</p>
<p id="p-76">And there's definitely an implication here that what you say people might not like.</p>
<p id="p-77">Like this conversation you had where you have different political views.</p>
<p id="p-78">It's a lot easier just to agree and nod along.</p>
<p id="p-79">If you're going to speak your mind, the people you're talking to might disagree.</p>
<p id="p-80">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-81">So for example, I think everyone</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-82">So for example, I think everyone should speak their mind to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<p id="p-83">Yes, Or, you know, speak your mind.</p>
<p id="p-84">I can tell you're not telling me something.</p>
<p id="p-85">So it's definitely different than like just telling someone like, I guess the words would be the same, but there's this implication that something is being hidden or for some reason someone's not comfortable saying something.</p>
<p id="p-86">If you say speak your mind, it means like out with it.</p>
<p id="p-87">Or that something is going to be controversial or people aren't going to agree.</p>
<p id="p-88">It's all about pushing back and sharing what we truly believe.</p>
<p id="p-89">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-90">We wouldn't say this if we're saying something that everyone agrees with or you're just saying, I'm going to make dinner now.</p>
<p id="p-91">You would be like, I really spoke my mind.</p>
<p id="p-92">No, right?</p>
<p id="p-93">You're just talking.</p>
<p id="p-94">That's very different.</p>
<p id="p-95">It's more controversial stuff for sure.</p>
<p id="p-96">Yeah, Next one is mind your own business.</p>
<p id="p-97">Very common, right?</p>
<p id="p-98">And this means, you know, don't worry about what people are doing, right?</p>
<p id="p-99">Pay attention to your life and what matters.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-100">pay attention to your life and what matters for you.</p>
<p id="p-101">So for example, I try to mind my own business, but I felt like I had to say something.</p>
<p id="p-102">Yes, Or someone might just say, mind your own business.</p>
<p id="p-103">If someone's asking, like prying, someone's asking something you don't, then maybe playfully, you could be like, okay, mind your own business.</p>
<p id="p-104">I'm not gonna answer that question.</p>
<p id="p-105">Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-106">In American culture, I think we have a big value of privacy, right?</p>
<p id="p-107">We have, I don't know, space between homes and things like that.</p>
<p id="p-108">And people try to respect people's privacy and not asking prying questions, like about finances, right?</p>
<p id="p-109">Right, and this might be tricky if it's different in your culture.</p>
<p id="p-110">You might be used to asking personal questions, talking about finances.</p>
<p id="p-111">And then if you have friends from the US, it would be good to keep in mind, yeah, there are a lot of questions that are too personal.</p>
<p id="p-112">Yeah, and if someone said this, if you were prying, if you were asking, let's say, questions about someone's finances, the wrong questions.</p>
<p id="p-113">We've done other episodes where certain questions you can kind of ask,</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-114">questions you can kind of ask, but others you shouldn't. If someone said directly to you, mind your own business, that's very direct and quite rude, and I wouldn't recommend saying that to someone, right?</p>
<p id="p-115">Let's make sure we clarify that, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-116">Yeah, that's a good point, right?</p>
<p id="p-117">To say this directly to someone's face, to tell them, you know, don't ask me these personal questions is very rude, is very blunt.</p>
<p id="p-118">There are more polite ways to say that for sure, but we might say this about someone else, like, can you believe he asked me that?</p>
<p id="p-119">I wish he would mind his own business.</p>
<p id="p-120">Right, right.</p>
<p id="p-121">Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-122">Or I try to mind my own business.</p>
<p id="p-123">That's a good example, but directly saying, mind your own business.</p>
<p id="p-124">Don't ask me that question.</p>
<p id="p-125">That's too much.</p>
<p id="p-126">It's very much too much, right?</p>
<p id="p-127">This could hurt connections, actually.</p>
<p id="p-128">Instead, we could say, oh, you know, I don't feel comfortable answering that question or just change the subject, right?</p>
<p id="p-129">There are polite ways to do that for sure.</p>
<p id="p-130">For sure.</p>
<p id="p-131">All right, what's our next one, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-132">All right, out of your mind, which means acting irrational or being crazy, maybe</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-133">or being crazy maybe, we usually say this more playfully to be funny or to exaggerate.</p>
<p id="p-134">I might say, I may be out of my mind, but I thought I heard you say the meeting was Wednesday.</p>
<p id="p-135">This is kind of a fun way of being like, am I crazy?</p>
<p id="p-136">Did I miss something?</p>
<p id="p-137">Yeah, this can mean a lot of different things, just in a sense of did I miss that detail or am I acting really irrationally?</p>
<p id="p-138">You know, someone's throwing things around the house.</p>
<p id="p-139">You're out of your mind.</p>
<p id="p-140">What are you doing?</p>
<p id="p-141">It can mean a whole range of behaviors when you say that, right?</p>
<p id="p-142">And another caveat with this one, just like mind your own business, that it can be very rude to just say to someone, are you out of your mind?</p>
<p id="p-143">Right?</p>
<p id="p-144">It's definitely pretty harsh.</p>
<p id="p-145">Like you're implying that someone is crazy, is not thinking clearly.</p>
<p id="p-146">People I think will say this when they're fighting with someone.</p>
<p id="p-147">So you should be careful because it can be offensive.</p>
<p id="p-148">Yeah, these are heavy, heavy responses for sure.</p>
<p id="p-149">The next one's a little lighter.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-150">The next one's a little lighter.</p>
<p id="p-151">Peace of mind.</p>
<p id="p-152">I like this.</p>
<p id="p-153">It's a state of mental calmness, and we all want this, right?</p>
<p id="p-154">Right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-155">And you might say, for my peace of mind, can you check that all the doors are locked?</p>
<p id="p-156">This is a very nice, polite way.</p>
<p id="p-157">You're just like, just so that I feel 100% secure about something.</p>
<p id="p-158">Yeah, you just don't want something on your mind kind of nagging at you.</p>
<p id="p-159">So you want to eliminate those issues.</p>
<p id="p-160">Or it gave him peace of mind to know that his mother was comfortable.</p>
<p id="p-161">Okay, good.</p>
<p id="p-162">So maybe like if your mother, you hire a nurse, and you know that she's taken care of better, right?</p>
<p id="p-163">Maybe she's elderly and needing that help.</p>
<p id="p-164">That would give you peace of mind to know that they have 24-hour care, maybe.</p>
<p id="p-165">For sure.</p>
<p id="p-166">For sure.</p>
<p id="p-167">100%. Love it.</p>
<p id="p-168">Okay, Aubrey, let's see how these all shake out in a real conversation.</p>
<p id="p-169">So we are quarreling, meaning what?</p>
<p id="p-170">Quarreling.</p>
<p id="p-171">Yeah, meaning we are arguing, right?</p>
<p id="p-172">We often say this.</p>
<p id="p-173">I say quarreling.</p>
<p id="p-174">Quarreling.</p>
<p id="p-175">But you're probably right.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-176">You're probably right.</p>
<p id="p-177">You're probably right.</p>
<p id="p-178">You know, it's often we say this for siblings when they're quarreling.</p>
<p id="p-179">Love that.</p>
<p id="p-180">All right, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-181">I'll start.</p>
<p id="p-182">I can tell you're upset about something.</p>
<p id="p-183">Go on, speak your mind.</p>
<p id="p-184">Mind your own business.</p>
<p id="p-185">If I wanted to say something, I would.</p>
<p id="p-186">That surprises me.</p>
<p id="p-187">You're usually quick to give everyone a piece of your mind.</p>
<p id="p-188">Are you out of your mind?</p>
<p id="p-189">You're the one always bossing everyone around.</p>
<p id="p-190">Okay, look, I'm sorry.</p>
<p id="p-191">I didn't mean that.</p>
<p id="p-192">I'm having a rough day and took it out on you.</p>
<p id="p-193">I'm sorry too.</p>
<p id="p-194">I shouldn't have snapped at you.</p>
<p id="p-195">If you're willing, I would like to hear what you're upset about.</p>
<p id="p-196">I'd like to help if I can.</p>
<p id="p-197">And it might give you peace of mind to talk to someone.</p>
<p id="p-198">Ah, sounds like siblings, right?</p>
<p id="p-199">It does sound like siblings.</p>
<p id="p-200">We're going to be sisters fighting because like we said, a couple of these are rude.</p>
<p id="p-201">Like siblings might say it to each other, but you would never say it to a coworker or even like a friend.</p>
<p id="p-202">Mind your own business, you mean specifically?</p>
<p id="p-203">Yeah, no, no, no way.</p>
<p id="p-204">Yeah, I might have said that to my brother when we were young or even now.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-205">When we were young, or even now, I don't know if I'm close enough to my brother even right now to say that to him if he were asking questions.</p>
<p id="p-206">But in this scenario, we're closer siblings, right?</p>
<p id="p-207">Right, Or even, are you out of your mind?</p>
<p id="p-208">You're the one always bossing everyone around.</p>
<p id="p-209">My children would say this to each other when I was younger, I would say it.</p>
<p id="p-210">But yeah, there is a level of immaturity with some of these phrases too, as we get older, as we mature, we're more respectful.</p>
<p id="p-211">We have other ways to say these.</p>
<p id="p-212">Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-213">So you started by saying, I can tell you're upset about something.</p>
<p id="p-214">Go on, speak your mind, right?</p>
<p id="p-215">Go ahead, say what it is.</p>
<p id="p-216">Say what it is you're thinking.</p>
<p id="p-217">And then you said, mind your own business.</p>
<p id="p-218">I really snapped at you, right?</p>
<p id="p-219">I really snapped there.</p>
<p id="p-220">And then a bonus here, I said, you're usually quick to give everyone a piece of your mind.</p>
<p id="p-221">This means to tell someone what one thinks of them, especially in anger, right?</p>
<p id="p-222">If you're upset and then you give them a piece of your mind.</p>
<p id="p-223">Yes, you're kind of taunting me here a little bit, right?</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-224">taunting me here a little bit, right?</p>
<p id="p-225">You're saying this is usually what you do, so why aren't you speaking now?</p>
<p id="p-226">Come on.</p>
<p id="p-227">And there's a fun phrase people will say where they say, I'd like to give you a piece of my mind.</p>
<p id="p-228">It's just sort of like, I want to tell you what I really think about you.</p>
<p id="p-229">And that's kind of a threat, a bit kind of like a physical threat too, sort of sometimes, right?</p>
<p id="p-230">Oh, maybe, right?</p>
<p id="p-231">We definitely hear this when people are angered, right?</p>
<p id="p-232">When emotions are heightened.</p>
<p id="p-233">A lot of these are for when we're upset.</p>
<p id="p-234">And then I said, are you out of your mind?</p>
<p id="p-235">You're the one always bossing everyone around.</p>
<p id="p-236">Now we really sound like siblings, right?</p>
<p id="p-237">I know, it's so true, right?</p>
<p id="p-238">Are you out of your mind means are you crazy?</p>
<p id="p-239">Are you not thinking rationally?</p>
<p id="p-240">Yeah, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-241">And then what's the last thing you said, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-242">I said, it might give you peace of mind to talk to someone.</p>
<p id="p-243">So we're starting to, we're apologizing, emotions are de-escalating.</p>
<p id="p-244">And I'm like, let's talk it out.</p>
<p id="p-245">I can tell you're upset about something and it might give you peace of mind.</p>
<p id="p-246">It might help calm you and make you feel better about it if you talk to somebody.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-247">You feel better about it if you talk to somebody.</p>
<p id="p-248">Yeah, and Aubrey, when you need to talk, does that help you to talk through things or is it better like just to go for a run?</p>
<p id="p-249">Like, how do you kind of work through things?</p>
<p id="p-250">Is it talking?</p>
<p id="p-251">Is it like physical movement?</p>
<p id="p-252">It depends.</p>
<p id="p-253">I think some things are just going to sort of like build up until you're able to talk about it.</p>
<p id="p-254">But other things, you maybe can just go for a run and move past it.</p>
<p id="p-255">So we have to pick our battles, right?</p>
<p id="p-256">That's right.</p>
<p id="p-257">Especially as a mom.</p>
<p id="p-258">Oh, I can imagine.</p>
<p id="p-259">All right, guys, don't forget to go back after you finish today.</p>
<p id="p-260">Check out All There's English 2390 just a few days ago, completely different episode on other ways to use the word mind, right?</p>
<p id="p-261">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-262">And part three will be on business English 403 with come to mind, bear in mind.</p>
<p id="p-263">So be sure to follow both podcasts so you get all of the most common expressions that we use with the word mind.</p>
<p id="p-264">Yeah, and I think the most important takeaway is know which words are too much for certain situations.</p>
<p id="p-265">Like mind your own business is</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-266">like mind your own business is too much for 95% of the scenarios we're going to be in, right?</p>
<p id="p-267">Right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-268">But a lot of these like peace of mind, it's really tricky.</p>
<p id="p-269">It really depends for all of these phrases.</p>
<p id="p-270">Some of them you can use anytime and there's no negative collocation.</p>
<p id="p-271">Yeah, and I think we've done an episode before on if you're thinking mind your own business, what could you actually say?</p>
<p id="p-272">So come back to our blog and Google that inside our search bar and see what you can find.</p>
<p id="p-273">If not, send us a question, a very direct question, and we'll make a new episode about it.</p>
