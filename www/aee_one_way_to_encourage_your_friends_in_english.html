<p>When a friend comes to you and is unsure...</p>
<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p>When a friend comes to you and is unsure about something, what can you say to make them feel more positive and energized?</p>
<p>Today, get one key phrase to do this and build connection.</p>
<p>Hi, Lindsay, how are you?</p>
<p>Excellent, Michelle, how are you doing?</p>
<p>I'm good, thanks.</p>
<p>Lindsay, do you think there are any definites in life?</p>
<p>Are there any definites in life?</p>
<p>Well, what is that saying that's so famous?</p>
<p>The only thing you can count on in life is death and taxes.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So I suppose those things are definites.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>But other than that, not really, Michelle.</p>
<p>Yeah, not too much, right?</p>
<p>Today, we're going to answer a listener question that I'm really excited about.</p>
<p>We've been getting so many good listener questions.</p>
<p>I absolutely love these.</p>
<p>So and today is no different.</p>
<p>Lindsay, this question comes to us from YouTube.</p>
<p>Would you like to read it?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is a question from Omid Zakari.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>question from omidzakari7393, and Omid is a long-time listener, Michelle.</p>
<p>I am excited to read this question.</p>
<p>Thanks so much, Lindsay and Aubrey.</p>
<p>I've been listening to your podcast for nine years.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, Michelle.</p>
<p>That's such a long time.</p>
<p>We love this listener.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>I have a question for you.</p>
<p>Could you please tell me about this phrase, it's a matter of when, not if.</p>
<p>In which situations can we use this?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance, Omid from Iran.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>Long-time listener.</p>
<p>Yeah, And Omid put a lot of hearts and smiley faces, so we appreciate that.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Yeah, we really appreciate that.</p>
<p>So just like Omid, I'm sure that Omid is following All Ears English and Apple Podcasts or Spotify or wherever.</p>
<p>Maybe he's a YouTube listener, watcher, because he asked this question.</p>
<p>Anyways, hit follow, hit subscribe, or follow wherever you are listening to the podcast.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>So yeah, great question.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when we say, it's a matter of when, not if?</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>What does it mean when we say it's a matter of when, not if?</p>
<p>Mm, yeah, so that's a good question.</p>
<p>So it just means that things are gonna happen eventually.</p>
<p>It's not, it's just, you can be sure that the thing is gonna happen.</p>
<p>It's just a matter of we're not sure the timing of the thing, right?</p>
<p>Right, right, right, exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, something's definitely gonna happen, not, and no ifs needed, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, the key is that we just don't know when.</p>
<p>So when would this be used?</p>
<p>Well, hypothetical situations would be a good one.</p>
<p>So when one person is positive about something and the other person is less sure, right?</p>
<p>So what does that look like, Michelle, in an example?</p>
<p>Right, so just talking about plans even, you know, just like, so maybe you're trying to get into a tough restaurant that's very popular.</p>
<p>You might say, oh, we will get into the restaurant.</p>
<p>It's a matter of when and not if.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>matter of when, not if.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, perfect.</p>
<p>Love that.</p>
<p>Um, yeah, no, that's good.</p>
<p>So what else?</p>
<p>What else?</p>
<p>Um, well, yeah, these hypothetical situations, Lindsay, you were, you were mentioning.</p>
<p>Um, so it could be the company will start to unravel if we don't do something now.</p>
<p>It's a matter of when, not if.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, And then when we're talking about goals, this is a very different orientation to it, to this phrase, right?</p>
<p>It's more of a positive orientation.</p>
<p>So if you are determined to build more muscle, for example, I'm going to build more muscle.</p>
<p>It's a matter of when, not if.</p>
<p>I can see like a teenager saying this to his mom, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>He's like, I'm gonna become buff, you know?</p>
<p>Right, right, right, right.</p>
<p>Just watch me.</p>
<p>I'm going to the gym for 10 hours on end.</p>
<p>You can't stop me.</p>
<p>It's a matter of when, right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Um, to me, I, I really like this.</p>
<p>It's quite confident sounding.</p>
<p>Lindsay, would you, would you use this?</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>Lindsey, would you use this?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think this is kind of in line with my philosophy in life of everything changes.</p>
<p>Even though sometimes we don't notice it, but everything will change eventually, right?</p>
<p>Changes are normal.</p>
<p>So when we see a big change coming, instead of getting scared and curling up and being afraid, we can see, hey, this was always coming.</p>
<p>And it's just happening now instead of at another time, right?</p>
<p>And so now I'm going to face the challenge and rise to the occasion.</p>
<p>It's quite empowering, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, I like that a lot.</p>
<p>Yeah, again, it depends how confident that you want to sound, right?</p>
<p>If you're very confident something is going to happen, you just don't know when, give this a try.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Okay, Michelle, where else should we go with this?</p>
<p>So would you say this has more of a positive, like, is it used more for positive or negative situations?</p>
<p>I think it's just, hmm, positive or negative.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to answer that.</p>
<p>I think both.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>I'm not sure how to answer that.</p>
<p>I think both actually.</p>
<p>I think both too.</p>
<p>And I also think that it can be great for business.</p>
<p>So I mean, you know, when somebody is searching for a job, you know, oh, she's going to get a job.</p>
<p>It's a matter of when, not if, you know?</p>
<p>So it could be used to encourage somebody.</p>
<p>So that's a positive thing.</p>
<p>But what's another example?</p>
<p>Okay, here's another example.</p>
<p>He's going to catch a cold if he doesn't get more sleep and practice proper hand hygiene.</p>
<p>It's a matter of when, not if.</p>
<p>That's probably true when you have kids and they're going to daycare and the parents are going to get sick.</p>
<p>It's a matter of when, not if, right?</p>
<p>Yes, I could see parents bonding over this.</p>
<p>It's like, oh, you know, oh, it's a matter of when, not if.</p>
<p>We all know that we're going to get the, well, that's, you know, if one kid is sick in the family and then, you know, it's going to rip through the household.</p>
<p>The whole house is going to rip.</p>
<p>It's a matter of when, not if.</p>
<p>When, not if.</p>
<p>And by the way, that's a great.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>When not in, and by the way, that's a great bonus for our listeners today, Michelle, rip through, rip through the household.</p>
<p>This actually, this phrase was used during the pandemic too.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, pandemic ripped through certain cities and towns and countries.</p>
<p>Um, but yeah, for us sicknesses within the household, just the common cold, we might say that too.</p>
<p>Yeah, Right, Yeah, Actually my, um, it's so funny because then you don't know where it started or where it ended.</p>
<p>My husband and my two kids now are, they all have colds and I don't really, but I kind of had something a couple like before them.</p>
<p>So I don't know, you know, it's, I don't know.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Either I gave it to them or that was something else, you know, they all start to overlap, but yeah, you never know.</p>
<p>You never know exactly.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, this is good for connection I think, because, um, it just, it, it like, I mean, like the sickness example, this is something.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>sickness example.</p>
<p>This is something that can help you bond with people over shared experiences and it can also just give you this sound of confidence.</p>
<p>What do you think, Lindsay?</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, I really think it can be a great phrase to encourage someone.</p>
<p>I liked your example of getting a job, you know.</p>
<p>Maybe if you don't have a job at the moment, you're going to get a job.</p>
<p>It's just a matter of when, not if.</p>
<p>If you have a friend that's in a not a great situation and they're worried about maybe, you know, their prospects getting a job or other scenarios, you could use this to encourage them.</p>
<p>I love that idea.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So let's talk about some similar ways to express this idea.</p>
<p>These are good ones.</p>
<p>So the first one is it's only a matter of time.</p>
<p>What do you think about that one?</p>
<p>Yeah, I love that.</p>
<p>Well, I'm sure people had to say this to themselves.</p>
<p>It's been hard shopping for homes, especially during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Things got really competitive, you know.</p>
<p>And so going back out there Saturday after Saturday, you had to say something, you know, to yourself.</p>
<p>So</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>thing, you know, to yourself.</p>
<p>So, for example, yeah, again, we'll find the house of our dreams.</p>
<p>It's only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>And this also makes me think of another expression, it only takes one.</p>
<p>Do you ever hear that?</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, So, these could be used for the house or the job or if somebody wants to meet someone sometimes we could do a whole episode on this and I might say, oh, it only takes one, right?</p>
<p>That's the example I was going to think of, you know, if your friend's really struggling with the dating world and they're really discouraged.</p>
<p>Dating is hard these days, you know, and to be able to say something, you know, it's hard to know what to say to people.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So, and then another thing you could say is, no question.</p>
<p>That's just a very confident sounding thing to say.</p>
<p>You could say, with a little bit of hard work, we will ace this.</p>
<p>No question.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So, I don't have any others to add there.</p>
<p>I think those are great.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>there.</p>
<p>I think those are great.</p>
<p>These are true connection skills.</p>
<p>100%. Yes, Yes, All right.</p>
<p>Let's put them together in a role play.</p>
<p>Let's do it, Michelle.</p>
<p>So here we are planning a party and we are friends.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So if the band shows up, we will be in great shape.</p>
<p>Oh, they will show up.</p>
<p>It's a matter of when, not if.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>And the food?</p>
<p>Oh, that's all squared away.</p>
<p>No question.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Do we have all the RSVPs?</p>
<p>Well, not yet, but the deadline is tomorrow.</p>
<p>So it's only a matter of time.</p>
<p>I'm feeling very confident about this.</p>
<p>Yes, Yes, You are very confident.</p>
<p>This is going to be a good one.</p>
<p>Maybe you have some party planning experience.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm sure.</p>
<p>I'm sure.</p>
<p>Imagine being a wedding planner and, you know, I guess you would have to be that confident about all the logistics if you're a wedding planner, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, Oh, gosh.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yep.</p>
<p>So here we are.</p>
<p>You said, oh, they will show up.</p>
<p>It's a matter of when, not if.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>of when, not if.</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>So I'm not, you're not quite so sure, right?</p>
<p>But I'm sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, And I can put you at ease.</p>
<p>Right, And you're echoing me because I said, oh, if the band shows up, we'll be in great shape.</p>
<p>So you were saying, so you're kind of echoing them.</p>
<p>So this can be a good one, guys, if you're listening to someone talk and they're saying, oh, if this happens, if that happens, and you kind of want to say, oh, it's going to happen.</p>
<p>This is also about, you know, I know someone who likes to talk a lot about like manifesting what's going to happen by putting positive feelings and phrases out into the world and just being positive.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>And I like that you highlighted that I am mirroring what you're saying.</p>
<p>So again, if the band shows up and I catch on to the if and I say it's a matter of when not if.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>And then I said, and the food and you said that's all squared away, which is a bonus for today.</p>
<p>What does that mean if something's all squared away?</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>something's all squared away.</p>
<p>It's all taken care of.</p>
<p>Yes, it's all done.</p>
<p>And then you said, no question.</p>
<p>Yes, I'm very confident.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then you said, okay, do we have all the RSVPs?</p>
<p>And I said, not yet, but the deadline's tomorrow.</p>
<p>So it's only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Clearly, Michelle, I have some party planning experience here, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I'm not a newbie.</p>
<p>No, not a newbie.</p>
<p>So, but yeah, let's, so you can use all of these.</p>
<p>These are all very common.</p>
<p>And Lindsay, another, since we were talking about kids today and colds and all that stuff, we have episode 2331 was a conversation starter.</p>
<p>How are kids seen around the world?</p>
<p>That was a fun one.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>That is a good recommendation.</p>
<p>So go back to 2331 and check that one out.</p>
<p>Michelle, I think the takeaway here today is this, it matters.</p>
<p>It kind of matters what you say when someone comes to you and they're not sure about something.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And if you feel like.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, And if you feel like you can, you know, you can get behind some positive message, if you do believe that this thing is going to happen for them, you can express that and help them to deal with the kind of challenges in life.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, This can really help you connect with someone who's feeling a little unsure of something.</p>
<p>So yeah, this was a great question from Omid.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>And yeah, Lindsay, I guess I'll talk to you on the next one.</p>
