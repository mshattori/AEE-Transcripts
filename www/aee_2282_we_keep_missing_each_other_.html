<p id="p-15">Yes, I am excited to record with you.</p>
<p id="p-16">You were away on a trip and yeah, so you had a good time? Yeah, it was in Slovenia.</p>
<p id="p-17">I'm sure it'll come up at some point in our episodes here, but good food, nice people, good hiking, beautiful nature.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-18">good hiking, beautiful nature, fantastic country.</p>
<p id="p-19">Yes, that's great.</p>
<p id="p-20">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-21">Have you ever tried to get in touch with someone, but you were like two ships passing in the night? Yes, completely.</p>
<p id="p-22">It's happened before.</p>
<p id="p-23">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-24">You know how sometimes we have memories that are linked to when someone said something to us.</p>
<p id="p-25">I have a distinct memory of a friend, a British friend who I met when I was in Paris, living in Paris.</p>
<p id="p-26">And we kept trying to get in touch to have a like a wine date or a coffee date.</p>
<p id="p-27">And he kept saying, oh, we're two ships in the night.</p>
<p id="p-28">Right, We just can't seem to arrange a time to meet.</p>
<p id="p-29">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-30">Yes, OK, so you remember that.</p>
<p id="p-31">So, yeah, I remember that.</p>
<p id="p-32">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-33">We're going to be talking about this expression today because I've been I hear it a lot.</p>
<p id="p-34">It always I I think I say it a lot.</p>
<p id="p-35">Do you? OK, Do you think it happened to you a lot that you miss your friends? Like you don't connect quite.</p>
<p id="p-36">You have the time.</p>
<p id="p-37">The timing doesn't line up with.</p>
<p id="p-38">Right, So sometimes it can be if even I'm going to pick up my kid, my my daughter.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-39">Kid my my daughter from school and you know, I might I might see someone but we never actually get to talk Yes, they're going in and I'm coming out and then you might just say oh, we're like two ships passing in the night So we're gonna talk about this today, but Lindsay we wanted to Thank our reviewers today.</p>
<p id="p-40">Oh my gosh We want to call out guys whenever you leave a rating or review for the podcast.</p>
<p id="p-41">We try to call out your name All right, so a big thank you to my John man from Japan and to Leo Manu Bella Afa Vinha from Brazil and Leo left us a five-star review Michelle and he says I'd like to show my gratitude in capital letters and respect in capital letters For the excellent job you're doing throughout so many years and let you know how inspiring you've been for so many people It's amazing to hear these reviews guys But you don't need to write a super long letter if you don't want to just go over and let us know what you think</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-42">just go over and let us know what you think about the show, or you could leave your episode topic request in your review, right, Michelle? Absolutely, yes, please.</p>
<p id="p-43">I love getting a good episode question, right? So a question to plan an episode, I get excited, I have to do a little research sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-44">Guys, the more specific your question, the better, and feel free to leave it in that review.</p>
<p id="p-45">But I just wanted to say thank you so much for that beautiful review, and to everyone else who's reviewed us, we really do appreciate it.</p>
<p id="p-46">Yeah, thanks guys.</p>
<p id="p-47">All right, Michelle, let's move on.</p>
<p id="p-48">So what does it mean? What exactly does this mean? Yes, So it basically means that people don't frequently see each other, but are likely in the same place just at different times.</p>
<p id="p-49">They just can't connect really physically in the same space.</p>
<p id="p-50">Yeah, totally, 100%.</p>
<p id="p-51">And I've seen it being said in a few ways, we're like two ships.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-52">said in a few ways, we're like two ships passing in the night, or we're like two ships in the night.</p>
<p id="p-53">I've heard in the night dropping the passing.</p>
<p id="p-54">Have you heard that before? Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-55">I have heard that.</p>
<p id="p-56">So there's some variations.</p>
<p id="p-57">You can drop the passing or sometimes you might just say, oh, we're like two ships, right? We've talked about this before, how sometimes with idioms, we will shorten them.</p>
<p id="p-58">And it's because they're so common that people know the end.</p>
<p id="p-59">So if you're lazy, you don't want to say the whole thing.</p>
<p id="p-60">I've heard that a lot.</p>
<p id="p-61">And that said, you know what that means.</p>
<p id="p-62">We have that shared understanding and this is really going to help you guys connect, understanding these expressions and how to shorten them.</p>
<p id="p-63">All right.</p>
<p id="p-64">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-65">So this makes me think of when I worked, you know, how I worked at a sports bar at a restaurant with a waitress and I worked nights and I would get off of work at maybe one or two in the morning.</p>
<p id="p-66">And my parents, I was still living with my parents at the time.</p>
<p id="p-67">And they would be pretty much, I would get home and</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-68">me pretty much I would get home and they would pretty much leave for work because I would go out with friends afterwards.</p>
<p id="p-69">And so we would rarely cross paths, which is another way to say we would rarely actually see each other.</p>
<p id="p-70">So I could have said, oh, we were like two ships passing in the night.</p>
<p id="p-71">Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-72">Even if we didn't really see each other or even if we did, it might be I'm coming in, they're going out.</p>
<p id="p-73">That makes total sense.</p>
<p id="p-74">That's a common use of this when you're sharing a home with someone or you imagine when you lived in New York in your 20s, maybe you had this or 20s or 30s, maybe it was roommates or like two ships.</p>
<p id="p-75">And again, it could just could be your two parents and you doesn't have to be one to one, right? Because your two parents are considered one ship.</p>
<p id="p-76">Right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-77">You don't have to actually worry.</p>
<p id="p-78">Like there's no three ships passing No, no, no, no.</p>
<p id="p-79">You don't have to equate it to how many people are like ships in the night.</p>
<p id="p-80">Yeah, we live busy lives.</p>
<p id="p-81">Right, you could say we're ships in the night.</p>
<p id="p-82">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-83">It was ships in the night.</p>
<p id="p-84">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-85">And what's interesting is I I don't know that this is often said on the phone I think it's more in a Physical space when you're not with someone or if you're with them and talking about how you don't frequently see each other I suppose you could use it over the phone But to me, it's more you say it when you are quickly passing someone Or right if you can't stop if you don't have the time or me Or when finally you have made the time and you're acknowledging that it's been quite hard to make that time to get together, right? Right, Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-86">So you could say it Not about a physical space, but I think it's more common in that way So let's talk about some other times this may happen or this expression may be used.</p>
<p id="p-87">What do you think Lindsay? Yeah, I think definitely at work is a good one Especially nowadays now that a lot of people are doing a hybrid model, right? Some people are working from home two days a week in the office three or three and two</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-88">week in the office three or three and two.</p>
<p id="p-89">And so not the weird thing about that is not everyone's in the office on the same days in some cases.</p>
<p id="p-90">So that would be the perfect example of where like ships in the night you're working from home when I'm in the office and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-91">Yeah, right.</p>
<p id="p-92">So I mean, you could say it like I like I said, you could say it maybe over or over zoom you could but to me it would feel more natural maybe.</p>
<p id="p-93">Oh, you run into each other or you talk to each other and you could say oh wow, you were there on Thursday I was there on Friday.</p>
<p id="p-94">Gee, we're like two ships passing in the night right when we get kind of just barely miss each other.</p>
<p id="p-95">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-96">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-97">Or I could see if someone does a lot of business travel and their partner also does a lot of business travel, crossing the globe crossing the country, you know, layovers and we just never come together, right that there are couples, you know, power couples that where you see that, right? Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p id="p-98">Or friends in the same</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-99">Or friends in the same neighborhood, you know, maybe you live nearby them like you were saying about roommates I mean, yeah, I never I never see you anymore I'm in the grocery store every Tuesday, but I think we are just two ships passing in the night.</p>
<p id="p-100">Yeah, those are good examples So it's people that maybe in the past you have spent more time together Maybe right or you would like you're kind of expressing that you would like to see that person more often You would like it to be easier to connect with that person, right? Yes exactly All right, Michelle So is there anyone that you could use this expression about anyone specific in your life right now? What'd you say? Oh Actually, I have one question.</p>
<p id="p-101">Do you would you use this for so we mentioned we don't use it on the telephone But if we're trying to arrange a phone date with someone or a phone chat when I say date I mean that broadly like a chat you catch up with a friend Yeah, does that also qualify for this or is it just that we can't physically be in the same space? You know</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-102">Physically be in the same space, you know, I said physically but now I'm starting to second yeah, I think that you know, it is really okay because it's really I Think that's for physical those like when you kind of bump into each other However, if you're trying to get in touch with someone so another expression would be phone tag, right? Right? We're playing phone tag Yes, right.</p>
<p id="p-103">So That that's a good one guys That'll be on our app as one of the vocabulary words on our personalized power list Go to all ears English comm slash app to get that.</p>
<p id="p-104">But yeah, like you could use it if you're playing phone tech so I'll give you an example Aubrey and I we were trying to get in touch with each other because we have we're planning an upcoming series together and we we wanted to I'm I Especially with business sometimes it's easier for me to talk to someone on the phone and especially for planning a series I like that sense makes it right.</p>
<p id="p-105">So</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-106">Makes sense.</p>
<p id="p-107">Right, So, but we were like two ships.</p>
<p id="p-108">I mean, we were just playing phone tag and eventually we just went to email and then we came up with our ideas over email and then we did talk through them over the phone.</p>
<p id="p-109">But I could have said to Aubrey, oh my gosh, we're like two ships.</p>
<p id="p-110">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-111">It wasn't working out.</p>
<p id="p-112">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-113">No, that makes total sense.</p>
<p id="p-114">That's a good example.</p>
<p id="p-115">And I like how you use the shortened version there.</p>
<p id="p-116">We're like two ships or we were, we have been, we've been like, I guess you could say that we've been like two ships in the night, but you can get away with that.</p>
<p id="p-117">Right, Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-118">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-119">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-120">I mean, I think the whole thing is it's, it's kind of spontaneous in the moment.</p>
<p id="p-121">It's, it's a little bit humorous.</p>
<p id="p-122">Don't you think? It's like, oh, we're like two ships.</p>
<p id="p-123">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-124">For sure.</p>
<p id="p-125">Because if you think of large shipping ships, I guess, just kind of not seeing each other, but quietly passing.</p>
<p id="p-126">Right, Right, Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-127">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-128">So, uh, her name is Jen and she's now moved down to new Orleans.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-129">She's now moved down to New Orleans, but yeah, we never, it's really hard to arrange.</p>
<p id="p-130">She has two kids, she's busy.</p>
<p id="p-131">I'm busy with my life and it's just, it's hard to arrange that phone conversation.</p>
<p id="p-132">So we can go for like three months trying to arrange something.</p>
<p id="p-133">I know, and especially the more time that goes on, the harder it is because you know there's more to catch up on.</p>
<p id="p-134">I mean, Lindsay, well, yeah, are you a phone talker or are you more of a texter? I'm more of a, I think I'm really a Gen X-er.</p>
<p id="p-135">I think like at heart, I'm a Gen X-er.</p>
<p id="p-136">So I'm a talker, not as much a texter.</p>
<p id="p-137">Yeah, but sometimes I will resort to text if I just, we can't get the time to get on a call.</p>
<p id="p-138">What about you, Michelle? Are you more of a texter or a talker? You know, I used to talk on the phone.</p>
<p id="p-139">I mean, I remember being in school and just talking with my best friend for hours on the phone.</p>
<p id="p-140">I mean, that was so exciting, right? In high school and middle school, oh, a phone call, and then you just.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-141">Oh, a phone call.</p>
<p id="p-142">And then you just thought so.</p>
<p id="p-143">But I will say now I think I mostly just talk to my sometimes I talk to my cousin.</p>
<p id="p-144">I talk to my I talk to my mom a hundred times a day.</p>
<p id="p-145">And I would say I'm more of a texter now.</p>
<p id="p-146">And it too.</p>
<p id="p-147">But I do like to talk on the phone.</p>
<p id="p-148">But it's nice.</p>
<p id="p-149">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-150">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-151">I mean, if you're busy, the good thing about texting is that you don't have to respond right away, which you lose a little bit of the connection sometimes I think, but it is more convenient and you can be talking to more people in any given day and staying connected with more.</p>
<p id="p-152">I've always thought that the funny thing about texting is I feel like conversations never have a formal ending.</p>
<p id="p-153">It's just one long string of conversation.</p>
<p id="p-154">You know, you're just talking to somebody and then they say something and the conversation just trails off.</p>
<p id="p-155">There's no formal.</p>
<p id="p-156">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-157">Good night.</p>
<p id="p-158">A hundred percent.</p>
<p id="p-159">I think I was kind of, we could do another episode on this, but I think I didn't totally understand that.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-160">of this.</p>
<p id="p-161">I think I didn't totally understand that when I started when texting became mainstream.</p>
<p id="p-162">And I have a friend who that's like, it's extreme that way.</p>
<p id="p-163">You just never know when it's going to end.</p>
<p id="p-164">It doesn't continue.</p>
<p id="p-165">So it has ended.</p>
<p id="p-166">Usually I kind of do try to wrap things up a little bit subtly.</p>
<p id="p-167">I think this could be a great episode.</p>
<p id="p-168">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-169">How do you wrap up a text message? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-170">Without being without being too old fashioned in the sense of, okay, we'll have a nice day, right? It's a little too old fashioned.</p>
<p id="p-171">You know what? We should both go into our own text messages and like research.</p>
<p id="p-172">How do we do a little bit of a case study? I love that idea.</p>
<p id="p-173">Guys hit that follow button.</p>
<p id="p-174">And also Michelle mentioned, we're going to be doing a series on politics this fall.</p>
<p id="p-175">If it was ever needed, it's now, right? It's going to be a big season here.</p>
<p id="p-176">So tune in, hit follow, make sure you don't miss a single episode of All Ears English to get that series on politics.</p>
<p id="p-177">All right.</p>
<p id="p-178">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-179">All right.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-180">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-181">All right.</p>
<p id="p-182">So anyway, back, back to this topic.</p>
<p id="p-183">So other things that you could say briefly, I mean, you could say rarely or hardly, like, yeah, we hardly ever see each other.</p>
<p id="p-184">We rarely ever see each other.</p>
<p id="p-185">So you could say, I'm always in your neighborhood, but we rarely see each other.</p>
<p id="p-186">That one's totally self explanatory.</p>
<p id="p-187">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-188">Or we keep missing each other.</p>
<p id="p-189">Now this is interesting.</p>
<p id="p-190">This is not saying I miss you so much, but you kind of do a little bit, but it doesn't to miss someone is to not intersect with them.</p>
<p id="p-191">In this case, it's a different use of that verb.</p>
<p id="p-192">Yeah, right.</p>
<p id="p-193">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-194">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-195">So what, how would we use that? We could say, I'd love to get dinner, but we're never in the same place at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-196">We keep missing each other.</p>
<p id="p-197">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-198">Yes, Yes, Or you could say, I never see you just, I never see you.</p>
<p id="p-199">We're both so busy.</p>
<p id="p-200">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-201">And that's just a little more just upfront and straightforward.</p>
<p id="p-202">Right? I never see you.</p>
<p id="p-203">Right, We're both</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-204">I never see you, right? We're both so busy.</p>
<p id="p-205">Let's go into a roleplay Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-206">Shall we? Okay All right guys and stay tuned because we are going to be doing a Spotify poll At the end of this episode after the roleplay.</p>
<p id="p-207">Okay, cool So, okay in this roleplay We are teachers in the same school.</p>
<p id="p-208">All right, here we go Okay, which period do you have your break third period Oh Minus fourth.</p>
<p id="p-209">I never see you now.</p>
<p id="p-210">I know why I know we're like two ships passing in the night Exactly, and we keep missing each other at staff meetings.</p>
<p id="p-211">I know it's so sad that we hardly ever see each other Yeah, yeah Did you ever have this experience to where there's someone that you know that you would get along well with you just feel there's chemistry There but you haven't quite gotten into a connection yet And you might use this in that case to where you're thinking like we both know we could become friends But it's a shame that we</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-212">But it's a shame that we are, you know, we're two ships in the night.</p>
<p id="p-213">This might be another scenario.</p>
<p id="p-214">So it's not just for people that you know well and want to get together with.</p>
<p id="p-215">It could be expressing that you actually would like to get to know someone.</p>
<p id="p-216">Right? Right, Right, Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-217">That's true.</p>
<p id="p-218">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-219">All right.</p>
<p id="p-220">Let's, let's go through this.</p>
<p id="p-221">So what did I say first? All right.</p>
<p id="p-222">So you said, Oh, mine is fourth period.</p>
<p id="p-223">You asked what period of break.</p>
<p id="p-224">And then you said, I never see you.</p>
<p id="p-225">And now I know why.</p>
<p id="p-226">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-227">And then you said, I know we're like two ships passing in the night.</p>
<p id="p-228">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-229">And then you said, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-230">And we keep missing each other at staff meetings.</p>
<p id="p-231">So we're not even able to connect.</p>
<p id="p-232">Maybe you end up being on one end of the room at a staff meeting and I'm on the other end.</p>
<p id="p-233">And then you have to run out of the room.</p>
<p id="p-234">It's just not working out.</p>
<p id="p-235">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-236">Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-237">And then you said, I know it's so sad that we hardly ever see each other.</p>
<p id="p-238">Yes, Right, </p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p id="p-239">Yes, right.</p>
<p id="p-240">We have one episode to send you guys back to, to discover more of All Ears English.</p>
<p id="p-241">And that episode is Nasty vs.</p>
<p id="p-242">Mean in English.</p>
<p id="p-243">So scroll back in our catalog and check that out.</p>
<p id="p-244">Is that one connected to today's episode, Michelle? This is just a fun one to throw in, actually.</p>
<p id="p-245">Yeah, I like it.</p>
<p id="p-246">Well, it's a good one.</p>
<p id="p-247">I wonder what the difference is, right? It's certainly a higher level episode to know the difference between those two words.</p>
<p id="p-248">Yeah? Yes, Good.</p>
<p id="p-249">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-250">So let's get to our poll.</p>
<p id="p-251">So we were talking about if we still actually talk on the phone.</p>
<p id="p-252">So we're talking, we're not talking about maybe calling someone because you just need something quick.</p>
<p id="p-253">We're talking more about those catch up calls, right? Catch up calls.</p>
<p id="p-254">So yeah, actually, that's a good thing to call it.</p>
<p id="p-255">Do you still, the poll today is do you still have catch up conversations, we'll call them, with people on the phone? And the options are yes, all the time.</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p id="p-256">are, yes, all the time, no, I'm a texter, or sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-257">Yeah, I hope it's not going away, right? I would be a sometimes on that, because not all the time, but sometimes, and I'm certainly not a texter, as we said, but I'm excited to see what the results are here, Michelle, and we will announce them coming up soon.</p>
<p id="p-258">You gotta be on Spotify to participate in this poll, right? Absolutely, all right, Lindsey, so what do you think the takeaway is of today? This is a good way to show someone that you actually want to connect with them, right? We're all about connection, human connection, here at All Ears English, and this is what you say when it's just not happening, and you want the person to know you want it to happen.</p>
<p id="p-259">There's a lot of intention behind this phrase, okay? Yes, yes, yes, exactly, and it's said in kind of a fun, oop, we're like two ships, right? Not too heavy, right, it's not too heavy, it's not, oh my God, I really wanna see you, no, that's too serious, okay? Exactly, this is just, it's.</p>
<h2>Part-21</h2>
<p id="p-260">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-261">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-262">This is just, it's kind of a cute, fun way to acknowledge that you just, oh, it's not, it's just not working out.</p>
<p id="p-263">You got it.</p>
<p id="p-264">I'd love to talk to you.</p>
<p id="p-265">Yeah, guys.</p>
<p id="p-266">So, deploy this phrase, make use of it, let us know how it goes.</p>
