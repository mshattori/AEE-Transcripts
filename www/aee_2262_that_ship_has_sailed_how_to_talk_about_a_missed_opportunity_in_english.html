<p id="p-8">Hey, Michelle, I've got a question for you today.</p>
<p id="p-9">Oh, ok.</p>
<p id="p-10">I'm excited to hear it.</p>
<p id="p-11">What is that right? Diving right into it? Have you ever been sailing maybe on the open ocean or even just on a river or anywhere? Yes, I have.</p>
<p id="p-12">I did go sailing, um, for actually something with one of my first jobs.</p>
<p id="p-13">We were doing a little story about sailing and I got to go in the Hudson River.</p>
<p id="p-14">Oh, very nice.</p>
<p id="p-15">Very nice.</p>
<p id="p-16">You don't care that place of legends.</p>
<p id="p-17">Right, Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-18">What about you? Yeah, I'm actually going sailing this Saturday with my, in Boston.</p>
<p id="p-19">Yeah, I'm going to Boston taking a red eye and flying in to see them going to be out there on the east coast for the next week or so.</p>
<p id="p-20">So we have booked a sale like an afternoon sale on the Charles, which is equally the stuff of legends.</p>
<p id="p-21">Michelle in terms of these city rivers are yes, Hudson, the Charles river legendary for, you know, the history of these cities.</p>
<p id="p-22">Just crazy stuff.</p>
<p id="p-23">But anyway, sailing is, yeah, I think it'll be fun.</p>
<p id="p-24">I hope so.</p>
<p id="p-25">Yeah, that's great.</p>
<p id="p-26">That's great.</p>
<p id="p-27">So today we're actually going to talk about a very useful and common expression that deals with sailing.</p>
<p id="p-28">Um So, but before we get into that guys, check out, we just did episode 2255.</p>
<p id="p-29">Was it gets me every time how to say what makes you emotional in English.</p>
<p id="p-30">So maybe sailing, maybe we have some sailors listening to this podcast.</p>
<p id="p-31">And I can imagine that if you sailing is really your thing and you see a really beautiful, you see some really beautiful scenery that you can get a little emotional.</p>
<p id="p-32">I actually have a couple of friends who, when they were in their twenties they sailed around the, I don't know if it was around the world or they sailed, I think, from the east coast to the Mediterranean Sea and just like, spent like a year on a sailboat just going all around.</p>
<p id="p-33">Wow.</p>
<p id="p-34">I would love to hear about that.</p>
<p id="p-35">That's what was crazy.</p>
<p id="p-36">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-37">Really crazy.</p>
<p id="p-38">So, anyway, guys, hit, follow on this podcast right now, hit that follow button.</p>
<p id="p-39">So you don't miss a single episode that we publish here.</p>
<p id="p-40">All right.</p>
<p id="p-41">So let's talk about that expression again.</p>
<p id="p-42">So what is it? It is that ship has sailed Lindsay? Do you use this? Yeah, I am noticing too Michelle, as you said, this is becoming more and more common and we love to bring our listeners here at all.</p>
<p id="p-43">English, the most common language that is trending now and this is one of one of these vocabulary expressions.</p>
<p id="p-44">It really is.</p>
<p id="p-45">And I was saying to Lindsay, you know, I heard it once and I, I mean, it's been around forever.</p>
<p id="p-46">I don't remember a time where this expression didn't exist.</p>
<p id="p-47">But for some reason, I've been noticing that I hearing it more.</p>
<p id="p-48">So I'm not sure why, but very interesting.</p>
<p id="p-49">Um But Lindsay, is this actually about ships or sailing? No, we're not talking about that at all.</p>
<p id="p-50">Right, And actually you probably don't even use this when you're on the water, right? You're not gonna, well, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-51">If you, you're on the ship, I mean, maybe if you sail outdoor sailboat, you might say, oh, that ship has sailed, but haven't we started moving? It's obviously more literal.</p>
<p id="p-52">But where you're seeing people use it now in Native English is when something is over or there was a chance, there was a window.</p>
<p id="p-53">I like that expression.</p>
<p id="p-54">There was a window for something to happen and it's gone.</p>
<p id="p-55">It's no longer available.</p>
<p id="p-56">The thing can no longer happen.</p>
<p id="p-57">The chance is like you say, like there was a window, you could say a window of opportunity.</p>
<p id="p-58">So that's a good bonus for today.</p>
<p id="p-59">Great bonus.</p>
<p id="p-60">Yeah, and I like this because this is a really accurate, a very precise expression.</p>
<p id="p-61">We know exactly what you're saying when you use this.</p>
<p id="p-62">The right.</p>
<p id="p-63">Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-64">So, um, yeah, not but definitely not about ships.</p>
<p id="p-65">So let's do some examples.</p>
<p id="p-66">So the first one is, I thought it would be a great couple, but that ship has sailed.</p>
<p id="p-67">He has a new girlfriend.</p>
<p id="p-68">Uh So that opportunity, that window of opportunity our bonus word has, has ended, it's gone.</p>
<p id="p-69">He has moved on.</p>
<p id="p-70">Right, It's just not, not a thing that could happen now.</p>
<p id="p-71">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-72">Or I was hoping to get the job, but I called and unfortunately that ship has sailed.</p>
<p id="p-73">They already chose someone again.</p>
<p id="p-74">There was a window, there was a chance there was a moment that something could have happened, but it passed.</p>
<p id="p-75">Right, Right, This is, it's a missed opportunity.</p>
<p id="p-76">Um, Lindsay would, have you ever had a missed opportunity or had a door close or had a chance where you felt like that ship has sailed? Well, I kind of, so I spent a lot of my twenties, traveling, living abroad just really living that nomadic life a bit.</p>
<p id="p-77">And I kind of, now that I'm in my early forties I've kind of thought, did I miss my window to do that again? You know, what about to go to India and kind of wander India for a few months.</p>
<p id="p-78">Has that ship sailed for me? Right, That makes me feel sad.</p>
<p id="p-79">So then I move on to thinking about something else.</p>
<p id="p-80">That's funny.</p>
<p id="p-81">Um, yeah, I was having a hard time thinking of an example of this for myself.</p>
<p id="p-82">But when you started sharing your own, I mean, I could say the exact same thing about myself.</p>
<p id="p-83">You know, that once you get a little bit older and you get a little bit more rooted and your life, if you, if you don't have a certain type of lifestyle where you can just up and go easily.</p>
<p id="p-84">Yeah, it does feel like that a little bit.</p>
<p id="p-85">But then I always think maybe at some point later in my life, well, if you want it bad enough, right? If you want it badly enough, if anything is possible.</p>
<p id="p-86">But that's a good example.</p>
<p id="p-87">Maybe things that we thought we would do again.</p>
<p id="p-88">Or we thought we would do at some point.</p>
<p id="p-89">We never quite got to it.</p>
<p id="p-90">Um That's why I definitely recommend travel when you're young.</p>
<p id="p-91">You know, get that in when you're young because you never know what's going to happen.</p>
<p id="p-92">Right, Yeah, totally.</p>
<p id="p-93">And also setting up your life so that you have spent your younger years traveling, you're gaining all this wisdom, which, you know, then you go into your later life with that wisdom and that experience is pretty cool.</p>
<p id="p-94">So you feel a little more settled, a little more rooted right in your life moving forward, I think.</p>
<p id="p-95">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-96">Right, And you know, it's funny with this expression does, it, it doesn't have to be, we, we, it sounds like, oh, it's very profound and it has to be, you know, something thought provoking.</p>
<p id="p-97">It doesn't have to be about big profound situations.</p>
<p id="p-98">It can be about missing something small, for example, let's do this little role play.</p>
<p id="p-99">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-100">So should we go to the movie? Uh Oh, that ship has sailed.</p>
<p id="p-101">Uh Why? Uh the last showing started 10 minutes ago? Oh, no, we missed that movie.</p>
<p id="p-102">I would have been upset.</p>
<p id="p-103">I actually went to see the, the New Twister last weekend.</p>
<p id="p-104">How was it? It was good.</p>
<p id="p-105">Actually, at first I thought it was because she's just going to repeat the same template and I was going to be bored.</p>
<p id="p-106">But no, there's new elements.</p>
<p id="p-107">Um There's a lot more in to it.</p>
<p id="p-108">To the story than what the old one was.</p>
<p id="p-109">I think the old one is still kind of the best I think.</p>
<p id="p-110">But I would recommend the New Twisters.</p>
<p id="p-111">It's called Twisters.</p>
<p id="p-112">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-113">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-114">Well, good.</p>
<p id="p-115">Well, I saw Despicable Me Four.</p>
<p id="p-116">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-117">And what are your thoughts? Because I had, I, I have two small Children.</p>
<p id="p-118">Um, I, it's fine, it's fine.</p>
<p id="p-119">There are a lot of good people in it, like Steve Carell is in it and Will Ferrell but not my favorite movie.</p>
<p id="p-120">But yeah, there are movie reviews from All Es English.</p>
<p id="p-121">Love it, love it.</p>
<p id="p-122">You see, it can be about a big profound thing that you feel like you've missed or just something as simple as we physically can't get there because it's too late.</p>
<p id="p-123">Yeah, I love that idea.</p>
<p id="p-124">This expression is not just limited to big things or small things.</p>
<p id="p-125">It works for everything.</p>
<p id="p-126">It's just about you miss something, right? Yes, The best way to reach your goals is to follow a clear study plan step by step.</p>

<p id="p-131">All ears English dot com slash B one.</p>
<p id="p-132">That's letter B number one.</p>
<p id="p-133">All right.</p>
<p id="p-134">So Michelle, we hinted at a few other things that we could say, like window of opportunity.</p>
<p id="p-135">But what are some other things that would mean the same thing? So you could say too late or it's too late or it's too late now? Right, Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-136">So too late.</p>
<p id="p-137">Right, That's a common one.</p>
<p id="p-138">Right, Just hearing that being said.</p>
<p id="p-139">So, for example.</p>
<p id="p-140">Oh, no, I wanted to sign up but it's too late now.</p>
<p id="p-141">They're sold out.</p>
<p id="p-142">Yeah, that one's more common for sure.</p>
<p id="p-143">Right, Um, the next one is missed the boat.</p>
<p id="p-144">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-145">So this is, this could be a little bit different.</p>
<p id="p-146">We could do a whole episode on to miss the boat.</p>
<p id="p-147">We could do a whole episode about missing, uh, about sailing idioms.</p>
<p id="p-148">Right, There seems to be a lot of things with boats.</p>
<p id="p-149">Um, it's strange you could say I really missed the boat on that stock pick.</p>
<p id="p-150">Right, So, this might be more about a bigger thing to miss.</p>
<p id="p-151">Right, So, I, I, to miss the boat.</p>
<p id="p-152">Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-153">What do you think about this one? Yeah, I miss the boat.</p>
<p id="p-154">It also has a connotation that a lot of people got in the boat.</p>
<p id="p-155">A lot of people got in the boat.</p>
<p id="p-156">There was a boat, it was like a group thing, you know, like buying apple stock in, I don't know, right when it came back and started to just go through the roof.</p>
<p id="p-157">Any technology stock, right.</p>
<p id="p-158">Um, a lot of people got on board and people have done really well, I guess, I don't know, not making stock recommendations here, but that's a good example.</p>
<p id="p-159">I think investment opportunities, definitely people might feel they missed the boat.</p>
<p id="p-160">Right, Or, yeah, in real estate, when real estate could be another big one.</p>
<p id="p-161">I, uh, with real estate you feel like you're always on the really lucky end or? No, not so lucky.</p>
<p id="p-162">And there are people who sell and then they make so much money and then you just are not, you have to really be in the right place at the right time, right place at the right time.</p>
<p id="p-163">And once you realize what the right place was, it's no longer the right place like Denver had kind of had that moment and I think that's passed.</p>
<p id="p-164">I think that ship has sailed a little bit for Denver.</p>
<p id="p-165">It's just become very expensive here in general.</p>
<p id="p-166">You know, I heard that actually.</p>
<p id="p-167">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-168">Yeah, that ship has sailed.</p>
<p id="p-169">So, anyways moving on.</p>
<p id="p-170">So, what else, Michelle? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-171">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-172">I mean, this could be all useful for things, even just missing the train or the bus or missing a sail or missing out on a job.</p>
<p id="p-173">Right, So you missed the boat or you missed a party, right? That ship has sailed.</p>
<p id="p-174">I'm not, I, I'm not, I can't go anymore.</p>
<p id="p-175">So lot, lots of other things.</p>
<p id="p-176">I mean, I think just this missed opportunity is the biggest key thing to walk away with today and it can be hard if you feel like you've missed out on an opportunity that you can, you can't get back to.</p>
<p id="p-177">But it's kind of like what you said, Lindsay, you think about it and makes you a little sad, but then you just have to keep moving forward.</p>
<p id="p-178">It's kind of the feeling of trying not to have any regrets, right? Yeah, regret is the worst.</p>
<p id="p-179">But you don't want to miss the next thing, right? And so you just stay present and try to keep moving on.</p>
<p id="p-180">Don't spend too much time, sort of sitting in that sense of regret because that is the worst.</p>
<p id="p-181">Yes, Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-182">So we don't want you to regret missing any of our episodes.</p>
<p id="p-183">So, um that you hit the follow button, um, wherever you are listening to all English.</p>
<p id="p-184">So you never feel that sense of regret.</p>
<p id="p-185">You never miss the book 100% hit that follow button guys.</p>
<p id="p-186">Yeah, we're moving into September pretty soon here.</p>
<p id="p-187">This is the time to really set up a nice learning routine for yourself, especially lately, a lot of our listeners have and telling us we're coming along with you guys on your commute in the morning, walking your dog in the morning, we realize that, you know, the best way to learn is to bring English into what you're already doing and you can do that with a podcast so easily just having ear buds in the ears.</p>
<p id="p-188">So, should we do a role play? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-189">So, here we are two friends in the car.</p>
<p id="p-190">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-191">All right.</p>
<p id="p-192">I can't wait to get there.</p>
<p id="p-193">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-194">Help me get into the next lane.</p>
<p id="p-195">Uh, Michelle, that ship has sailed.</p>
<p id="p-196">You just missed the exit.</p>
<p id="p-197">Oh, man, I didn't hear the GPS.</p>
<p id="p-198">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-199">Well, it's too late now.</p>
<p id="p-200">We'll have to get off the highway.</p>
<p id="p-201">Oh, I really missed the boat on that one, didn't I? It's ok.</p>
<p id="p-202">We'll get there.</p>
<p id="p-203">You know, this scenario feels more like a web 1.0 moment before we had Google Maps, you know, before we had just, like, recalculate when we had the old school GPS.</p>
<p id="p-204">S or the, um, what do they call them garments or something? I think something like that or just maps.</p>
<p id="p-205">Yeah, I know I was talking about this with somebody just about how much I need the GPS.</p>
<p id="p-206">And, you know, actually I, I was driving somewhere and I always, after I drop my daughter off I have a, there's a dead zone so the GPS doesn't work for a little while.</p>
<p id="p-207">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-208">But, yeah, but if you have it preprogrammed it should, it should keep working.</p>
<p id="p-209">Right? Or you mean you can't program a new destination or it's just like I can totally, but then it just kind of, it there's really, no, I don't know the signal.</p>
<p id="p-210">There is not very good.</p>
<p id="p-211">So it's been a little bit of an issue.</p>
<p id="p-212">So today I needed to get to a doctor's appointment quickly.</p>
<p id="p-213">So I had the brilliant idea.</p>
<p id="p-214">I anticipated it.</p>
<p id="p-215">I, I, I wasn't gonna let that chip sail.</p>
<p id="p-216">I basically, uh, I looked it up and then I screenshotted the direction so I could do it old school.</p>
<p id="p-217">Like on map.</p>
<p id="p-218">Smart, smart.</p>
<p id="p-219">So, yeah, but then it worked.</p>
<p id="p-220">All right.</p>
<p id="p-221">Anyway, so let's go through this.</p>
<p id="p-222">Ok, cool.</p>
<p id="p-223">So, here, you know, we're trying to get to this, uh, where are we trying to go or maybe a concert or something? Some event.</p>
<p id="p-224">Right, Sure.</p>
<p id="p-225">Why not? Why not? And then I, so first I said, oh, Michelle, you.</p>
<p id="p-226">So you're saying, can you help me get in that lane? And I said, oh, Michelle, that ship has sailed, you just missed the exit.</p>
<p id="p-227">So I'm giving you a little bit of a hard time here.</p>
<p id="p-228">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-229">And then I said, I didn't hear the GPS and you said, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-230">Well, it's too late now.</p>
<p id="p-231">We'll have to get off the highway.</p>
<p id="p-232">Yeah, I'm being a little bitter here giving you a little bit of an attitude.</p>
<p id="p-233">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-234">Maybe you should drive next time.</p>
<p id="p-235">Lindsay, maybe.</p>
<p id="p-236">Right, Right, And then I'm a backseat driver.</p>
<p id="p-237">Right? So I love that.</p>
<p id="p-238">And then you said I really missed the boat on that one, didn't I? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-239">So, again, you missed the chance.</p>
<p id="p-240">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-241">All right.</p>
<p id="p-242">Good stuff, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-243">What's the takeaway for today on today's episode? Well, guys, I, to me the take way is that this is such a versatile expression.</p>
<p id="p-244">It can be for something as small as, you know, you already ordered your meal and you wanted to change the order, but it's already on its way out.</p>
<p id="p-245">I mean, something really just tiny, tiny like that or it can be about big things in your life, big decisions that you've made or things you wished you've done.</p>
<p id="p-246">Um But the important thing is to just keep moving forward.</p>
<p id="p-247">Um But now you have a really good connection expression to talk about this because everybody knows that feeling of the ship sail.</p>
<p id="p-248">Yeah, and it's also it goes beyond just your own life, right? We can talk about large geopolitical events, windows of opportunity, things that could have happened, that didn't happen, uh economic shifts, uh things like that so you can use this for bigger things or just things in your life.</p>
<p id="p-249">That's why I like it.</p>
<p id="p-250">Yeah, it's really, this is a source of connection in many ways.</p>
<p id="p-251">Definitely, it's very, very useful and now I bet that we've talked about it.</p>
<p id="p-252">You probably are going to start hearing it for sure, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-253">Alright, good stuff.</p>
<p id="p-254">Thanks for bringing this expression to the show Michelle and I'll see you next time.</p>
<p id="p-255">Thanks Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-256">Have a good one.</p>
