<p id="p-10">Hello, Lindsay, how are you today?</p>
<p id="p-11">Excellent, Aubrey, feeling great.</p>
<p id="p-12">Weekend is coming up.</p>
<p id="p-13">How about you?</p>
<p id="p-14">How's it going?</p>
<p id="p-15">Excellent.</p>
<p id="p-16">I have a question.</p>
<p id="p-17">I am curious.</p>
<p id="p-18">What were you doing right before we started recording?</p>
<p id="p-19">Ooh, right before we started recording, I was catching up on emails.</p>
<p id="p-20">It was 8.30 a.m. or 9.30 a.m. So starting my day.</p>
<p id="p-21">That makes sense.</p>
<p id="p-22">That's kind of a boring answer, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-23">Yeah, it's kind of boring.</p>
<p id="p-24">But you know what?</p>
<p id="p-25">A lot of you out there, that's probably what you were doing before you listened to this podcast, right?</p>
<p id="p-26">We're all responding to emails.</p>
<p id="p-27">So much of our day anymore.</p>
<p id="p-28">I know, it's amazing.</p>
<p id="p-29">It just takes over.</p>
<p id="p-30">You know, they just come in and they just never stop coming in.</p>
<p id="p-31">The never-ending list of emails to respond to.</p>
<p id="p-32">What about you, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-33">What were you doing before we started recording today?</p>
<p id="p-34">I did a Peloton ride right before we started recording.</p>
<p id="p-35">Yes! That was fun.</p>
<p id="p-36">Every now and then they have live rides and it's really fun to do it live with the instructor.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-37">Really fun to do it live with the instructor.</p>
<p id="p-38">Usually it's like a pre-recorded one.</p>
<p id="p-39">But when I can, I try to jump on and do the live ride.</p>
<p id="p-40">And how long was the ride?</p>
<p id="p-41">It was just a 15 minute ride.</p>
<p id="p-42">Sometimes they're quite a bit longer, but sometimes they're really short so you can squeeze them in.</p>
<p id="p-43">Yeah, fantastic.</p>
<p id="p-44">All right, good.</p>
<p id="p-45">What are we getting into today?</p>
<p id="p-46">Yeah, the reason I asked, you know, what were you doing before you started recording?</p>
<p id="p-47">We talked about this in part one of this series with past progressive.</p>
<p id="p-48">We often use it for interrupted actions.</p>
<p id="p-49">So this is part two of a series, but you can listen to this one first, stay to the end and we'll share what part one was.</p>
<p id="p-50">But these can be listened to out of order.</p>
<p id="p-51">Yes, guys, make sure you hit the follow button right here on All Ears English so you don't miss any of these series that we do or any of our episodes.</p>
<p id="p-52">We drop five days a week.</p>
<p id="p-53">All right.</p>
<p id="p-54">So we often get questions from students about past progressive versus past simple.</p>
<p id="p-55">How do I know whether to use that verb?</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-56">How do I know whether to use that verb ing or go with past simple?</p>
<p id="p-57">And today we're talking about the main time we use past progressive is for simultaneous and interrupted actions.</p>
<p id="p-58">So you use past progressive there because you were answering emails when you had to jump on this call to record podcasts.</p>
<p id="p-59">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-60">So we have an example here.</p>
<p id="p-61">Shall I go ahead with the example?</p>
<p id="p-62">Yeah, let's do it.</p>
<p id="p-63">While I was making dinner, I helped my daughter with her homework.</p>
<p id="p-64">So this is simultaneous actions, right?</p>
<p id="p-65">And mom often has to multitask as well as, you know, everybody really.</p>
<p id="p-66">But while you're doing one thing, you do something else.</p>
<p id="p-67">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-68">And here this is where we have past progressive while I was making dinner.</p>
<p id="p-69">And then the other action can be past simple if it's something that was completed at a specific moment in the past.</p>
<p id="p-70">Yes, it can be past simple as an option.</p>
<p id="p-71">It could also be past progressive too, right?</p>
<p id="p-72">While I was making dinner, I was helping my daughter with her homework.</p>
<p id="p-73">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-74">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-75">It depends on the action.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-76">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-77">It depends on the action and if you are referring to it as a specific point in time.</p>
<p id="p-78">That's why this is really tricky grammar.</p>
<p id="p-79">It's difficult to know sometimes which to choose.</p>
<p id="p-80">All right.</p>
<p id="p-81">What else do we have to know here, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-82">All right.</p>
<p id="p-83">So we're going to dive into the two times, right?</p>
<p id="p-84">Simultaneous actions, interrupted actions.</p>
<p id="p-85">So the first one, the normal construction is when I was doing something or while I was doing something, something else happened.</p>
<p id="p-86">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-87">So for example, when I was eating breakfast, I spilled my orange juice.</p>
<p id="p-88">Yeah, So the breakdown of grammar here, the first part of the sentence is an adverb clause describing this action and how it happened when it was interrupted.</p>
<p id="p-89">And the second part is an independent clause.</p>
<p id="p-90">This can stand alone as a sentence.</p>
<p id="p-91">So you have either while or when the subject and then past progressive.</p>
<p id="p-92">So that's was or were with verb ing.</p>
<p id="p-93">And then the next part of the sentence subject and then either a past simple verb or like you pointed out, Lindsay, depending on the</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-94">Or like you pointed out, Lindsay, depending on the sentence, the past progressive again.</p>
<p id="p-95">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-96">All right.</p>
<p id="p-97">And thinking about that construction there, here's another example.</p>
<p id="p-98">While I was fixing the car, she handed me tools and kept me company.</p>
<p id="p-99">Yeah, Yeah, And this is kind of a bonus to keep someone company.</p>
<p id="p-100">I say this a lot.</p>
<p id="p-101">You want me to keep you company?</p>
<p id="p-102">That means you want me to like chat with you, kind of entertain you while you're working.</p>
<p id="p-103">Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-104">Or while you're doing anything.</p>
<p id="p-105">Maybe you're going, maybe you want to accompany someone to a doctor's visit and you're actually asking, do you want some support?</p>
<p id="p-106">But you're trying to lighten that and make it a little less serious.</p>
<p id="p-107">You might say, hey, would you like me to keep you company?</p>
<p id="p-108">I'll come to the doctor's visit with you, that kind of thing.</p>
<p id="p-109">Good point.</p>
<p id="p-110">Right, And this is often used.</p>
<p id="p-111">My grandmother would always say this.</p>
<p id="p-112">Come over and keep me company.</p>
<p id="p-113">I mean, just like chat with me.</p>
<p id="p-114">Maybe we'll do a word search together.</p>
<p id="p-115">Right, It's just like, let's just visit.</p>
<p id="p-116">And often instead we'll say, I'll keep you company or keep me company.</p>
<p id="p-117">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-118">Is there anything we have to know about car?</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-119">Is there anything we have to know about commas here when we're writing this?</p>
<p id="p-120">Yes, So for this construction, when you have an adverb clause, like when I was doing something here, you always have to use a comma after it when it comes at the beginning of a sentence.</p>
<p id="p-121">And this is because an adverb clause that starts a sentence is considered an introductory element, so it requires a comma to separate it from the main clause.</p>
<p id="p-122">And the tricky thing is here, depending on the construction of the sentence, there won't always be a comma.</p>
<p id="p-123">So the second one we're going to teach, there's no comma.</p>
<p id="p-124">Oh, okay, good to know.</p>
<p id="p-125">Introductory element sounds very fancy.</p>
<p id="p-126">Yes, it does, right?</p>
<p id="p-127">Kind of tricky grammar.</p>
<p id="p-128">And often we will use these introductory elements when we're trying to either up-level our speech or our writing, or trying to use complex sentences.</p>
<p id="p-129">And so we'll often use these to transition between ideas.</p>
<p id="p-130">Which I know a lot of our listeners are at that point in their learning.</p>
<p id="p-131">They're wanting to get more complex so that what they're saying can match what they're thinking.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-132">What they're saying can match what they're thinking, right?</p>
<p id="p-133">They have complex thoughts.</p>
<p id="p-134">You don't want to be just saying and writing simple choppy sentences when you have complex, interesting thoughts.</p>
<p id="p-135">You want them to be dressed, you know, gift wrapped just as fancy as your thoughts are.</p>
<p id="p-136">Exactly, and that's why we're here.</p>
<p id="p-137">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-138">All right, let's go through number two, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-139">What is the second scenario, grammar construction?</p>
<p id="p-140">Yes, right.</p>
<p id="p-141">Number two is, you know, something was done.</p>
<p id="p-142">I did something while something else was happening.</p>
<p id="p-143">So because it's flipped and the adverb clause at the end, it's not introductory.</p>
<p id="p-144">There's no comma in this construction.</p>
<p id="p-145">Okay, for example, you called me when I was shopping.</p>
<p id="p-146">Okay, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-147">No comma here, right?</p>
<p id="p-148">Because the adverb clause is at the end when I was shopping.</p>
<p id="p-149">So the first part of these sentences is the independent clause, right?</p>
<p id="p-150">You called me.</p>
<p id="p-151">That's a complete sentence.</p>
<p id="p-152">And then the second part is your adverb clause when I was shopping.</p>
<p id="p-153">So there we have the while or when subject and past progressive, which is was or were.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-154">past progressive, which is was or were depending on the verb, and then verb ing.</p>
<p id="p-155">Perfect.</p>
<p id="p-156">And the second example, he got home while I was making dinner.</p>
<p id="p-157">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-158">So your independent clause, he got home, that could be a sentence on its own.</p>
<p id="p-159">And then while I was making dinner is our adverb clause.</p>
<p id="p-160">No comma in this sentence because we're not introducing the sentence.</p>
<p id="p-161">It doesn't start the sentence.</p>
<p id="p-162">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-163">All right, Aubrey, we've gone through some pretty dense grammar here, which we love.</p>
<p id="p-164">We need this.</p>
<p id="p-165">We need the foundations, right?</p>
<p id="p-166">Let's go into a role play and see how it comes to light, comes to action.</p>
<p id="p-167">So you and I are classmates and I missed class last week.</p>
<p id="p-168">And so let's dive in here.</p>
<p id="p-169">All right.</p>
<p id="p-170">Where were you last week?</p>
<p id="p-171">I went to the beach.</p>
<p id="p-172">It was amazing.</p>
<p id="p-173">What?</p>
<p id="p-174">I was stuck in class while you were playing at the beach?</p>
<p id="p-175">I'm sorry.</p>
<p id="p-176">Actually, though, can I get your notes?</p>
<p id="p-177">Seriously?</p>
<p id="p-178">I'll owe you one.</p>
<p id="p-179">When I was hanging out on the sand, I thought,</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-180">I was hanging out on the sand, I thought.</p>
<p id="p-181">I hope Lindsay is taking notes so I can get them from her.</p>
<p id="p-182">I bet.</p>
<p id="p-183">Well, I have to miss class later this month, so be sure to take copious notes to share with me.</p>
<p id="p-184">Did you ever have that situation where a classmate would be like, I was at the beach, can I get your notes?</p>
<p id="p-185">Yeah, of course.</p>
<p id="p-186">That's so fun.</p>
<p id="p-187">And then you're there taking the notes.</p>
<p id="p-188">It's one thing if they were sick, if they're like, I was just on vacation.</p>
<p id="p-189">And you're like, here you go.</p>
<p id="p-190">You do it a little more grudgingly.</p>
<p id="p-191">Yeah, maybe write some incorrect things.</p>
<p id="p-192">You would never.</p>
<p id="p-193">Never, never.</p>
<p id="p-194">All right.</p>
<p id="p-195">So then what did we say here?</p>
<p id="p-196">So you said, I went to the beach.</p>
<p id="p-197">It was amazing.</p>
<p id="p-198">Yeah, And here you said, I was stuck in class while you were playing at the beach.</p>
<p id="p-199">So there's no comma here because our adverb clause is at the end, right?</p>
<p id="p-200">I was stuck in class is an independent clause, could be a sentence by itself.</p>
<p id="p-201">And then while you were playing at the beach, the adverb clause is at the end.</p>
<p id="p-202">So there'll be no comma in this sentence.</p>
<p id="p-203">Lovely.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-204">No comment in this sentence.</p>
<p id="p-205">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-206">And then the next thing you said, I'll owe you one.</p>
<p id="p-207">I would say I owe you one, right?</p>
<p id="p-208">I guess you're saying in the future, if you do this for me, I'll owe you one.</p>
<p id="p-209">Yeah, actually, that makes more sense.</p>
<p id="p-210">That makes more sense.</p>
<p id="p-211">Yeah, I'll owe you one.</p>
<p id="p-212">When I was hanging out in the sand, I thought, right?</p>
<p id="p-213">And then I narrate my thoughts.</p>
<p id="p-214">I thought, I hope Lindsay is taking good notes here.</p>
<p id="p-215">So this, again, when I was hanging out on the sand, we'll have a comma after it because this is an introductory adverb clause.</p>
<p id="p-216">We use this to introduce the thought to start the sentence.</p>
<p id="p-217">So after that adverb clause, we have a comma.</p>
<p id="p-218">And then after that will be an independent clause, a full sentence that could stand on its own.</p>
<p id="p-219">I thought, and then everything I was thinking.</p>
<p id="p-220">And it's important.</p>
<p id="p-221">This is not what today's episode is about, but it's important to know that we do change our tone of voice when we report our thinking.</p>
<p id="p-222">Right, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-223">Yes, right.</p>
<p id="p-224">That's a good point.</p>
<p id="p-225">If I just say, I thought I hope Lindsay is taking note, it would be sort of</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-226">I hope Lindsay is taking notes.</p>
<p id="p-227">It would be sort of confusing.</p>
<p id="p-228">We'll change our tone of voice to make it clear that we're narrating our thoughts.</p>
<p id="p-229">Yeah, So when I was hanging out on the sand, I thought, I hope Lindsay is taking notes so I can get them from her.</p>
<p id="p-230">There has to be some kind of a change in your tone there.</p>
<p id="p-231">Yeah, it sort of becomes a little sing-songy sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-232">I hope Lindsay is taking notes.</p>
<p id="p-233">I do that sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-234">For sure.</p>
<p id="p-235">Oh my gosh, this is fantastic.</p>
<p id="p-236">What's the takeaway for today?</p>
<p id="p-237">I know this is moving our listeners closer to where they want to be, expressing complex thoughts.</p>
<p id="p-238">Absolutely, right?</p>
<p id="p-239">Past progressive.</p>
<p id="p-240">It can be difficult to know whether to use past progressive or past simple.</p>
<p id="p-241">With this series, it will be a lot more clear to you which to choose, why natives choose one or the other.</p>
<p id="p-242">So definitely scroll up for part one.</p>
<p id="p-243">That was All Ears English 2360, your grammar questions answered, past simple or past progressive.</p>
