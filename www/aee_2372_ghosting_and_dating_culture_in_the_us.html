<p>Letter C, number 1. Hello, Aubrey.</p>
<p>How are you today?</p>
<p>Hello, Lindsay.</p>
<p>We are talking about dating</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>We are talking about dating today and I'm curious, do you think the dating scene has changed much since we were single?</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure it has.</p>
<p>It really has.</p>
<p>Last time I was single was like eight years ago, I think.</p>
<p>For me, it was 21 years.</p>
<p>But we got a great question about dating culture in the US.</p>
<p>And so I actually listened to a couple of dating podcasts, current dating podcasts, and learned some of the newer vocabulary.</p>
<p>My daughter is dating.</p>
<p>She has a boyfriend now, so I talked to her a little bit to get a little more in the know about dating because it has changed a ton with dating apps, which weren't as common when we were dating.</p>
<p>Now, that's the way to do it.</p>
<p>Like everybody's on the apps.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I thought it was social media was like taking over dating apps, but maybe I'm wrong.</p>
<p>I haven't talked to anyone about this in a long time.</p>
<p>It is both for sure.</p>
<p>People are</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>For sure, people are sliding into your DMs on Instagram especially.</p>
<p>But often they will meet on a dating app and then look that person up on Instagram and look at all their posts and then send them a DM on Instagram.</p>
<p>So it often starts with the dating apps.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Okay, you've done some research for this episode.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So this comes from a question, right?</p>
<p>From Golnaz.</p>
<p>Should I go ahead and read the question?</p>
<p>Yeah, let's do it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So here we go.</p>
<p>Golnaz says, thank you, All Ears English team.</p>
<p>Hi, Lindsay, Michelle, Jessica, and Aubrey.</p>
<p>I'm Golnaz from... And I wanted to say I really appreciate the amazing work the All Ears English team puts into this podcast.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I've learned so much from listening.</p>
<p>It has been both enjoyable and incredibly helpful for improving my English skills.</p>
<p>Your approach makes learning fun and relatable.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>That's the goal, right?</p>
<p>So when we get this feedback.</p>
<p>Yes, thank you.</p>
<p>It feels great.</p>
<p>It means a lot.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>Yes, thank you.</p>
<p>It feels great.</p>
<p>It means a lot to us.</p>
<p>It means the world to us, as we said.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I have a suggestion for future episodes.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to create some content related to dating culture in the US?</p>
<p>It would be great to learn about the cultural aspects as well as some useful idioms and vocabulary that are commonly used in dating contexts.</p>
<p>I think it would be very helpful for listeners navigating life here.</p>
<p>Thank you for all your hard work and keep up the fantastic job.</p>
<p>Oh, so good, Aubrey.</p>
<p>Such a great question.</p>
<p>And there are a ton of dating podcasts out there.</p>
<p>Some really fun ones.</p>
<p>One that I found is called You Up, which this is a big part of dating culture.</p>
<p>Often there's less commitment right away.</p>
<p>And so the You Up text is, you know, sort of well-known for people who are in situationships.</p>
<p>Maybe they're not committed to just one person, but they're texting each other to find out if they're still awake to meet up late night, maybe at a bar for drinks.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>maybe at a bar for drinks.</p>
<p>So it's interesting.</p>
<p>Sure that existed when we were single, but there are things that are changing about dating culture in the US.</p>
<p>I am very curious.</p>
<p>You know, I tried to kind of get updated, but this is probably, I don't know, how different this is around the world.</p>
<p>Oh, for sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, there are probably some commonalities around the world and some differences depending on culture and cultural differences, right?</p>
<p>So we have some really interesting vocabulary today.</p>
<p>I feel like I haven't even heard the first one before.</p>
<p>A lot of these might be new to you, Lindsay.</p>
<p>If you guys are dating in the US or if you've just moved to the US, you might not be familiar with these yet.</p>
<p>So we're excited to share some of this, the newest trendy vocabulary around dating.</p>
<p>So let's dive into that first.</p>
<p>And I'm sure each one will sort of bring up a conversation about what was this like when we were dating, how is dating culture changing?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the first one is breadcrumbing.</p>
<p>And so I know the term breadcrumbs from, you know, your internet.</p>
<p>Well, yeah.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>you know, your internet.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, certainly Hansel and Gretel.</p>
<p>And then online when you talk about building websites and things, kind of that people can find their way back to where they've been.</p>
<p>Right, But in dating, it's when you send occasional playful or flirtatious messages to keep someone interested, but without any plans to commit.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So it's interesting.</p>
<p>This is sort of a, has a negative connotation because that would be fine, of course, to send these messages if you think there's a chance for a relationship with this person, but it's definitely this connotation of like, someone was breadcrumbing me now.</p>
<p>And then later I find out they never had any plans to seriously date me.</p>
<p>They knew there would not be a relationship.</p>
<p>So this is sort of a very negative thing to do to someone.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Kind of mean, right?</p>
<p>Sort of.</p>
<p>And usually it reflects on insecurity from the person who's doing it, who's doing the breadcrumbing, right?</p>
<p>Right, The way we would have said this when I was dating was leading someone on like, she's just leading him on.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>She's just leading him on.</p>
<p>And that would be the same kind of thing.</p>
<p>Messages flirting with someone that you are not planning on dating seriously.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So again, another sample sentence.</p>
<p>I think she's just breadcrumbing me or he breadcrumbed me.</p>
<p>We're using it in the past tense there for our listeners.</p>
<p>He breadcrumbed me for months.</p>
<p>Right, So this can be used as a verb or a noun, right?</p>
<p>And that's what it means.</p>
<p>And often maybe it's not true, but if someone ends some kind of situationship and some kind of relationship and you find out maybe from their friends or from their lack of emotional connection, you feel like they never intended to date you seriously, then you might be like, I feel like they were just breadcrumbing me.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>And the next one, ghosting.</p>
<p>There was actually just an article about ghosting in the New York Times over the weekend, which I did scroll through because it's a fascinating topic, Aubrey.</p>
<p>Ghosting.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>It's really fascinating.</p>
<p>Before text messages, before social apps,</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>text messages before social apps, the only way to do this would be like if you're dating someone and you moved, maybe moved to another country and then just never called them again and never said anything, I guess that would have been sort of ghosting.</p>
<p>But it's definitely more common now that you can just block someone on with your phone and never see them.</p>
<p>It almost feels like though, ghosting in the past was just not following up and there was no way to follow up, right?</p>
<p>I think maybe now there's more expectation to officially close out something.</p>
<p>Well, let's define what it means, Aubrey, first.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>So ghosting, right, is when someone suddenly cuts off all communication without any explanation, typically in the context of a relationship.</p>
<p>So right, once upon a time, maybe you just stop calling each other, but there was less of an expectation.</p>
<p>Maybe you'd run into them in the grocery store, but it was very unlikely.</p>
<p>Whereas now you see their social media, you still see them online, but they're not messaging you anymore.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>But they're not messaging you anymore.</p>
<p>It's more strange.</p>
<p>I haven't thought of it in that context, actually.</p>
<p>I'm watching the show This Is Us.</p>
<p>I'm going through all of the episodes.</p>
<p>I love that show because I somehow missed it when it came out.</p>
<p>And so I'm thinking about when Jack and Rebecca were dating, it was the early 80s.</p>
<p>And I imagine if they had just gone out on a few dates and no one followed up, in today's context, that would be considered ghosting.</p>
<p>But there was no way.</p>
<p>You're not going to call and say, hey, I'm not going to call you again.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>You just don't call.</p>
<p>You just don't call.</p>
<p>So ghosting has become a thing with technology in a way.</p>
<p>But I also think it's really mean.</p>
<p>Right, And I think a lot of the reason it's more common now is because of the apps, because of social media.</p>
<p>People can be talking to multiple people at a time.</p>
<p>And that kind of means like flirting, texting, like the prelude to a relationship.</p>
<p>And then if you have a lot of people you're messaging and then you start to get more serious about one,</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>then you start to get more serious about one, what do you owe all of the rest of them?</p>
<p>Do you message them and say, I don't think we're the match?</p>
<p>Or do they just never hear from you again?</p>
<p>And that would be ghosting them.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's a very common word right now in our zeitgeist, right?</p>
<p>It was in the New York Times over the weekend.</p>
<p>I mean, a whole episode, a whole article about why they interviewed people in their 20s, 30s, 40s, and talked about why they ghosted their partner last time.</p>
<p>It was really kind of a psychological deep dive.</p>
<p>If our listeners are interested in psychology, really interesting.</p>
<p>That would be really interesting.</p>
<p>Definitely check it out.</p>
<p>Let's do a couple of just quick examples.</p>
<p>Maybe, can you believe he ghosted me after we had been dating for six weeks?</p>
<p>So this would be, wow, if you're actually going on dates, it's not just messaging, and then you never hear from them again, that would feel pretty extreme.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Here's another one.</p>
<p>I am not a ghoster.</p>
<p>I always let someone know if I think it's not a match.</p>
<p>Yes, And so here we're using it to describe ourselves and be like, I would never</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>describe ourselves and be like, I would never ghost anyone.</p>
<p>I'm not a ghoster.</p>
<p>That means I'm always going to message them and let them know if it's not working out for me.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Very common phrase.</p>
<p>Really important for dating right now in 2025, Aubrey.</p>
<p>What would be the next one?</p>
<p>All right, the next one is cuffing.</p>
<p>And this is committing to one partner.</p>
<p>It's derived from the word handcuffed.</p>
<p>So you're cuffing yourself to someone.</p>
<p>You have all of these situations, you have all of these people you're talking to.</p>
<p>And then if you define the relationship and decide to start dating just one person, it's called cuffing.</p>
<p>And then we also have cuffing season.</p>
<p>What is that, Lindsay?</p>
<p>Yes, I've heard this.</p>
<p>The colder months of the year when people are more likely to want to be in a relationship.</p>
<p>Yeah, I remember.</p>
<p>You go through the summer, you're just talking to all of these people, then it starts getting cold.</p>
<p>I remember in my friend group in New York when I was living there, all of a sudden I looked around, all these people were breaking up around March, April, and I'm thinking, why?</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>thinking, why?</p>
<p>What's happening?</p>
<p>The weather's getting warmer.</p>
<p>They're dating lots of people and then they might have been in a relationship again by October.</p>
<p>Yeah, they want to be free, be out in the world in New York.</p>
<p>So really interesting.</p>
<p>So let's do some samples.</p>
<p>Yeah, you might hear, he acted like I was cuffing him when I asked where this is going.</p>
<p>So this would be like if someone's like, I feel like one person is trying to make the relationship more serious to find it before someone else is ready.</p>
<p>And that's always awkward.</p>
<p>That never works out.</p>
<p>Right, when one person feels like they're being cuffed or trying to nail down or something is another word I might use.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Try to nail somebody down, just to get someone to commit.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Here's another sample.</p>
<p>I can tell it's cuffing season.</p>
<p>I want someone to snuggle up with in front of a fire.</p>
<p>It's just a human thing, right?</p>
<p>You can see the patterns.</p>
<p>Yeah, or you can say, I can tell it's cuffing season.</p>
<p>All of my friends are starting to get serious with their</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>are starting to get serious with their significant others.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Next one I know for sure, and this is the thing we never want to end up in if we're around our love interest.</p>
<p>And what is it, Aubrey?</p>
<p>The friend zone.</p>
<p>So to get friend zoned, someone you're interested in romantically makes it clear that they only think of you as a friend.</p>
<p>That's happened to all of us.</p>
<p>If you're out there listening and you're in this situation, we have solidarity.</p>
<p>We've all been there.</p>
<p>We feel you.</p>
<p>It's happened to everyone on the planet, I'm sure.</p>
<p>She told me last night that I'm such a good friend.</p>
<p>I think I'm officially friend zoned.</p>
<p>So use it a verb that way.</p>
<p>I'm friend zoned.</p>
<p>Or I keep getting put in the friend zone.</p>
<p>It's used as a noun here.</p>
<p>I don't know what I'm doing wrong.</p>
<p>Very common.</p>
<p>So these are four really, really common dating terms right now in 2025.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Okay, Aubrey, we are back.</p>
<p>Let's go into a little role play.</p>
<p>This should be fun.</p>
<p>Dating talk, right?</p>
<p>So we are not ourselves.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>right?</p>
<p>So we are not ourselves here.</p>
<p>We are Flavia and Margo and we are discussing our friend Lily's dating life.</p>
<p>I'll start us out.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I think Lily is bread crumbing this guy.</p>
<p>She doesn't seem interested at all.</p>
<p>Yeah, she probably needs to friend zone him if she knows it's not going anywhere.</p>
<p>Yeah, she's pretty bad at ghosting.</p>
<p>She'll probably just block him one day and he'll never hear from her again.</p>
<p>Who knows though?</p>
<p>Maybe we'll hit cuffing season and she'll decide to commit.</p>
<p>So geez.</p>
<p>I love this.</p>
<p>I'm like we need to be talking about someone else.</p>
<p>I feel like this could come off as very negative.</p>
<p>A lot of these do have this negative connotation of leading someone on of not being respectful of someone else's feelings, but it does happen.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>This is how a lot of dating conversations sound I suppose, right?</p>
<p>I suppose.</p>
<p>So okay, so you said I think Lily is bread crumbing this guy and it's interesting how we use that word as a verb.</p>
<p>We conjugate it.</p>
<p>He's bread crumbing</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>She's bread crumbing this guy.</p>
<p>This is something she's currently doing.</p>
<p>She's sending flirty texts, leading him on, but maybe telling me, I know this isn't going to work.</p>
<p>I know this isn't going anywhere, and then showing me the texts she's sending.</p>
<p>So I'd be like, wow, you're bread crumbing this guy.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>And then what?</p>
<p>Friend zone?</p>
<p>Yes, you said she probably needs to friend zone him if she knows it's not going anywhere.</p>
<p>So we're just sort of seeing our friend not being serious about someone, and though no one wants to get friend zoned, that's the better option if you know there's no future.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>And then you said she's pretty bad at ghosting, right?</p>
<p>Meaning she doesn't have... Well, how can you be good or bad at ghosting?</p>
<p>It's just kind of stopping the communication, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think this... If I said this, she's pretty bad at ghosting, it means to me that she does it a lot, and I don't think it's a good thing to do.</p>
<p>Oh, I thought you meant she doesn't have a skill.</p>
<p>She's not skilled at ghosting.</p>
<p>That's just an interesting language feature.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>language feature, a language chunk, where it kind of could mean either thing, right?</p>
<p>If I'm saying she's bad at ghosting, maybe I mean she doesn't do it often because it's a bad thing to do, right?</p>
<p>Oh, it could mean a lot of things.</p>
<p>It could mean a lot of things.</p>
<p>So you'll have to listen to intonation, listen for context.</p>
<p>But here I meant like she's bad at doing that to people.</p>
<p>She's bad at ghosting people.</p>
<p>She's done it a lot.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we could say something like, oh, she's always ghosting people.</p>
<p>She's always ghosting people would mean the same thing.</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>And then I said, who knows though?</p>
<p>Maybe we'll hit cuffing season and she'll commit, right?</p>
<p>She'll decide to commit.</p>
<p>Right, whether it'll get colder and she'll realize maybe I do like this person.</p>
<p>Yeah, excellent.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>So Aubrey, this is part of a series, right?</p>
<p>Let's hear about the series.</p>
<p>Where is the next episode in this series going to be?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is going to be really interesting.</p>
<p>Part two will be on the Business English podcast.</p>
<p>Should you talk about dating at work?</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p>Should you talk about dating at work?</p>
<p>Because you have vocabulary, you know a lot now about dating culture in the US, but should you bring it up at work, to whom, in what context?</p>
<p>So be sure to follow Business English if you're not so you don't miss that episode.</p>
