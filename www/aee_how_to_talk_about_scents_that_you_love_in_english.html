<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p id="p-10">We break down these nuanced terms and show you how to connect over the topic of nostalgic smells and scents in English.</p>
<p id="p-11">Hello there, Michelle, what's going on today?</p>
<p id="p-12">How are you?</p>
<p id="p-13">I'm good.</p>
<p id="p-14">How are you?</p>
<p id="p-15">Feeling good.</p>
<p id="p-16">Feeling good.</p>
<p id="p-17">The sun is shining in Denver, but I do have a question for you.</p>
<p id="p-18">Yes, All right.</p>
<p id="p-19">So do you wear perfume?</p>
<p id="p-20">Michelle, on a regular basis, are you wearing perfume right now for our recording?</p>
<p id="p-21">No.</p>
<p id="p-22">I don't wear perfume.</p>
<p id="p-23">You don't wear perfume.</p>
<p id="p-24">No.</p>
<p id="p-25">I don't wear perfume.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-26">Can't you smell it?</p>
<p id="p-27">No.</p>
<p id="p-28">No, I don't wear perfume.</p>
<p id="p-29">There was, I think there is, I think maybe when I was a teenager, I had a little body spray.</p>
<p id="p-30">There was one time where I did have a perfume that I liked to use, not all the time, but no, I don't use it.</p>
<p id="p-31">Do you?</p>
<p id="p-32">No.</p>
<p id="p-33">I kind of also had that phase.</p>
<p id="p-34">I don't know if it's a phase thing or if it was a time, the 90s, the odds.</p>
<p id="p-35">But in high school, I used to wear a particular scent, Gap Dream.</p>
<p id="p-36">I loved it.</p>
<p id="p-37">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-38">Gap Dream.</p>
<p id="p-39">But that, I don't know, that just went away.</p>
<p id="p-40">I guess in college I just stopped wearing it and I haven't really worn scents since then.</p>
<p id="p-41">Yeah, Every once in a while you meet someone who has a scent, right?</p>
<p id="p-42">And sometimes it's too much, but sometimes it's very nice, right?</p>
<p id="p-43">Sometimes it's like, oh, that's such a good </p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-44">Sometimes it's like, oh, that's such a good scent, and now you know that person by that perfume and kind of... Right, Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-45">It's so true.</p>
<p id="p-46">Smells are so visceral, right?</p>
<p id="p-47">Even I imagine if you're close to the person, like 15 years later, you could smell that and think of that person, honestly.</p>
<p id="p-48">Not just someone you pass, but someone you know that has the scent they wear all the time.</p>
<p id="p-49">It's incredible.</p>
<p id="p-50">Yeah, It really is.</p>
<p id="p-51">It really is.</p>
<p id="p-52">So today, we're going to answer a listener question about words dealing with scents.</p>
<p id="p-53">In 2020, we did an episode a little bit touching on this topic, but we're going to go over new words today and review a couple.</p>
<p id="p-54">So I'm excited for today's episode.</p>
<p id="p-55">Yeah, Before we get started, guys, we want to make sure you know that the best place to listen to All Ears English is where, Michelle?</p>

<p id="p-67">Would you read it for us?</p>
<p id="p-68">Sure.</p>
<p id="p-69">This is from Sophia.</p>
<p id="p-70">So Sophia says, hi, I am Sophia.</p>
<p id="p-71">Excuse me.</p>
<p id="p-72">I just wanted to say a big thank you for your awesome podcasts.</p>
<p id="p-73">They've been super helpful and I've learned so much from them.</p>
<p id="p-74">Your explanations of English usage are always spot on.</p>
<p id="p-75">Well, thank you, Sophia.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-76">Always spot on.</p>
<p id="p-77">Well, thank you, Sophia.</p>
<p id="p-78">We appreciate that.</p>
<p id="p-79">Thanks for listening.</p>
<p id="p-80">Yeah, Okay.</p>
<p id="p-81">Now, Sophia says, I have a quick question.</p>
<p id="p-82">Could you clarify the difference between aroma, fragrance, perfume, and scent?</p>
<p id="p-83">I'm curious about how these words are used differently.</p>
<p id="p-84">Thanks a lot for your help and for all the great content.</p>
<p id="p-85">Best, Sophia.</p>
<p id="p-86">Thanks so much, Sophia.</p>
<p id="p-87">That's a great question.</p>
<p id="p-88">It's a really specific question, but I love that our listener, Sophia, is at this level, right?</p>
<p id="p-89">She's able to know the difference between these four words.</p>
<p id="p-90">Very high level.</p>
<p id="p-91">And that is the way to push your level from B2 into C1.</p>
<p id="p-92">I love it, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-93">Right, Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-94">So let's go over it.</p>
<p id="p-95">So let's start with perfume.</p>
<p id="p-96">Just because we were already talking about this.</p>
<p id="p-97">So what is perfume?</p>
<p id="p-98">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-99">Perfume is usually you find it in a bottle.</p>
<p id="p-100">Usually it's branded with a brand name like Chanel.</p>
<p id="p-101">The one that I mentioned, Gap Dream, or Vera Wang, the big brands, Burberry.</p>
<p id="p-102">All the big brands, they have a scent or two or three or.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-103">have a scent or two or three or ten, right?</p>
<p id="p-104">Right, Sometimes when you're in a mall, you would spray it on your wrist or they give you little samples on your neck or maybe people walk into it, they spray it in the air and walk into it.</p>
<p id="p-105">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-106">What is the proper way to apply perfume, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-107">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-108">I think I always used to do the spray and walk into it.</p>
<p id="p-109">What about you?</p>
<p id="p-110">I think I usually just spray it on my neck and my wrist.</p>
<p id="p-111">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-112">This is so long ago, to be honest.</p>
<p id="p-113">Yeah, And then there's aroma, right?</p>
<p id="p-114">Aroma.</p>
<p id="p-115">So now this isn't necessarily what we spray, what we pay money for in a department store and spray on our, but it's connected, right?</p>
<p id="p-116">Right, Right, Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-117">So this is, oh, I also want to say about perfume, a lot of times celebrities are associated with perfume.</p>
<p id="p-118">So you'll see in the mall, Catherine Zeta-Jones or, you know, whoever it is, Selena Gomez, I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-119">And they're, they're all with their perfumes.</p>
<p id="p-120">Yes, That's true.</p>
<p id="p-121">Perfumes always have like the.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-122">And it's always, perfumes always have like the wackiest commercials.</p>
<p id="p-123">They do, they do, they do.</p>
<p id="p-124">Lots of models and things.</p>
<p id="p-125">And very intense, sexy-sounding music.</p>
<p id="p-126">Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to be on a shoot like that, a video shoot for a commercial like that, you know?</p>
<p id="p-127">Black and white.</p>
<p id="p-128">Wow, what a world.</p>
<p id="p-129">I guess in New York, you do sometimes run into that, right?</p>
<p id="p-130">You see those shoots happening in Central Park, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-131">Could be, could be.</p>
<p id="p-132">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-133">So, but yeah, so aroma could be a perfume.</p>
<p id="p-134">But generally, it's used to talk about a good smell, right?</p>
<p id="p-135">So it could be any smell, though.</p>
<p id="p-136">So for example, they say the aroma of freshly baked cookies can help to sell a house.</p>
<p id="p-137">Have you ever heard that?</p>
<p id="p-138">I have heard that before.</p>
<p id="p-139">I don't know if that's a myth or if there's any science linked to that, but people tend to gravitate where there are cookies, right?</p>
<p id="p-140">So if you weren't going to do an open house, if you're going to do an open house, you might as well make cookies, right?</p>
<p id="p-141">That's really funny.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-142">Yeah, no, that's good.</p>
<p id="p-143">So aroma, though, is usually only used if it's a good smell, right?</p>
<p id="p-144">Right, I don't think you would say that.</p>
<p id="p-145">Yeah, right.</p>
<p id="p-146">I don't imagine.</p>
<p id="p-147">I think so.</p>
<p id="p-148">It's like the aroma of like a trash.</p>
<p id="p-149">No.</p>
<p id="p-150">We have a lot of words to choose from when it comes to smells.</p>
<p id="p-151">And we can do another episode on bad smells, right?</p>
<p id="p-152">Oh, that reeks.</p>
<p id="p-153">Lots of words.</p>
<p id="p-154">Right, I know that we talked about, you know, in that other episode, I believe it was that we did scent and smell and how and how those can be a little bit different in terms of the good if it's a good or bad.</p>
<p id="p-155">Yes, But but yeah, I like that idea of saying something smells.</p>
<p id="p-156">Oh, there's so much we could go.</p>
<p id="p-157">So pay attention, guys.</p>
<p id="p-158">Maybe they'll be a part two of this episode.</p>
<p id="p-159">So aroma is a perfume aroma.</p>
<p id="p-160">Now the next one, Michelle,</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-161">Next one, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-162">Fragrance.</p>
<p id="p-163">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-164">Yeah, So this one is interesting.</p>
<p id="p-165">It's a little bit more tricky, in my opinion.</p>
<p id="p-166">It could be a perfume.</p>
<p id="p-167">So you might call a perfume a fragrance.</p>
<p id="p-168">You could say, what fragrance are you wearing?</p>
<p id="p-169">But it could also just be the smell.</p>
<p id="p-170">So the fragrance of flowers really set the mood.</p>
<p id="p-171">What do you think about this one?</p>
<p id="p-172">Oh, wow.</p>
<p id="p-173">This is very specific.</p>
<p id="p-174">Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p id="p-175">I think what fragrance are you wearing is definitely a chunk that our listeners should remember.</p>
<p id="p-176">I wouldn't say, what aroma are you wearing?</p>
<p id="p-177">Would you?</p>
<p id="p-178">No.</p>
<p id="p-179">Probably not.</p>
<p id="p-180">Right?</p>
<p id="p-181">For perfume?</p>
<p id="p-182">Right, And fragrance is kind of good, I guess, as an umbrella term, because you have perfume and cologne.</p>
<p id="p-183">Right?</p>
<p id="p-184">Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Whatever it is.</p>
<p id="p-185">100%. Yeah, So I think fragrance and perfume kind of go together, in a sense.</p>
<p id="p-186">Perfume is like the product.</p>
<p id="p-187">It's the type of product.</p>
<p id="p-188">Right?</p>
<p id="p-189">Yeah, I don't know if I said this before, but it is often used for cologne or perfume, cologne, and perfume.</p>
<p id="p-190">So I think it's a great product.</p>
<p id="p-191">Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, </p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-192">often used for cologne or perfume.</p>
<p id="p-193">Cologne is usually for men and perfume is for women, but I have heard it interchanged sometimes that more women saying cologne, but I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-194">So fragrance could also be about flowers, right?</p>
<p id="p-195">Or other nice, again, positive scents, good scents.</p>
<p id="p-196">Yeah, Right, right, exactly, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-197">So now let's just go into scent.</p>
<p id="p-198">So again, this could also be perfume.</p>
<p id="p-199">Right, what scent are you wearing?</p>
<p id="p-200">Yeah, What scent are you wearing?</p>
<p id="p-201">Oh, I love it, right?</p>
<p id="p-202">Or it could be more general.</p>
<p id="p-203">Strawberry is my favorite scent.</p>
<p id="p-204">Right, or is there a cake in here?</p>
<p id="p-205">I can smell a strong scent.</p>
<p id="p-206">So that's for positive things.</p>
<p id="p-207">It also, I think about like bloodhounds or something, dogs, like dogs.</p>
<p id="p-208">That's also used not just for things that we use to make things smell good.</p>
<p id="p-209">It could also be bloodhounds are trained to follow a scent on a criminal investigation.</p>
<p id="p-210">They go out in the woods and they look for the scent of blood or scent of.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-211">and they look for the scent of blood or scent of something.</p>
<p id="p-212">Or even in the airport, in DIA.</p>
<p id="p-213">That's what I was thinking.</p>
<p id="p-214">Yeah, In DIA, it's a big place where you have a lot of dogs sniffing out drugs, right?</p>
<p id="p-215">Things like that.</p>
<p id="p-216">So this one is not just for these beautiful smells of flowers and perfumes.</p>
<p id="p-217">Yeah, Right, Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-218">Okay, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-219">Wow.</p>
<p id="p-220">Do you have a good sense of smell?</p>
<p id="p-221">Would you say?</p>
<p id="p-222">I think so.</p>
<p id="p-223">Do you?</p>
<p id="p-224">I think my sense of smell is not that great, to be honest.</p>
<p id="p-225">I think it could be much better.</p>
<p id="p-226">So can you be more specific?</p>
<p id="p-227">Because I don't even really know.</p>
<p id="p-228">No, just sometimes someone says, oh, I smell something, and I just don't really smell it.</p>
<p id="p-229">Or it's just less prominent for me.</p>
<p id="p-230">It's light.</p>
<p id="p-231">And someone will say, it's a very strong smell.</p>
<p id="p-232">You can't smell it?</p>
<p id="p-233">No.</p>
<p id="p-234">What are you talking about?</p>
<p id="p-235">Well, did you ever lose your sense of smell during COVID?</p>
<p id="p-236">Yeah, a few times.</p>
<p id="p-237">But I couldn't tell if it was, this is just the smell, losing the smell of a cold, because that happens too.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-238">like a cold, because that happens too when you get a cold.</p>
<p id="p-239">But I think it's quite different when you have COVID.</p>
<p id="p-240">It's just a full loss.</p>
<p id="p-241">It's like on and off.</p>
<p id="p-242">It's not gradually going away.</p>
<p id="p-243">So yeah, yeah, yeah, interesting.</p>
<p id="p-244">Um, well, let's talk about wearing a strong scent or perfume.</p>
<p id="p-245">I mean, is there any time do you think that you should avoid wearing a perfume, a cologne?</p>
<p id="p-246">I think these days more than before, I think that the consciousness around this has been raised a bit because people now their allergies, people are allergic to certain scents.</p>
<p id="p-247">So I think for example, when I, my old meditation center back in Cambridge, they used to do announcements and say, you know, please avoid wearing a center.</p>
<p id="p-248">Please wash it off as you enter the meditation center as people are allergic.</p>
<p id="p-249">So it's a way of being socially conscious.</p>
<p id="p-250">Yeah, Um, yeah, that's one thing I would say, Michelle, anything to add there?</p>
<p id="p-251">Yeah, I think a job interview is a bad idea.</p>
<p id="p-252">Job interview.</p>
<p id="p-253">No, you don't. Yeah, You don't know who might have a reaction to it and then you're just gonna kind of make them upset.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-254">And you're just going to kind of make them upset.</p>
<p id="p-255">Yeah, And people have different levels of strength of their smell.</p>
<p id="p-256">So even your shampoo could be very strong for someone and that could be enough.</p>
<p id="p-257">You know what I mean?</p>
<p id="p-258">Like don't overwhelm.</p>
<p id="p-259">Just be careful at a job interview.</p>
<p id="p-260">Right, Right, Yes, Yeah, So Lindsay, do you have any strong reactions to certain scents?</p>
<p id="p-261">Or do you have a favorite scent?</p>
<p id="p-262">I think all of our listeners are going to resonate with this.</p>
<p id="p-263">It's no specific one I can think of, but it's just or even the smell of cotton balls makes me think of my grandmother.</p>
<p id="p-264">Because sweaters, wool sweaters, the ocean makes me think of my parents because they lived at the ocean.</p>
<p id="p-265">It's just and it's so visceral, it's such an important part of our lives.</p>
<p id="p-266">Mm hmm.</p>
<p id="p-267">Mm hmm.</p>
<p id="p-268">Do you have a smell that you don't like?</p>
<p id="p-269">I mean, well, there's the obvious.</p>
<p id="p-270">Nothing that comes to mind.</p>
<p id="p-271">Anything particular for you that's really repulsive for you, where it's just like a knee jerk reaction.</p>
<p id="p-272">This reminds me, I mean, I don't love the smell of like smoke and.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-273">of like smoke.</p>
<p id="p-274">And I mean, what about so Dan loves the smell.</p>
<p id="p-275">He says that this weird gas station smell like that.</p>
<p id="p-276">Some people, some people like, yeah, some people like that smell or maybe even like a strong barbecue smell or those kinds of people don't like that.</p>
<p id="p-277">Totally.</p>
<p id="p-278">I actually have a really fond of fondness for the smell of charcoal barbecue charcoal because in the 80s, that's what we didn't know that it was danger.</p>
<p id="p-279">Like that's what we used right now.</p>
<p id="p-280">It's kind of like not the safest thing to use.</p>
<p id="p-281">And people mostly use gas grills.</p>
<p id="p-282">But in the 80s, we add the charcoal things and pour the lighter fluid on it.</p>
<p id="p-283">And there's your there's your barbecue.</p>
<p id="p-284">And it makes me think of my dad and making burgers on.</p>
<p id="p-285">So I think our listeners are 100 percent going to resonate with today's episode because smells are life.</p>
<p id="p-286">Smells are memories.</p>
<p id="p-287">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-288">I mean, so I mean, like the people maybe the smell of freshly cut grass.</p>
<p id="p-289">Oh, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-290">My parents recently got a new car and there is.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-291">My parents recently got a new car and there is new car smell, they call it, right?</p>
<p id="p-292">Sure, people love that.</p>
<p id="p-293">Well, I remember when I went into their car the first time, it was like, oh, it's a new car smell.</p>
<p id="p-294">It's really nice.</p>
<p id="p-295">It's nice.</p>
<p id="p-296">Or what are your thoughts on, this is a divisive one, what are your thoughts on the smell of a campfire in your hair, like after you've gone into your tent?</p>
<p id="p-297">Do you like that or do you not like that?</p>
<p id="p-298">You think I go into a tent?</p>
<p id="p-299">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-300">You don't camp.</p>
<p id="p-301">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-302">We're in two different worlds.</p>
<p id="p-303">No, I would.</p>
<p id="p-304">No, I don't know, but I would.</p>
<p id="p-305">I would camp and I have, but no, I don't like the smell of smoke in my hair.</p>
<p id="p-306">I don't know if it's so much campfire or more like cigarette smoke because it does kind of have a different... I see it as very different.</p>
<p id="p-307">I hate the smell of cigarette smoke in my hair or in general cigarette smoke, but campfire smoke, I love it because it means I've been outdoors.</p>
<p id="p-308">I've been sitting around a campfire.</p>
<p id="p-309">I'm camping.</p>
<p id="p-310">I'm in the woods.</p>
<p id="p-311">It's a really positive thing for me.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-312">it's a really positive thing for me.</p>
<p id="p-313">But some people hate that, that it lingers.</p>
<p id="p-314">They just don't want that in there around them lingering.</p>
<p id="p-315">Yeah, right, right, right.</p>
<p id="p-316">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-317">Anyways, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-318">But overall, guys, these words are fairly similar.</p>
<p id="p-319">But I'd say perfume and cologne are more about the actual spray.</p>
<p id="p-320">Whereas fragrance or scent can be about either one.</p>
<p id="p-321">And aroma is kind of the overall feel or smell the aroma of a coffee shop, right?</p>
<p id="p-322">Oh, yeah, so good.</p>
<p id="p-323">We're gonna have to do a follow up, Michelle, on the negative side for negative scents and smells and things to say.</p>
<p id="p-324">So but let's do a role play for today to solidify what we've learned for our listeners.</p>
<p id="p-325">So here, Michelle, we are carpooling to a party and you just pick me up at my place.</p>
<p id="p-326">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-327">All right.</p>
<p id="p-328">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-329">You look great.</p>
<p id="p-330">Thanks.</p>
<p id="p-331">Oh, wow.</p>
<p id="p-332">Did you get a new perfume?</p>
<p id="p-333">Yes, Got this new fragrance by Julia Roberts.</p>
<p id="p-334">Oh, it's really good.</p>
<p id="p-335">Sometimes those scents can bother my allergies.</p>
<p id="p-336">But this just smells great.</p>
<p id="p-337">Oh, good.</p>
<p id="p-338">I'm glad.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-339">great.</p>
<p id="p-340">Oh, good.</p>
<p id="p-341">I'm glad.</p>
<p id="p-342">Yeah, Dan sometimes wears this cologne that is just too strong.</p>
<p id="p-343">Okay, don't mind the aroma in my car of cake.</p>
<p id="p-344">Well, why would I mind that?</p>
<p id="p-345">It may make you hungry.</p>
<p id="p-346">I'll try some at the party.</p>
<p id="p-347">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-348">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-349">Yes, Who?</p>
<p id="p-350">No, I even the smell of like Dunkin Donuts.</p>
<p id="p-351">Walk into Dunkin Donuts.</p>
<p id="p-352">You can smell the donut shop.</p>
<p id="p-353">Yum.</p>
<p id="p-354">Yes, Or subway and like do subway don't they have an actual spray that they it's the bread isn't. Yeah, I guess that's true.</p>
<p id="p-355">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-356">So well, this is a fun conversation.</p>
<p id="p-357">It could go on forever.</p>
<p id="p-358">But let's go back to the sense here.</p>
<p id="p-359">So you said, Oh, wow, did you get a new perfume?</p>
<p id="p-360">And again, that is the product, right?</p>
<p id="p-361">Yes, that presents a certain fragrance.</p>
<p id="p-362">So you said, Yes, I got this new fragrance by Julia Roberts.</p>
<p id="p-363">I think she actually does have one.</p>
<p id="p-364">I always see her face on one.</p>
<p id="p-365">Oh, really?</p>
<p id="p-366">Yeah, And then I said, sometimes those</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p id="p-367">I said, uh, sometimes those scents can bother my allergies, but this just smells great.</p>
<p id="p-368">So you're saying usually I have a problem, but this one's fine.</p>
<p id="p-369">Um, and then you said, yeah, Dan sometimes where's his cologne, this cologne that is just too strong.</p>
<p id="p-370">So that's the men's version of perfume generally is what we would say.</p>
<p id="p-371">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-372">Um, but it's not true.</p>
<p id="p-373">He's, he, he's fine.</p>
<p id="p-374">Um, but I said, I said, okay.</p>
<p id="p-375">Uh, and then I said, okay, don't mind the aroma in my car of cake.</p>
<p id="p-376">Right, Um, I guess I could have said the aroma of cake in my car.</p>
<p id="p-377">That would have been more correct.</p>
<p id="p-378">But, um, but yeah, so basically it smells like cake and then you're like, why would I mind that?</p>
<p id="p-379">Yeah, Who would mind that?</p>
<p id="p-380">Uh, all right.</p>
<p id="p-381">Good stuff.</p>
<p id="p-382">Michelle, where's another episode our listeners could check out after this one is done to keep going with their sassy Saturday today.</p>

<p id="p-389">Anything?</p>
<p id="p-390">Yeah, I mean, this is, this is a really good specific question that shows that this listener, this listener, Sophia, is thinking at this higher level, that's really going to push her up.</p>
<p id="p-391">But again, sometimes they can be used interchangeably, but we gave you the main differences today, so try it out and definitely be aware of, I'm curious culturally if other scents, other, it's okay to wear perfumes, strong scents, or has it, is the tide kind of changing all over the world where it's, you have to be a little more sensitive about that.</p>
