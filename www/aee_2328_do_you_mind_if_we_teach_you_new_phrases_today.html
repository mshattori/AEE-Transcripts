<p>In today's episode, our listener Omid asks us how to use the word mind.</p>
<p>We show you three key meanings of this word.</p>
<p>Plus we give you tips.</p>
<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p>word, plus we give you tips on one way to open a connection with one key mind phrase.</p>
<p>Hey, Michelle, I've got a question for you today.</p>
<p>Oh, what's the question?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So who is in your mind, the best actor or actress of our generation?</p>
<p>Ooh, okay, well, I guess I mean, I think the easy answer is Tom Hanks.</p>
<p>Yes, That's who I would go with.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Geez.</p>
<p>Oh, Meryl Streep.</p>
<p>Meryl Streep.</p>
<p>I think Meryl Streep is fantastic.</p>
<p>She's really good.</p>
<p>Kathy Bates is really good.</p>
<p>Oh, she is very good.</p>
<p>She's really good.</p>
<p>I'm thinking, oh, Judi Dench.</p>
<p>Okay, Judi Dench.</p>
<p>I think Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic.</p>
<p>Yeah, Judi Dench, I don't know her, but I don't know her either.</p>
<p>No, I just, I don't know her personally.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>I don't know her personally.</p>
<p>You were saying, oh, I don't know.</p>
<p>Could you introduce me?</p>
<p>Right, No.</p>
<p>Yeah, That's funny.</p>
<p>So it's a great question.</p>
<p>And in the question I asked you, who in your mind is the best actor?</p>
<p>So that is giving our listeners a little hint into what we're talking about today in your mind.</p>
<p>And this idea of the word mind and so many different ways we use it in English.</p>
<p>Right, Oh, yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>So we are going to get into that today because we have a great listener question.</p>
<p>We love your questions, guys.</p>
<p>Before we do that, Lindsay, we've been doing these fun polls on Spotify, and we're going to share the results for one of our polls today.</p>
<p>And this was this was a fun one.</p>
<p>Remember this episode?</p>
<p>It was a Saturday episode.</p>
<p>It was What's Your Return Policy?</p>
<p>English Vocabulary for Shopping.</p>
<p>So guys, if you haven't listened to that one, definitely head on over.</p>
<p>It was a sassy Saturday.</p>
<p>And we asked the question, you know, because we got into conversation about norms and kind of cultural norms.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>and kind of cultural norms, expectations about taking price tags off of gifts before you gift the gift, right?</p>
<p>And we asked, do you take price tags off of gifts?</p>
<p>Yes or no.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>We have an overwhelming majority, 84% yes, and 15% said no.</p>
<p>I'm curious about the people that said no.</p>
<p>That doesn't equal 100%. Doesn't equal 100%. We'll just pretend.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Our math is a little silly, but we don't know, but yeah.</p>
<p>So I wonder about the nos, if in your culture, it's not expected the way it is here, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, It's a little bit of a faux pas here to leave the price tag on when you gift something.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm, right.</p>
<p>So very interesting.</p>
<p>So thanks for answering that, everyone.</p>
<p>And today we're gonna answer this listener question about the word mind.</p>
<p>And guys, we wanna remind you to hit follow wherever you are listening to the All Ears English podcast so you never miss anything from us, never miss a bonus.</p>
<p>Yes, Let us come to you.</p>
<p>Don't miss a thing.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>It's a thing.</p>
<p>All right, and don't forget, we're also on YouTube, which is exactly where this question came from.</p>
<p>Michelle, shall I go ahead and read the question?</p>
<p>All right, please do.</p>
<p>All right, this is from omandzakari7393.</p>
<p>He or she says, hi, Lindsay and Michelle.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your amazing podcast.</p>
<p>I've been listening to your podcast for about nine years.</p>
<p>Michelle, this is amazing.</p>
<p>This is a nine-year listener.</p>
<p>This is- Nine-year listener.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, this is so wonderful.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Almost since we started the show.</p>
<p>We started the show 10 years ago, so that's truly amazing.</p>
<p>We love our long-time listeners and our new listeners, of course.</p>
<p>Yes, All right, so would you mind telling me the various meanings of mind?</p>
<p>Because I think it has many meanings.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance, Omid from Iran.</p>
<p>Fantastic question, Omid.</p>
<p>Great question, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, we could just talk, we could do a whole course on the word mind.</p>
<p>I mean, we could do a whole podcast, all ears English mind.</p>
<p>Yeah, because there's just so many.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>because there's just so many ways to use the word mind, including in idioms and just so many ways, I can't even count.</p>
<p>But today we're gonna focus, and we can always do follow-ups, we can always do more, but we're gonna focus on three main ways that we use it today.</p>
<p>I like that idea, Michelle.</p>
<p>Let's break it up kind of into three buckets, in a way, of buckets of meaning, right?</p>
<p>Three different buckets, and that'll keep it simple.</p>
<p>And then, of course, like you said, we can do other episodes.</p>
<p>If there's a specific phrase our listeners want to know about, email us to supportatalloursenglish.com.</p>
<p>Let us know.</p>
<p>We can come back to this term.</p>
<p>But these are the big buckets here that we need to know about.</p>
<p>So what's the first one?</p>
<p>Well, the first one is about your brain, about your thoughts.</p>
<p>So someone's mind is their brain, but it can also be thoughts.</p>
<p>So for example, he has a very strong mind.</p>
<p>So that would be, you know, maybe he's very smart, or he is a big.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>or he is a big brain or something like that.</p>
<p>This is just all goes to your brain, really.</p>
<p>Or what's the next one?</p>
<p>I changed my mind.</p>
<p>Meaning you decided something different from what you had decided before, right?</p>
<p>You took a different path, okay?</p>
<p>Right, and the next one, this is in my mind.</p>
<p>So we were asking that question at the beginning.</p>
<p>I said, who, Lindsey said, who in your mind, right?</p>
<p>So it's like in your opinion.</p>
<p>So again, your thoughts.</p>
<p>And this is a really good conversation starter, right?</p>
<p>I hear this from a lot of people.</p>
<p>In my mind, it's better to eat oatmeal in the morning than cornflakes, right?</p>
<p>For example, anytime you want to express your opinion, this is a super native and natural.</p>
<p>So I think if our listeners take away anything, this could be a candidate to take away, to remember how to use this.</p>
<p>And then just as a fun bonus, we'll add the movie, A Beautiful Mind, right?</p>
<p>Oh, that's right.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Did you see it?</p>
<p>I, you know, I know I saw, I.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>you know, I know I saw I I saw I know there's there's a big twist.</p>
<p>Oh, it's a great movie.</p>
<p>The story.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's a big go ahead.</p>
<p>Yeah, I remember the twist.</p>
<p>I think I did see the whole thing, though.</p>
<p>Yeah, the story of john Nash, the Princeton professor, I don't know if it's a true story.</p>
<p>I think it might actually be a true story or based on a true story.</p>
<p>And he had schizophrenia, but he was also a genius professor, mathematician, I think, and check out the movie.</p>
<p>It's worth it.</p>
<p>It's just it's one of those words.</p>
<p>There's Oh, I love movies with a big twist like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know what I'm talking about?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Lindsay, what about changing your mind?</p>
<p>So do you would you say you've changed your mind about things frequently?</p>
<p>Oh, I think I'm usually pretty I usually take some time to consider which direction I want to go in when I have a choice.</p>
<p>And I usually don't. I try not to go back on that.</p>
<p>Because once I've decided there's a reason I've decided, right, and I try to stick with it and not change.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>And I try to stick with it and not change my mind.</p>
<p>What about you, Michelle?</p>
<p>Do you change your mind a lot?</p>
<p>Go back and forth?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Tons.</p>
<p>But once the decision is made, I don't think I go back on it that frequently, but I have a lot of buyer's remorse.</p>
<p>I mean, I'm always thinking, did I do the right thing?</p>
<p>But I don't necessarily change anything.</p>
<p>Buyer's remorse is just a fact of human psychology.</p>
<p>It's our brain kind of playing tricks on us, I think.</p>
<p>But yeah, we don't always have to listen to it.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yes, Love that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, yes.</p>
<p>Now, let's move on to the next bucket.</p>
<p>Oh, in... Yes, Now.</p>
<p>Yes, I was looking ahead.</p>
<p>So, the next one is really about caring or bothering.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Different.</p>
<p>So, this is where... Yes, This is different.</p>
<p>So, do you mind if I move this seat?</p>
<p>So, it's like, will this bother you?</p>
<p>Do you care?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So, in this case, we're using this as more of a verb, right?</p>
<p>It's no longer a noun of your...</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>It's no longer a noun of your brain, your mind.</p>
<p>It's a verb.</p>
<p>Yeah, To care or bother.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>Yeah, And what's another example?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't mind if you're a few minutes late, but the boss might.</p>
<p>Right, Yeah, Oh, not good.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Lindsay, does Kiefer ever have to go outside in the middle of the night?</p>
<p>Only if he's sick.</p>
<p>We've had a couple of just horrible scenarios where we were traveling and he had diarrhea and he had to go out like 10 times in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>And but that's only when he's having a problem.</p>
<p>So usually.</p>
<p>Yeah, So do you mind getting up in the middle of the night for that?</p>
<p>Oh, it's awful.</p>
<p>But I just I hate the idea of him, you know, whining and being uncomfortable.</p>
<p>You know, I hate that idea.</p>
<p>So, of course.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would rather get up and take him out.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>OK, Michelle, what else?</p>
<p>What else here?</p>
<p>OK, and the third one that we're going to focus on is this idea of being careful or.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>of being careful or taking care to do something.</p>
<p>So, this one makes me think of, you know, in London when they say, mind the gap.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, so famous.</p>
<p>So famous, right?</p>
<p>So when you, you know, it's about when you're getting on the tube and making sure that you don't fall into the little hole.</p>
<p>So they say.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's kind of fun that that really is more of a British way of using mind.</p>
<p>Yes, Meaning when the British people will use mind, meaning pay attention to, but we don't really use that that way in American English.</p>
<p>You would never hear the woman on the subway coming on the loudspeaker and saying, mind the gap.</p>
<p>No, she does.</p>
<p>She says other things.</p>
<p>Get off the train, stop holding the doors.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, it would not sound that proper.</p>
<p>It would also include a lot of four-letter words.</p>
<p>Yes, that's New York.</p>
<p>Maybe some expletives.</p>
<p>That's New York, right.</p>
<p>So, so it's important to point that out.</p>
<p>Yeah, pay attention to only is you, we only use mind in that context, really in British English, probably Australian </p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>in British English, probably Australian English.</p>
<p>Right, Or this really, like you probably heard of, mind your manners, that's similar.</p>
<p>We don't use that that much, but somebody I could see in certain situations, maybe in a class for, what is it called?</p>
<p>You know, when you're learning about manners.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, something like that, mind your manners.</p>
<p>Or, you know, a mother might say that if they're being, mind your manners.</p>
<p>And it's funny how in this phrase, mind your manners, mind also means, kind of means pay attention to in a sense, but we do in fact use this in American English because it's a chunk.</p>
<p>And it probably does come from, you know, because British roots, right?</p>
<p>But we do use this, but we don't use, oh, mind this, mind that, as non-chunks.</p>
<p>If that makes sense.</p>
<p>In American English.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree with you.</p>
<p>And the last one, this is also about being careful or taking care to do something.</p>
<p>This one is very common in my opinion.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Yeah, this one's kind of a combination of the.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>Yeah, this one's kind of a combination of the first bucket and the second and the third bucket in a way.</p>
<p>That's kind of cool.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>It's true.</p>
<p>Yeah, All these buckets.</p>
<p>Keep in mind.</p>
<p>So what does that mean, basically?</p>
<p>Just don't forget, make sure you pay special attention.</p>
<p>So it's paying attention is the third bucket and it's also keeping your head, keeping your brain the fact that the report is due at 12, not at one.</p>
<p>Keep that in your brain.</p>
<p>Yep, exactly.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the report is due at 12, not one.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So Lindsay, what do you think is important to keep in mind when learning a new language?</p>
<p>I think especially at the beginning levels, but at all levels, it's so important to get input, meaning listening exactly what our listeners are doing right now.</p>
<p>We want to make it part of our daily life, preferably part of our entertainment of our daily life, right?</p>
<p>Listen to a fun podcast, watch a YouTube channel, make it easy to consume and you don't have to understand every word.</p>
<p>That is okay.</p>
<p>But you get your, you're accustomed to hearing the sounds of English.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>hearing the sounds of English.</p>
<p>Yeah, love it.</p>
<p>Yep, so guys, keep that in mind when working on your English.</p>
<p>Lindsay, should we do a role play?</p>
<p>Let's do it, Michelle.</p>
<p>In this scenario, we are friends having lunch.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hey, Michelle, do you mind if we move to that table over there?</p>
<p>I'm a little cold.</p>
<p>Oh, no, that's fine.</p>
<p>I don't mind.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Actually, oh, that table's dirty.</p>
<p>Changed my mind.</p>
<p>Oh, that makes sense.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, they will probably clean it for us if we ask.</p>
<p>Okay, then let's move.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I'm really taking on a rollercoaster ride here.</p>
<p>Yes, I don't know.</p>
<p>I don't know where I'm gonna sit.</p>
<p>Yeah, Oh, gosh.</p>
<p>All right, so here you said, I said, hey, Michelle, do you mind if we move to that table over there?</p>
<p>I'm a little cold.</p>
<p>Right, Right, so this is that second bucket, right, to care, do you care, right?</p>
<p>Does it bother you?</p>
<p>And then I echoed that.</p>
<p>I said, I don't mind, so that doesn't bother me.</p>
<p>That's fine, fine, that's fine, yeah, yeah.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>That's fine.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, I don't mind.</p>
<p>And then I said, thanks.</p>
<p>Actually, that table's dirty.</p>
<p>Change my mind.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh, Lindsey.</p>
<p>You're driving me crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah, You're driving me crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah, And then I said, that makes sense.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that they'll probably clean it for us if we ask.</p>
<p>So keep in mind, that's a third bucket, right?</p>
<p>Being, well, third and, right, a little bit of a bucket mix here.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, remember, keep it in your head, right?</p>
<p>Remember, yeah.</p>
<p>It makes me think, one thing that when I do my meditation practice, one thing that we try to focus on is learning to live with a little discomfort and not constantly moving to accommodate the discomfort.</p>
<p>And this conversation reminds me of that.</p>
<p>We spend so much of our lives trying to make everything just perfect.</p>
<p>Everything has to be rearranged.</p>
<p>Everything has to be perfectly clean.</p>
<p>And it's a lot of wasted energy in a way.</p>
<p>If we could just sit at the table, it's a little dirty.</p>
<p>That might actually be okay, you know?</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>It's interesting.</p>
<p>Right, Right, Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>Yeah, And I think that that can change as you get older.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>For me, I guess to me, what it makes me think of is as a mom, I have to just kind of let a bunch of things go.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Yeah, The house, it's not going to be perfect.</p>
<p>Also, just something as simple as, you know, when you go for food and like we, you know, we went, I remember, so we went to Costco and they have the little eating area.</p>
<p>And it was so crazy, crazy with my kids.</p>
<p>And I normally I would have wiped down the table and everything.</p>
<p>And here, you know, you just, you can't, you just have to let some things go.</p>
<p>Yeah, So, you know, it's not perfect, but you know, you just have to, you're doing your best.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know that makes it, I'm sure that nothing teaches you that faster than being a mom.</p>
<p>A hundred percent.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>It's fine.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>our listeners are going to identify with that for sure.</p>
<p>Michelle, where should our listeners go to find another episode, a winning episode of All Ears English?</p>
<p>Okay, guys, head on over and listen to why you should not say, for your information.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Any final takeaway, anything our listeners... I love how we've broken down today's episode into three important buckets, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, So, guys, I mean, if I were you, I would focus on one, the one that feels most natural to you.</p>
<p>Start off with one.</p>
<p>Go out today and see if you can use one that you identify with the most.</p>
<p>And then another week, try another one.</p>
<p>So don't feel like you have to use all of these at the same time, right?</p>
<p>Just focus on one.</p>
<p>Let your brain separate it out because there are so many uses of this.</p>
<p>So because of that, we don't want to overwhelm ourselves.</p>
<p>Yeah, And I would say if I could recommend any, as I did at the top of the show, looking into how you can frequently use, in my mind, because this is a gateway...</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p>my mind because this is a gateway to a connection skill because what this leads to is you sharing your opinion and that leads to connection because that helps people know you better.</p>
<p>So if you're going to take away any one phrase, take away that one and get comfortable sharing your opinion and asking others for their opinions on anything in life, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, Exactly.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, thank you so much, Lindsay.</p>
