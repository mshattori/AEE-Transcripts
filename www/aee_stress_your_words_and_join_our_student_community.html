<p id="p-17">Hello, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-18">How's it going today? Um Good.</p>
<p id="p-19">How are you, Michelle? Everything.</p>
<p id="p-20">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-21">Over there.</p>
<p id="p-22">Knock, knock.</p>
<p id="p-23">Yes, everything's fine.</p>
<p id="p-24">I'm actually kind of bored already talking to you.</p>
<p id="p-25">So I'm just going to hang up the phone now.</p>
<p id="p-26">All right, goodbye.</p>
<p id="p-27">That was a great episode.</p>
<p id="p-28">No, guys, Lindsay, would you say that as podcasters, we really have to use a lot of emotion or feeling in our voice? Of course, 100% because that's how we're connecting with our listeners.</p>
<p id="p-29">And that's also how we're teaching our listeners.</p>
<p id="p-30">English is with emotion with emphasis.</p>
<p id="p-31">So how did I just sound to you when I started really boring.</p>
<p id="p-32">Engaging? Actually, you sounded kind of tired to me.</p>
<p id="p-33">Did you not sleep? Well, I didn't but I still, um, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-34">So, uh today we're gonna talk about a really useful way to sound more interesting and to be understood.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-35">To be understood in an easier way.</p>
<p id="p-36">So the trick that we're talking about today, this deals with word stress.</p>
<p id="p-37">Um And, you know, when I, the word I would use to describe how I was speaking was.</p>
<p id="p-38">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-39">Boring.</p>
<p id="p-40">Also that word monotonous.</p>
<p id="p-41">What does that, what does that mean? It means repetitive.</p>
<p id="p-42">So, monotonous is something that's the same all the time if you break it down mono, right? Which is one and tone, right? So one tone.</p>
<p id="p-43">So not very, not many variations.</p>
<p id="p-44">We've talked about it a little bit on the show before, but not many variations or it's, and, and especially I think in English it's very important.</p>
<p id="p-45">Not in all languages, not all languages have this, um this way of using stress.</p>
<p id="p-46">And so Lindsay, why is it a problem to be?</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-47">Why is it a problem to be monotonous when speaking English? I think we just put so much emphasis on verbal expression, especially in American culture all about what you say.</p>
<p id="p-48">Uh Unfortunately, I disagree with this but it's not always about how well you listen, although you should listen.</p>
<p id="p-49">Well, we uh you know, I think misguidedly we place more emphasis on verbal expression what you say.</p>
<p id="p-50">And so, well, number one for people to really understand you because we're not going to become perfect at pronunciation as adult learners.</p>
<p id="p-51">It's just not gonna happen, right.</p>
<p id="p-52">There's always gonna be, I think there's always going to be a slight detection of an accent.</p>
<p id="p-53">It's just, it's the reality.</p>
<p id="p-54">We're learning a language as an adult and that's totally OK, And people love that actually, as long as you can deliver clearly and they can understand you.</p>
<p id="p-55">So that's where breaking up the monotony comes in the monotone.</p>
<p id="p-56">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-57">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-58">Guys, this is huge.</p>
<p id="p-59">So this is</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-60">So this is word stress.</p>
<p id="p-61">It's, it's not only about this feeling of sounding fun, it's not just that it also can actually make words sound different, it can make the meaning different.</p>
<p id="p-62">Everything can change.</p>
<p id="p-63">So that's why it's important to use this as a strategy to make sure that you are understood.</p>
<p id="p-64">So Lindsay, when we stress a word, what do we do? What do, what does that even mean? What are we doing to the word? I think to stress, a word means to emphasize it to either say it a little louder, maybe slower.</p>
<p id="p-65">It means you're saying this is the most important word I'm going to say now.</p>
<p id="p-66">Right, Exactly what I want you to hear.</p>
<p id="p-67">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-68">So I'm just gonna say the teeny tiny sentence and you tell me which word I'm stressing just to give an idea of what stress sounds like.</p>
<p id="p-69">So here we go.</p>
<p id="p-70">It's easy.</p>
<p id="p-71">Sounds like you're stressing easy.</p>
<p id="p-72">But I say if I say</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-73">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-74">If I say it's easy.</p>
<p id="p-75">Yeah, you're stressing the, its so sounds a little odd.</p>
<p id="p-76">It sounds a little odd because I don't know what you're saying.</p>
<p id="p-77">But clearly you could be saying two very different things if we extend the conversation here, put it into context.</p>
<p id="p-78">Right, Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-79">So, but the idea is that we stress the most important words.</p>
<p id="p-80">So when we think about, OK, how, how are we gonna choose now? It's, it can always be different because that's the thing is there's a, it's, it's really an art.</p>
<p id="p-81">Um You again, we've talked about so much on the show, learning the learning the basics and getting that down and then changing things up.</p>
<p id="p-82">So it can be based on so many different things, your, your mood, what you're trying to emphasize things like that.</p>
<p id="p-83">But the basic thing that we wanna stress is the most important word.</p>
<p id="p-84">So this can be multiple words in a sentence.</p>
<p id="p-85">And um we, it's these information.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-86">We, it's these information words.</p>
<p id="p-87">So what would you call like an information word? Lindsay, what would I call an information word? OK, Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-88">So it tends to be nouns, verbs, adjectives.</p>
<p id="p-89">Uh the key words that carry, carry the information Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-90">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-91">So you're not necessarily going to be stressing, you know, on a pre prepositions, things like that.</p>
<p id="p-92">I, I would say unless you're trying to say something different, like let's take this first example here, right? So Lindsay lives in Denver, right? So they just, if you're just objectively saying that and saying nothing more than that, we're stressing Lindsay lives Denver.</p>
<p id="p-93">But what if you and I are thinking, doesn't she live in the suburbs? Doesn't she live outside the city? No, no, no, she lives in Denver.</p>
<p id="p-94">Right? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-95">She lives in Denver.</p>
<p id="p-96">So sometimes we do stress those propositions.</p>
<p id="p-97">It just depends on what we're saying and we're saying something totally different.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-98">You're saying something totally different.</p>
<p id="p-99">It's so true.</p>
<p id="p-100">So this is, this is really high level stuff guys, but you guys are ready for it.</p>
<p id="p-101">I know that and this will help you get to the next level.</p>
<p id="p-102">Well, this is, I was gonna say Michelle, this is really what does get us, you know, pass that into the B two level.</p>
<p id="p-103">We find this at that B two level and in just a minute after we give you guys a little more information, we're gonna talk about our live, what's going on this week? A special offer on our B two course where we're gonna go deeper into this.</p>
<p id="p-104">But Michelle, what would be another example here? OK, All right.</p>
<p id="p-105">So I need to buy a cake for the party.</p>
<p id="p-106">So I need to buy a cake for the party.</p>
<p id="p-107">So I need buy cake party.</p>
<p id="p-108">It's almost if you wanted to, if you took out every other party, if you took out the two for the even I and you just said need buy cake party.</p>
<p id="p-109">Yeah, you would sound like a caveman but</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-110">It sound like a caveman but I was gonna say caveman in English.</p>
<p id="p-111">Yes, Yes, But it could still, that is the important stuff you could get what I'm trying to say.</p>
<p id="p-112">So that's a little we're not recommending you talk like that.</p>
<p id="p-113">But when you think about what to stress, that's usually gonna do it if you can still understand that sentence.</p>
<p id="p-114">Right, Yeah, I was just gonna say I have a family member.</p>
<p id="p-115">Unfortunately, that texts in caveman English, it's really funny.</p>
<p id="p-116">I don't know what happened or how this person didn't get the memo that it's OK to write out prepositions in text messages.</p>
<p id="p-117">That's funny.</p>
<p id="p-118">It's hilarious.</p>
<p id="p-119">We'll come back to that another day.</p>
<p id="p-120">Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-121">We're two now.</p>
<p id="p-122">We're two now.</p>
<p id="p-123">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-124">So again, just quickly, you know, how would this sound without the stress? I mean, so uh it would just be Lindsay lives in Denver, right? It would all be robotic.</p>
<p id="p-125">Sounds like a I actually, it sounds a little bit like Alexa.</p>
<p id="p-126">Um My Alexa.</p>
<p id="p-127">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-128">Right, So, I mean, again, this is</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-129">Right, So, I mean, again, this is something that we go over extensively in our B course.</p>
<p id="p-130">I mean, Lindsay, sorry B come on, Michelle B two course.</p>
<p id="p-131">OK, Lindsay, tell us more about this course and you know, the, the some of the most exciting or the biggest benefits of it.</p>
<p id="p-132">I mean, this is a brand new course.</p>
<p id="p-133">And when we introduced it last spring, we had an incredible response because this is what you guys need.</p>
<p id="p-134">The majority of you guys are at this B one B two level and it represents challenging yourself, pushing yourself to see if you can actually get beyond B two, approaching C one.</p>
<p id="p-135">So it's an opportunity and what's cool about all of our courses now and it also is included in the B two course is how many opportunities you now have to speak.</p>
<p id="p-136">We have fluency parties, open conversation club, Q and A.</p>
<p id="p-137">If you join the personal coach level, you have a robot, we have a robust community where people are connected.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-138">A robust community where people are connecting with each other, arranging their own speaking opportunities.</p>
<p id="p-139">Michelle, what do you think about this transformation we've made with our courses with all the speaking we're doing now? Oh, well, it's huge.</p>
<p id="p-140">I mean, it's so interactive now.</p>
<p id="p-141">Um I've been on open conversation.</p>
<p id="p-142">I, I'll sometimes pop into them.</p>
<p id="p-143">And so yeah, and it's so fun because, you know, we having a really good conversation, then people might get into groups as the whole group, so, so many different ways to interact and then you can even meet people who are taking the course as well.</p>
<p id="p-144">So there's just, it's just kind of endless opportunities.</p>
<p id="p-145">It's really what you make of it and we really give you as many chances as possible to really get that speaking and that feedback one 100%.</p>
<p id="p-146">And then we keep the rooms open at the end.</p>
<p id="p-147">So you can stay longer if you want to stay and talk with someone else who also has time for two hours, you can do that.</p>
<p id="p-148">So tons of practice opportunities.</p>
<p id="p-149">And now we want to let you know about the offer.</p>
<p id="p-150">That's all</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-151">We want to let you know about the offer that's only available this week.</p>
<p id="p-152">We only make this offer available a few times a year.</p>
<p id="p-153">And again, it's a brand new course.</p>
<p id="p-154">So we recommend you join now.</p>
<p id="p-155">So what is the offer Michelle that we're offering this week only? Ok.</p>
<p id="p-156">So this is great.</p>

<p id="p-160">Yeah, and that bonus is a $49 value.</p>
<p id="p-161">So you're saving up to 100 and $49 depending on which plan you choose.</p>
<p id="p-162">So guys, the only thing you need to know though is that this offer does end on September 22nd at midnight us time.</p>

<p id="p-166">Now.</p>
<p id="p-167">We want to meet you at an open</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-168">Now we want to meet you at an open conversation club or a fluency party.</p>
<p id="p-169">I'm loving, meeting our students.</p>
<p id="p-170">See them put things into action that they're learning in the course.</p>
<p id="p-171">It is really great.</p>
<p id="p-172">It's great.</p>
<p id="p-173">All right.</p>
<p id="p-174">Now, let's do.</p>
<p id="p-175">Should we do a role play? What do you think? Let's go for it.</p>
<p id="p-176">So, um here Lindsay and I, we are neighbors planning a block party.</p>
<p id="p-177">Yes, All right.</p>
<p id="p-178">Great.</p>
<p id="p-179">Right, Ok.</p>
<p id="p-180">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-181">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-182">I ordered seven pizzas.</p>
<p id="p-183">Thanks.</p>
<p id="p-184">I need to order the dessert.</p>
<p id="p-185">The cake.</p>
<p id="p-186">Yes, And the pie.</p>
<p id="p-187">Oh, sounds delicious.</p>
<p id="p-188">Which would you rather have cake or pie? Michelle? Are you a cake person? Pie person? I know you're a cookies person.</p>
<p id="p-189">Don't say cookies, don't say cookies.</p>
<p id="p-190">I won't say ice cream.</p>
<p id="p-191">I won't say ok, bye.</p>
<p id="p-192">Um cake is more frequent when, but I, when it, when there's, I recently went to a party and there was a peach pie and when I tell you that I was excited, it was, it's an understatement.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-193">It was, it's an under peach is like my favorite fruit because it is so good in August.</p>
<p id="p-194">It's so good.</p>
<p id="p-195">So I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-196">I'm gonna go pie.</p>
<p id="p-197">What about you? I wanna do pie too at our wedding.</p>
<p id="p-198">We did pie instead of cake and it was like, oh, that's, I love that.</p>
<p id="p-199">What kind of pie we did? Strawberry rhubarb.</p>
<p id="p-200">I think we had a, I actually had a cherry pie which by the way, if it's made, well, it can be really good.</p>
<p id="p-201">It's very commonplace.</p>
<p id="p-202">Cherry pie, like the cheap things in the store, but it was a good, good cherry pie.</p>
<p id="p-203">A good cherry pie is killer, killer.</p>
<p id="p-204">So I love how that we tossed our talking about pie, cherry pie and the B Two Floy course.</p>
<p id="p-205">All right, Michelle, let's, let's go into what we did here with our intonation because it matters so that we could be understood.</p>
<p id="p-206">And again, in the B Two Floy course there's an entire lesson or a few lessons where we go deeper into this, right, Michelle? All right.</p>
<p id="p-207">So here we go.</p>
<p id="p-208">I said, OK, I ordered seven pizzas and really, I'm stressed.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-209">And really, I'm stressing all of those words.</p>
<p id="p-210">Right, Ordered seven pizzas, right? I ordered seven pizzas.</p>
<p id="p-211">Right, And again, if I said, did you order five pizzas? No, I ordered seven pizzas pizza.</p>
<p id="p-212">Then we, we're having a little bit of a different conversation.</p>
<p id="p-213">Right? And then I said, thanks.</p>
<p id="p-214">I need to order the dessert.</p>
<p id="p-215">So each need, each of these words need order dessert.</p>
<p id="p-216">We're all stressed and it's really spacing out your words nicely too.</p>
<p id="p-217">Yes, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-218">And then I said the cake.</p>
<p id="p-219">So cake is certainly the most important word.</p>
<p id="p-220">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-221">Making sure it's cake that you're getting.</p>
<p id="p-222">Yes, And the pie.</p>
<p id="p-223">Um, I might also, in this case, depending on how I want to say it.</p>
<p id="p-224">You might stress and, and as well as pie and the pie, don't forget the pie.</p>
<p id="p-225">Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-226">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-227">So again, this is, you know, we gave you some basic rules but there's so much to play with here.</p>
<p id="p-228">Um, so definitely, definitely when you are in.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-229">Definitely, definitely when you are in one of our open conversation clubs, getting that speaking practice, that's something you can really try and practice as well.</p>
<p id="p-230">And using the connection method which we use in all of our courses, you're actually going to learn from interviews with real native speakers.</p>
<p id="p-231">That's what our courses have.</p>
<p id="p-232">So you're gonna see how native speakers do this, right? In our conversations.</p>
<p id="p-233">That is your learning material in the B two fluency course.</p>
<p id="p-234">Super cool.</p>
<p id="p-235">Right, And then I said, oh, it sounds delicious.</p>
<p id="p-236">So delicious is definitely important.</p>
<p id="p-237">You could say it.</p>
<p id="p-238">I mean, sounds is also.</p>
<p id="p-239">So um again, a lot to play with here.</p>
<p id="p-240">I mean, the takeaway for today is, it's, it's not always cut and dry as far as the rules go, but we gave you some basics, just avoid being monotonous and try and think about what words am I stressing, try and really think about those content words um as, as much as you can and give, give that a practice and you'll notice that you get, you'll get a good response from that.</p>
<p id="p-241">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-242">And I think a good way to practice too.</p>
<p id="p-243">Uh</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-244">A good way to practice too.</p>
<p id="p-245">Um Beyond the course, the course is your first step.</p>
<p id="p-246">But then you could also go and look at speeches.</p>
<p id="p-247">Now, speech language is gonna be a little different.</p>
<p id="p-248">It's gonna be a little more intentional.</p>
<p id="p-249">When someone's on a stage, they're gonna punch certain words a bit more.</p>
<p id="p-250">Uh You don't want to be that person that goes to a party and acts like they're on stage.</p>
<p id="p-251">But, but it's interesting as you're exaggerating when you're first learning to see what is emphasized and why and just to understand how powerful that could be when you need to do it.</p>
<p id="p-252">OK, guys remember to uh head on over to all ears English dot com slash B two to get this amazing offer.</p>
<p id="p-253">And this ends at September on September 22nd at midnight is going back up.</p>
