<p id="p-19">Hey there, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-20">How's it going today?</p>
<p id="p-21">Good, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-22">Lindsay, can you do any impressions of people, maybe a celebrity or anything like that?</p>
<p id="p-23">Not very well.</p>
<p id="p-24">I usually have to hear their voice immediately, and they have to...</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-25">to hear their voice immediately and they have to have a very distinctive voice or accent.</p>
<p id="p-26">I'm good at mimicking accents right after I hear them, but I'm not very good at, you know, just out of the blue doing someone.</p>
<p id="p-27">Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p id="p-28">Without calling it up and hearing and listening to it.</p>
<p id="p-29">So that's my quirk.</p>
<p id="p-30">What about you, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-31">I would imagine you're pretty good at it.</p>
<p id="p-32">Well, I used to do this game with my brother when I was younger, maybe 10 or in my teenage years and he would play the piano and I would sing and he would call out a celebrity, a singer, and we'd be doing the same song and I would always switch and try and do impressions of that singer singing the same song.</p>
<p id="p-33">So we use it.</p>
<p id="p-34">I don't know if I'm good at it.</p>
<p id="p-35">My brother thought I was, but I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-36">But I haven't really done that in a long time.</p>
<p id="p-37">But so today we're actually going to talk about the differences between the words mock and mimic.</p>
<p id="p-38">So, Lindsay, you mentioned the word mimic.</p>
<p id="p-39">Yes, Mm hmm.</p>
<p id="p-40">Yeah, So this is.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-41">Yes, Yeah, So this is this is going to be a good one.</p>
<p id="p-42">I'm excited for this episode.</p>
<p id="p-43">But before we get into that, we have some reviewers that we really want to thank.</p>
<p id="p-44">Yeah, guys.</p>
<p id="p-45">Reviews are huge for us.</p>
<p id="p-46">It is so important for us to know what you think about the show.</p>
<p id="p-47">So go and leave a review anywhere you listen.</p>
<p id="p-48">Also in the app, the Android or iOS is also a great place to leave a review, as well as the podcast.</p>
<p id="p-49">I want to call out two reviewers.</p>
<p id="p-50">We have a five star review.</p>
<p id="p-51">The name is anonymous, so the person didn't want to leave their name, but they reviewed us on November 3rd.</p>
<p id="p-52">So special thank you to that person.</p>
<p id="p-53">And Jian Zhang also left a five star review on November 1st.</p>
<p id="p-54">So that is amazing, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-55">And guys, we will call your name aloud on the show if you leave a review.</p>
<p id="p-56">So go ahead and leave that review.</p>
<p id="p-57">Yeah, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-58">Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-59">Please do.</p>
<p id="p-60">We love hearing from you.</p>
<p id="p-61">Thank you so much.</p>
<p id="p-62">Yeah, All right.</p>
<p id="p-63">Where do we go here with mock and mimic?</p>
<p id="p-64">Important.</p>
<p id="p-65">It sounds like they could be the same.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-66">It's important, you know, it sounds like they could be the same thing, but they're really not.</p>
<p id="p-67">Right, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-68">Yeah, No, they're not.</p>
<p id="p-69">Well, so let's get into it.</p>
<p id="p-70">So they are, we're going to be talking about both of them as verbs today.</p>
<p id="p-71">So we have mock.</p>
<p id="p-72">To me, when you hear mock, it's a little bit more potentially mean spirited, more about teasing someone.</p>
<p id="p-73">So maybe, again, they're similar in the way that it's both kind of copying or trying to impersonate in some way.</p>
<p id="p-74">So in that way, they're similar.</p>
<p id="p-75">But to me, mock sounds a little bit more mean spirited.</p>
<p id="p-76">So for example, if you said, Sarah hated it when people mocked her voice.</p>
<p id="p-77">Yeah, essentially, it means, it really means teasing.</p>
<p id="p-78">It's a way of teasing someone, right?</p>
<p id="p-79">But it's a special, it doesn't mean teasing.</p>
<p id="p-80">It's a kind of teasing is what I mean by that.</p>
<p id="p-81">Right, Yeah, And right.</p>
<p id="p-82">It's exactly and it doesn't have to be that they're doing an impression of her voice.</p>
<p id="p-83">But at me, but likely they're kind of doing.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-84">but likely they're kind of doing some sort of impression, but it could just be, oh, they mocked it, they talked about it, they made fun of it.</p>
<p id="p-85">So it has that use as well.</p>
<p id="p-86">Oh, that's a really, this is kind of high level, actually, when you think about it, because people do use mocking in a way when someone says, are you mocking me, right?</p>
<p id="p-87">When you're maybe using sarcasm to respond to what someone said.</p>
<p id="p-88">It's not just, let me do an impression of you in a way that's teasing or degrading to you.</p>
<p id="p-89">It's not that simple, right?</p>
<p id="p-90">Right, Do you remember in, you've seen My Cousin Vinny, right?</p>
<p id="p-91">Yeah, I love that movie.</p>
<p id="p-92">Do you remember when he comes in the ridiculous suit?</p>
<p id="p-93">Do you remember that scene?</p>
<p id="p-94">And the judge says, are you mocking me?</p>
<p id="p-95">Yeah, I have to watch that movie again, honestly.</p>
<p id="p-96">Yeah, oh, it's so funny.</p>
<p id="p-97">This might be the right time for a good funny movie.</p>
<p id="p-98">I could watch that now.</p>
<p id="p-99">But yeah, basically, just to give a little bit of background.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-100">Just to give a little bit of background, so because I think it's helpful.</p>
<p id="p-101">So this judge, so this guy, Vinnie, he's coming in to be a lawyer, but he has kind of this wild personality and he's not a very good lawyer.</p>
<p id="p-102">He doesn't really know much, but so he's trying.</p>
<p id="p-103">And so the judge keeps on getting him in trouble because he's wearing inappropriate clothes to be a lawyer in the courtroom.</p>
<p id="p-104">So then he tries to get a suit, but his suit gets covered in mud somehow and he can't find a new suit.</p>
<p id="p-105">So he just finds this red tuxedo and it's very over the top.</p>
<p id="p-106">And he goes into the courtroom and the judge looks at him and he says, are you mocking me?</p>
<p id="p-107">That's perfect.</p>
<p id="p-108">Yeah, So that's an example of he wasn't actually saying anything.</p>
<p id="p-109">He wasn't doing an impression of him, but it was that he was doing something in this sarcastic way to tease him, even though he actually wasn't trying to.</p>
<p id="p-110">Yeah, that's a great example.</p>
<p id="p-111">So mocking actually is quite a high level term.</p>
<p id="p-112">How to know</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-113">high-level term, how to know when to use it, when it goes beyond just the actions that someone is taking, right?</p>
<p id="p-114">So that is definitely for the advanced level here as our listeners move up into that C1 level.</p>
<p id="p-115">All right, should we flip over then to mimic, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-116">Yes, let's do it.</p>
<p id="p-117">How is this different?</p>
<p id="p-118">Right, so mimic is really imitating someone.</p>
<p id="p-119">I suppose you could wear clothes to mimic someone.</p>
<p id="p-120">But to me, when I hear mimic, I think more of actually doing an impression.</p>
<p id="p-121">It doesn't mean that it's mean-spirited, whereas mock is definitely mean-spirited.</p>
<p id="p-122">Yes, completely.</p>
<p id="p-123">So for example, here's a couple of sample sentences for our listeners, guys.</p>
<p id="p-124">Her daughter mimicked her every move.</p>
<p id="p-125">Now, this is interesting because this doesn't mean her daughter is verbally mimicking her.</p>
<p id="p-126">It means she's physically doing the same thing.</p>
<p id="p-127">But it's not about what she's saying.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-128">But it's not about what she's saying.</p>
<p id="p-129">It's about what she's doing, right?</p>
<p id="p-130">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-131">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-132">Yeah, right.</p>
<p id="p-133">Yeah, a lot of times kids will mimic their parents in their actions or in their words.</p>
<p id="p-134">Yes, I definitely sometimes you don't realize it until you hear your kids say something.</p>
<p id="p-135">And then you're like, Oh, that's from me.</p>
<p id="p-136">That's me.</p>
<p id="p-137">The funniest thing.</p>
<p id="p-138">So my nephew, my partner's nephew, my nephew, we were camping this summer.</p>
<p id="p-139">Okay, this is a this is a two like a three year old child.</p>
<p id="p-140">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-141">So we're camping.</p>
<p id="p-142">He's got a little bit of an attitude.</p>
<p id="p-143">He's you know, he's his own person.</p>
<p id="p-144">But wait, sorry, how old again?</p>
<p id="p-145">He's like three years old.</p>
<p id="p-146">He's young, young, young, young.</p>
<p id="p-147">He doesn't have vocabulary yet.</p>
<p id="p-148">Very good vocabulary yet.</p>
<p id="p-149">And we're throwing around the ball and all of a sudden he gets upset and he stands there and we're all outside by our tents and he stands there crosses his arms and he goes, When did this come up?</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-150">this come up?</p>
<p id="p-151">Right?</p>
<p id="p-152">So clearly, he doesn't know what he's saying.</p>
<p id="p-153">What does that mean when someone says, when did this come up?</p>
<p id="p-154">When did this come up?</p>
<p id="p-155">I'm like, you're asking for, I don't even know, like the story about something?</p>
<p id="p-156">Yeah, Basically, he's mimicking his mom.</p>
<p id="p-157">He's taking it totally out of context.</p>
<p id="p-158">He doesn't know the context.</p>
<p id="p-159">Usually when someone says, when did this come up?</p>
<p id="p-160">It's like, when did someone talk about this?</p>
<p id="p-161">When did this topic arise in the conversation?</p>
<p id="p-162">Right?</p>
<p id="p-163">But we're just throwing around a ball and he's getting upset and he only knows that his mom said that and maybe she was upset at some point or something.</p>
<p id="p-164">Right?</p>
<p id="p-165">So he brought it totally out of context, but he's mimicking his mom or his dad.</p>
<p id="p-166">And it was so funny because it just made no sense for the scenario that we were in.</p>
<p id="p-167">So I love it.</p>
<p id="p-168">Those are the funniest things.</p>
<p id="p-169">Well, the scary thing is if they ever curse and yeah.</p>
<p id="p-170">Oh, sure.</p>
<p id="p-171">That's the worst kind of mimicking.</p>
<p id="p-172">Yeah, that's definitely</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-173">mimicking yeah yeah that's definitely happened to me with because my husband dan tends to if somebody falls he he's very bad about not cursing and so and there was one time when my daughter just started saying a certain word and um yeah so that's when you're like oh i better stop it that is the ultimate definition of mimic at the lowest level right at the most basic level it's what kids do before they have the context for things and they're just mimicking their parents right yep um that's a great example of mimic and then of course as you said it can you mimic you know uh j-lo or can you mimic this celebrity that celebrity sure we do that too actors celebrity singers elvis so right yeah right oh yeah and elvis impersonator oh my gosh so fun vegas yeah um so yeah another thing you could say is she practiced mimicking celebrities for the school talent show so</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-174">the school talent show.</p>
<p id="p-175">So basically mocking may be mimicking someone, but it's a bit mean-spirited.</p>
<p id="p-176">Mimicking, it's tough to say that, may be more just a little bit neutral.</p>
<p id="p-177">Doing something funny, doing an impression.</p>
<p id="p-178">Yes, I totally agree.</p>
<p id="p-179">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-180">It's important to notice the difference.</p>
<p id="p-181">All right.</p>
<p id="p-182">So what about the expression imitation is the highest form of flattery, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-183">What do we think about that?</p>
<p id="p-184">Have you heard that expression?</p>
<p id="p-185">Oh, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-186">Oh, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-187">I always like that one.</p>
<p id="p-188">I think it reminds me of, have you ever shown up somewhere or heard about people showing up somewhere and they're wearing the same outfit?</p>
<p id="p-189">Yeah, Sometimes, like they took your style or something.</p>
<p id="p-190">Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-191">I mean, so sometimes people can get upset if somebody, they feel that somebody copied their style or something like that, but then you have to say, oh, well.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-192">But then you have to say, oh, well imitation is the highest form of flattery.</p>
<p id="p-193">What does that mean?</p>
<p id="p-194">It just means that they see what you do Maybe how you dress or how you speak and they want to be like you right and kids will do this, too Maybe they'll play certain games Maybe a good example of that could be if a kid's dad or mom is a nurse or a doctor And they want to play that game at home with their sibling all the time, right?</p>
<p id="p-195">Very good example.</p>
<p id="p-196">Mm-hmm for sure Yes, Yes, and actually I I one of my favorite people to imitate in the whole world is my dad um, I he's my favorite person in the world to do an impression of but it's all in good fun and I do it in Front of him and everybody in my family just cracks up when I do it.</p>
<p id="p-197">It's just my sometimes I'll just break out into being my dad and Sometimes I'll say to him.</p>
<p id="p-198">Oh, you know imitation is the highest form of flattery.</p>
<p id="p-199">It's all in good fun.</p>
<p id="p-200">He laughs It's just a lot of fun so that's like if I could imitate one person it's my dad Oh, that's and that makes me actually think of SNL</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-201">And that makes me actually think of SNL, right?</p>
<p id="p-202">Because SNL, I mean, we just had our elections and maybe this will go away, but for the last year or so, there's been a Kamala impersonator, right?</p>
<p id="p-203">What's her name?</p>
<p id="p-204">Maya Rudolph.</p>
<p id="p-205">Maya Rudolph.</p>
<p id="p-206">And that's what they do during election seasons on SNL is they're on there all the time mimicking.</p>
<p id="p-207">And it is really, really funny.</p>
<p id="p-208">I mean, they come up with the quirkiest parts.</p>
<p id="p-209">I think for a while, who was it?</p>
<p id="p-210">The Baldwin, one of the Baldwins was Donald Trump.</p>
<p id="p-211">Baldwin was Trump, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-212">Yes, it's just, I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-213">That's another example of mimicking people, right?</p>
<p id="p-214">Oh yeah, that's huge.</p>
<p id="p-215">I mean, people love when they can hear celebrity impersonations.</p>
<p id="p-216">I think it's just so much fun.</p>
<p id="p-217">Exactly, and if you guys aren't sure what we're talking about by SNL, it's Saturday Night Live, which is one of the most famous TV shows in American culture.</p>
<p id="p-218">I'm not sure if it streams globally.</p>
<p id="p-219">I don't actually know, but check it out if you have access to it for sure, right?</p>
<p id="p-220">Okay, so yeah, I think after the break, we're gonna do some other.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-221">I think after the break, we're going to do some other words that go along with this topic.</p>
<p id="p-222">Sounds good, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-223">See you in a few minutes.</p>
<p id="p-224">Do you need a new PC?</p>
<p id="p-225">I'm sure not everyone does.</p>
<p id="p-226">But if you want to make music, record animal movements in the wilderness, or draw your own vision, Co-Pilot Plus PC will give you the power to make a real difference.</p>
<p id="p-227">To you who will change tomorrow.</p>
<p id="p-228">Co-Pilot Plus PC with Snapdragon.</p>
<p id="p-229">The fastest and most high-performance Windows PC ever.</p>
<p id="p-230">Alright, not a few minutes, we're back in a few seconds here.</p>
<p id="p-231">Here we are.</p>
<p id="p-232">Alright, so there's a few other words that go into these buckets here that we need to address because they do come up when we talk about different topics.</p>
<p id="p-233">What's the first one, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-234">It's to copy, right?</p>
<p id="p-235">But a lot of times people say copycat.</p>
<p id="p-236">So it's a similar idea.</p>
<p id="p-237">Usually copycat is...</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-238">similar idea.</p>
<p id="p-239">Usually copycat is more negative.</p>
<p id="p-240">So if you just say, Oh, my sister copies everything I do, it can be frustrating.</p>
<p id="p-241">Okay, so that's a negative spin.</p>
<p id="p-242">But especially if you know, a kid might call another kid like you're a copycat, you're a copycat.</p>
<p id="p-243">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-244">That's where it's used the most.</p>
<p id="p-245">It's also used unfortunately, when it comes when there's a crime, like when there's a sometimes shooting, you might be on alert for copycat shooters does sometimes happen.</p>
<p id="p-246">So that's another place where we use it.</p>
<p id="p-247">We just want to show you guys all the broad places in society where we do use these terms.</p>
<p id="p-248">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-249">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-250">What's the next one, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-251">All right, parrot.</p>
<p id="p-252">I like this one.</p>
<p id="p-253">It comes back to like, just what parrots do, right?</p>
<p id="p-254">Right, Yeah, Yeah, She just parrots what her friends say, and she needs to think for herself.</p>
<p id="p-255">So yeah, parrots are the ones that can that can speak right?</p>
<p id="p-256">The birds?</p>
<p id="p-257">Do you?</p>
<p id="p-258">Have you ever interacted with a parrot that like get it?</p>
<p id="p-259">Have you ever been mimicked by a parrot?</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-260">mimicked by a parrot?</p>
<p id="p-261">No, but I have seen parrots.</p>
<p id="p-262">But no, I haven't had that happen to me.</p>
<p id="p-263">What about you?</p>
<p id="p-264">I don't think I have.</p>
<p id="p-265">But definitely, when I'm in the presence of a parrot, I'm like, oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-266">But watch what you say.</p>
<p id="p-267">Is this bird going to make fun of me now?</p>
<p id="p-268">You know what I mean?</p>
<p id="p-269">It feels weird.</p>
<p id="p-270">It feels weird.</p>
<p id="p-271">Yeah, no, it's true.</p>
<p id="p-272">It's true.</p>
<p id="p-273">So you might say, she, oh, wait, did you already say the example?</p>
<p id="p-274">Yeah, I'll say it again, though, just to solidify for our listeners.</p>
<p id="p-275">Because in this case, we talked about a parrot as a noun, an animal, a bird.</p>
<p id="p-276">But this is used as a verb, right?</p>
<p id="p-277">So we just take that noun, and we turn it into a verb.</p>
<p id="p-278">She just parrots what her friends say, and she needs to think for herself.</p>
<p id="p-279">And of course, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-280">I think it is mostly a negative.</p>
<p id="p-281">When you say somebody parrots someone, I think it's more like, oh, that they're not thinking for themselves, or they're just going with what the other person says.</p>
<p id="p-282">So to me, that one is usually more negative.</p>
<p id="p-283">Right,</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-284">usually more negative.</p>
<p id="p-285">Right, and then in society we see this where if you say, certain people will parrot what they hear on the news or maybe on podcasts or on certain channels, that sort of thing, or what they read, right?</p>
<p id="p-286">So you might see that when you're having broader conversations in society, okay?</p>
<p id="p-287">Good.</p>
<p id="p-288">What else, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-289">The last one we'll do is impersonate.</p>
<p id="p-290">So that's also a similar idea, and this goes a lot with those, with an actual vocal impersonation, I think.</p>
<p id="p-291">Tom does the best impersonation of Jimmy Fallon.</p>
<p id="p-292">And we're gonna bring in Jimmy Fallon.</p>
<p id="p-293">I haven't really heard that many of Jimmy Fallon's impersonations, actually.</p>
<p id="p-294">Yeah, no, he does some pretty good ones.</p>
<p id="p-295">So Jimmy Fallon also, yeah, as Lindsay mentioned, SNL stars.</p>
<p id="p-296">There's this new comedian, Matt Friend.</p>
<p id="p-297">He does a lot of good celebrity impersonations.</p>
<p id="p-298">And then, you know, Dana Carvey is the one who did, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-299">He did Biden.</p>
<p id="p-300">Oh, he did Biden.</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p id="p-301">Yeah, he did Biden.</p>
<p id="p-302">Oh, he did Biden.</p>
<p id="p-303">Okay, okay, all right.</p>
<p id="p-304">Yeah, I didn't see him doing Biden, but that's interesting.</p>
<p id="p-305">He did it on the most recent ones, on the most recent episodes, it's Dana Carvey.</p>
<p id="p-306">Are you an SNL fan?</p>
<p id="p-307">Do you watch it all the time?</p>
<p id="p-308">Okay, I skip around.</p>
<p id="p-309">I usually watch the beginning and then, especially the best time to watch SNL is when there's an election, right?</p>
<p id="p-310">Yeah, yeah, yes, yes, of course.</p>
<p id="p-311">I don't always watch it, but then I do, and I do like weekend update.</p>
<p id="p-312">I think that's funny.</p>
<p id="p-313">All right, Michelle, let's get into a real quick role play and then we'll hop off because we're running out of time here.</p>
<p id="p-314">So here we are old friends that knew each other in high school and we're talking about high school.</p>
<p id="p-315">So reflecting on it, right?</p>
<p id="p-316">Okay, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-317">It was a lot of fun, but we went to school with some mean people.</p>
<p id="p-318">Oh, I remember, Jerry used to mock all the teachers.</p>
<p id="p-319">It was funny sometimes, but not that nice.</p>
<p id="p-320">Yeah, it was pretty rude when he would imitate everything Ms.</p>
<p id="p-321">Smith said.</p>
<p id="p-322">Definitely.</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p id="p-323">Definitely.</p>
<p id="p-324">Remember when April got mad at Leah for copying her outfit?</p>
<p id="p-325">Of course.</p>
<p id="p-326">She didn't seem to think imitation was the highest form of flattery.</p>
<p id="p-327">I guess not.</p>
<p id="p-328">One of my favorite times in high school was when all the students had that assembly where they would impersonate the teachers.</p>
<p id="p-329">So fun that they had an assembly for that every year.</p>
<p id="p-330">Crazy.</p>
<p id="p-331">Yeah, they were pretty good at mimicking them.</p>
<p id="p-332">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-333">Sorry about that.</p>
<p id="p-334">No, that was me.</p>
<p id="p-335">Sorry.</p>
<p id="p-336">All right.</p>
<p id="p-337">So basically, yeah, we're reflecting on our high school experience and maybe there was a lot of mocking, mimicking, and imitating in high school, right?</p>
<p id="p-338">Teenagers will do that, right?</p>
<p id="p-339">So I said, oh, I remember Jerry used to mock all the teachers.</p>
<p id="p-340">And again, just reflecting on the meaning of mock, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-341">Mm-hmm.</p>
<p id="p-342">Imitate, but with a little bit of a mean spirit.</p>
<p id="p-343">And then we used imitate, right?</p>
<p id="p-344">You said, yeah, it was pretty rude that he would imitate everything</p>
<h2>Part-21</h2>
<p id="p-345">pretty rude that he would imitate everything Miss Smith said.</p>
<p id="p-346">So now we're just reaching for different vocabulary.</p>
<p id="p-347">You don't want to just say mock again in that scenario.</p>
<p id="p-348">You need the vocabulary range, right?</p>
<p id="p-349">Yes, Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-350">And then you said, remember when April got mad at Leah for copying her outfit?</p>
<p id="p-351">Mm-hmm.</p>
<p id="p-352">Nice, nice.</p>
<p id="p-353">And then you said, of course, she didn't seem to think imitation was the highest form of flattery.</p>
<p id="p-354">So that means April wasn't happy, didn't consider that a compliment, right?</p>
<p id="p-355">Right, right.</p>
<p id="p-356">She was just mad.</p>
<p id="p-357">And then you said, one of my favorite times in high school is when all the students had that assembly where they would impersonate the teachers.</p>
<p id="p-358">Mm-hmm.</p>
<p id="p-359">Yes, And then you said, yeah, they were pretty good at mimicking them.</p>
<p id="p-360">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-361">It makes me think of fashion.</p>
<p id="p-362">Isn't fashion just like the ultimate form of mimicking each other?</p>
<p id="p-363">We all just mimic each other.</p>
<p id="p-364">Like the new trend, the jean trends, the, you know, our wide leg jeans.</p>
<p id="p-365">I searched the internet.</p>
<h2>Part-22</h2>
<p id="p-366">not like I searched the internet to get skinny jeans still.</p>
<p id="p-367">I will not leave my skinny jeans.</p>
<p id="p-368">I will pay whatever I need to eventually.</p>
<p id="p-369">I'm sure I'll take on the wide leg.</p>
<p id="p-370">But it is true.</p>
<p id="p-371">Fashion is the ultimate mimicking in a sense.</p>
<p id="p-372">Yeah, that's true.</p>
<p id="p-373">And we all do.</p>
<p id="p-374">Yeah, because sometimes then it takes a little while for everybody to catch on new trends.</p>
<p id="p-375">But then when you see it enough, then eventually it happens to you too.</p>
<p id="p-376">And you're like, Oh, now I'm wearing wide leg pants.</p>
<p id="p-377">Yep, it will happen.</p>
<p id="p-378">So Michelle, is there another episode we should check out before we finish up today?</p>
<p id="p-379">Yes, guys, check out episode 2299 was do you know these expressions all too well?</p>
<p id="p-380">All right.</p>
<p id="p-381">Any takeaway for our listener?</p>
<p id="p-382">I think we've been super clear about the differences between mock and mimic.</p>
<p id="p-383">Where should we leave our listeners today?</p>
<p id="p-384">Well, guys, let us know if there are any celebrity impressions you can do.</p>
<p id="p-385">I want to know.</p>
<p id="p-386">And just in general, you know, think about with each of these words, they have positive or more negative connotation.</p>
<p id="p-387">So really think about which ones you're using.</p>
<p id="p-388">And like in the role play, you're not going to use my.</p>
<h2>Part-23</h2>
<p id="p-389">roleplay, you're not going to use mock just over and over and over.</p>
<p id="p-390">And this is like a common conversation that could happen.</p>
<p id="p-391">So, we really do need these tools.</p>
<p id="p-392">We need many different words to describe these situations.</p>
<p id="p-393">Yeah, Yes, 100%. So, we've taken away some interesting cultural tips here.</p>
<p id="p-394">We've gotten into Saturday Night Live, a lot of cultural pieces.</p>
<p id="p-395">And also, this is an episode for your vocabulary range.</p>
<p id="p-396">As Michelle said, don't just parrot the same words over and over again, right?</p>
<p id="p-397">Right, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-398">Just different words, okay?</p>
<p id="p-399">Very good.</p>
<p id="p-400">Throw in a different word to mean the same thing.</p>
<p id="p-401">That's what we're doing at the B1, B2, C1 level.</p>
<p id="p-402">You guys are ready for that.</p>
<p id="p-403">And that creates more connection.</p>
<p id="p-404">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-405">And for sure.</p>
<p id="p-406">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-407">Excellent, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-408">I'll see you next time.</p>
<p id="p-409">All right.</p>
