<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-17">It's all ESL dot com slash letter B number two.</p>
<p id="p-18">Hey Michelle, how's it going? Hey, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-19">Um, are you a rule follower? Well, I would say I, I mean, I've been known to Jaywalk.</p>
<p id="p-20">I will admit that but in terms of big rules, I think there's a reason they exist and I try to follow them.</p>
<p id="p-21">I pay taxes.</p>
<p id="p-22">I do all the things you're supposed to do but little things like I will cross the street, you know.</p>
<p id="p-23">You know, because I lived in New York and that's just normal.</p>
<p id="p-24">It's kind of weird to me when people just stand.</p>
<p id="p-25">Do you, do you Jaywalk, Michelle, I guess with kids you don't.</p>
<p id="p-26">Right, Uh What are your thoughts on it? Really? It really, it really does depend.</p>
<p id="p-27">Um, no, with kids, I definitely try and be more careful than if I were by myself.</p>
<p id="p-28">I definitely do Jaywalk.</p>
<p id="p-29">But the thing is, um, when I'm in a new place.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-30">When I'm in a new place.</p>
<p id="p-31">Like right now I'm like, just like, temporarily living in this town.</p>
<p id="p-32">And I don't know if it's ok if other people think it's ok to do that.</p>
<p id="p-33">I'm used to, I'm used to it being, oh, everybody does that.</p>
<p id="p-34">So it's fine.</p>
<p id="p-35">So now I find myself kind of looking around and looking around because I don't want to, the one person who does, I think you're more likely to find Jaywalkers on the, like in the northeast, the east coast, mid Atlantic City, urban areas versus the west.</p>
<p id="p-36">Where out here I've seen a lot more rule followers when it comes to not jaywalking, Michelle, what is jaywalking, by the way, we should know, should have our listeners know Jaywalking is when you cross the street.</p>
<p id="p-37">Even if you're not supposed to, even if the light, the little walking man isn't there.</p>
<p id="p-38">Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-39">And maybe you look both sides and there are literally no cars coming for a long time, you know, in New York City, I mean, people just</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-40">In New York City.</p>
<p id="p-41">I mean, people just, that's all they do is, you know, bigger cities, urban areas, that's what they do all the time.</p>
<p id="p-42">So, you know, that's one of the areas where I would say, I don't always follow the rules.</p>
<p id="p-43">Um What about you, Michelle? What do you think? And other, otherwise I think I'm a, I think I'm a pretty big rule follower actually.</p>
<p id="p-44">Um, you know, not to a ridiculous amount where if it really doesn't make sense.</p>
<p id="p-45">But I, I think it comes from my dad and my dad is a big rule follower.</p>
<p id="p-46">So I, I think I kind of caught on to that.</p>
<p id="p-47">That's good.</p>
<p id="p-48">I mean, that, that's how you have an organized society, right? Like a society that works and, and things run and everything works out, right? Uh That this is what we're getting into today, right? Rules or exceptions to rules.</p>
<p id="p-49">Do we have another episode that we want to send our listeners over to? Yep.</p>
<p id="p-50">So maybe, uh you wanna learn different rules to grammar or different things?</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-51">To grammar or different things, right? We talk about grammar rules and if they should be broken, right? We talk about that all the time on all those in English.</p>
<p id="p-52">But here we go.</p>
<p id="p-53">Episode 2266 just recently we did, we made it or we did it how to know the difference.</p>
<p id="p-54">Yes, And I want to take a minute just to announce to say thank you to some of our amazing listeners for leaving us a review in Apple podcast or wherever they listen.</p>
<p id="p-55">So I want to say thank you to Case K from the US on July 29th.</p>
<p id="p-56">He wrote us an amazing five star review, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-57">It is incredible.</p>
<p id="p-58">I will send it to you when we finish up today.</p>
<p id="p-59">It's great, by the way.</p>
<p id="p-60">Uh And then thank you to angling Dharma from Indonesia on July 31.</p>
<p id="p-61">Also a five star review.</p>
<p id="p-62">Amazing.</p>
<p id="p-63">And 967 from Saudi Arabia on August 3rd, my birthday.</p>
<p id="p-64">Thank you for the birthday review.</p>
<p id="p-65">Also a five star review.</p>
<p id="p-66">Oh my gosh, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-67">Amazing.</p>
<p id="p-68">Thank you guys so much.</p>
<p id="p-69">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-70">And when you leave</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-71">So much.</p>
<p id="p-72">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-73">And when you leave your rating and review, we will try to announce your name on the show.</p>
<p id="p-74">So go tell us what you think in Spotify or Apple Podcast and you may hear your name on the show.</p>
<p id="p-75">All right, definitely love it.</p>
<p id="p-76">Thank you guys again, so much.</p>
<p id="p-77">Keep it coming.</p>
<p id="p-78">Um So today we are going to talk about this expression that Lindsay touched on a little bit.</p>
<p id="p-79">Um It's with the word rule and this is really useful for giving explanations or reasons for something happening or not happening.</p>
<p id="p-80">Even Lindsay, what is it? OK, Here's the expression for today guys, write this down.</p>
<p id="p-81">The expression is the exception, not the rule.</p>
<p id="p-82">So we're referring to something, right? Yes, Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-83">And this means that something is pretty rare.</p>
<p id="p-84">We're gonna explain more about that and give a lot of examples.</p>
<p id="p-85">So don't you worry, uh sometimes you might also hear the exception rather than the rule, but that to me sounds a little more formal.</p>
<p id="p-86">What do you think Lindsay?</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-87">More formal.</p>
<p id="p-88">What do you think Lindsay? Yes, I agree.</p>
<p id="p-89">I'd say it's the exception, not the rule.</p>
<p id="p-90">On the other hand, Michelle, I've also heard the exception proves the rule.</p>
<p id="p-91">This is the exception that proves the rule.</p>
<p id="p-92">So that's another layer of complexity.</p>
<p id="p-93">But we'll start in a simple way and we'll really just get right into it with some examples, right? OK, All right.</p>
<p id="p-94">So let's do some examples.</p>
<p id="p-95">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-96">We got, we got a couple of role plays for you right.</p>
<p id="p-97">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-98">So she's late.</p>
<p id="p-99">I know it's frustrating but with her, that's the exception, not the rule.</p>
<p id="p-100">OK, So what are you saying here about the person that is late? What are you saying that typically this person is on time? Right? So this is out of the norm.</p>
<p id="p-101">This is not usual.</p>
<p id="p-102">So I'm basically saying, give her a break.</p>
<p id="p-103">This is trust me.</p>
<p id="p-104">This doesn't happen often.</p>
<p id="p-105">So you, you know, it's, it's an explanation I'm giving, I'm saying give this person a little</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-106">Giving him saying, give this person a little grace.</p>
<p id="p-107">Yes, Give the person Grace.</p>
<p id="p-108">We've talked a lot this summer about a lot and Grace giving ourselves some gray last few episodes, guys, if you have no idea what you're talking about, you may not be following the podcast which you want to make sure you're doing.</p>
<p id="p-109">Hit that follow button.</p>
<p id="p-110">All right.</p>
<p id="p-111">So here's another role play, right.</p>
<p id="p-112">Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-113">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-114">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-115">I'm so sorry.</p>
<p id="p-116">I totally forgot to bring your book.</p>
<p id="p-117">Oh, don't worry about it.</p>
<p id="p-118">I promise this is the exception, not the rule with me.</p>
<p id="p-119">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-120">So you're saying this is not normal for me? I, I feel like that word normal or norm is coming up a lot today.</p>
<p id="p-121">Right, Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-122">This is saying this is the exception, not the rule.</p>
<p id="p-123">It's something out of the norm.</p>
<p id="p-124">So um you can use it to explain these situations to keep that connection.</p>
<p id="p-125">Oh This is the exception, not the rule.</p>
<p id="p-126">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-127">And there are other ways we could say this because I</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-128">We could say this because I suppose it's a little less common than certain other things we might say to say the same thing.</p>
<p id="p-129">Right, Um, but there's another variation on this expression that we want our listeners to know about too.</p>
<p id="p-130">Right, Right, So this is just one little change.</p>
<p id="p-131">So it's the exception to the rule.</p>
<p id="p-132">Sure.</p>
<p id="p-133">Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-134">Do you think this is any different? Do you hear this one about the same? I think it's the same thing.</p>
<p id="p-135">Same idea.</p>
<p id="p-136">I think our listeners are very familiar with this due to grammar rules and, you know, grammar rules in their own languages and grammar rules in English.</p>
<p id="p-137">Right, I mean, you talk a lot about the rule and then here all this, here's a huge list of exceptions to that rule.</p>
<p id="p-138">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-139">And I think a while back we did an episode about how, maybe it's like music, how, when you learn something, you kind of have to learn the rules and then you learn how to break them or do something.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-140">Learn how to break them or do something different.</p>
<p id="p-141">Yeah, that's totally true.</p>
<p id="p-142">I mean, that's how true art gets created is painting outside the lines is not to use cliches or anything here.</p>
<p id="p-143">But it's true.</p>
<p id="p-144">It's true.</p>
<p id="p-145">Um But I think this one is pretty much the same, but inmate might put more of a positive spin on something because it doesn't use the word.</p>
<p id="p-146">Not so maybe for explaining how something should happen.</p>
<p id="p-147">So let's give a little example of that.</p>
<p id="p-148">OK, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-149">The parties always start at six.</p>
<p id="p-150">The exception to the rule would be if there are two in one day, then we would start at seven.</p>
<p id="p-151">OK, Got it.</p>
<p id="p-152">All right.</p>
<p id="p-153">So that's just one example of where we would change the expression slightly and just say the exception to the rule.</p>
<p id="p-154">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-155">OK, Michelle, we are back here.</p>
<p id="p-156">So we, as we were talking about what we're actually saying here, I feel like the word norm came up a lot, right? Normal, the normal.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-157">Right, Normal, the norm.</p>
<p id="p-158">What's out of the norm, right? Norm.</p>
<p id="p-159">Right, Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-160">So that is a good one, guys.</p>
<p id="p-161">So norm, right? That would just stand for normal.</p>
<p id="p-162">Um, and we could say the norm, right? That's not the norm because you're not, you wouldn't say that's not the normal, you would say that's not normal.</p>
<p id="p-163">Right? Or when you add a Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-164">Or just to bring it down to like kind of more conversational language, let's say I was late to that coffee shop, right? Um, I might say something like normally I'm not late.</p>
<p id="p-165">Right, That might be the most person to person, street language.</p>
<p id="p-166">Right, Usually, usually, or normally I'm not late, I'm so sorry today, like, you know, my dog got sick and all this stuff.</p>
<p id="p-167">Right, Yeah, I mean, and sometimes life is full of these things and we have to be able to express this when you're, it's not that you're necessarily making excuses, but you are giving a little bit of a peek into.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-168">A little bit of a peek into why something might happen or who you are as a person, especially if somebody doesn't know you very well.</p>
<p id="p-169">Um, to use these expressions to explain it's true.</p>
<p id="p-170">But don't say it if you're actually perpetually late.</p>
<p id="p-171">Right, I don't know if you know anyone who's just a late person.</p>
<p id="p-172">Are you a late person, Michelle? I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-173">I was late today to our recording.</p>
<p id="p-174">So, who am I to speak? I'm, I'm late sometimes too.</p>
<p id="p-175">Um, yeah, I, I mean, I can be late but I, I, I think I've gotten better.</p>
<p id="p-176">My brother is the worst.</p>
<p id="p-177">I have a few friends who are and not from other parts of the world where it's more standard to be late American friends who are just late people and they just will show up pretty much every time, like half an hour late and it's tricky.</p>
<p id="p-178">And I think how does that happen? You know, is it that we just leave the house too late? What are we doing? Right, And, and why am I using weed? That could be</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-179">And why am I using weed? That could be an interesting episode right there.</p>
<p id="p-180">Oh, I've been thinking about that a lot actually when at restaurants lately because I was, oh, are we working on this? That would be a great episode.</p>
<p id="p-181">Write it down.</p>
<p id="p-182">What are we ordering tonight? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-183">Yeah, guys.</p>
<p id="p-184">Hit, follow on the show.</p>
<p id="p-185">We'll cover that another day.</p>
<p id="p-186">But yeah, there are people out there that are just late, even though they know, like if they're in American culture, you should be on time or five minutes late at the worst.</p>
<p id="p-187">Um, they're just late, late, late, late.</p>
<p id="p-188">So it is how it is, it is what it is.</p>
<p id="p-189">What are you going to do? I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-190">Um, let's talk about a couple other words that could fit in the same idea.</p>
<p id="p-191">So, the first one is outlier.</p>
<p id="p-192">Um, this is not exactly the same but it's basically something that is outside of what is typical.</p>
<p id="p-193">Right, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-194">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-195">And this one is used a lot by scientists to talk about results of things, studies.</p>
<p id="p-196">It's a little more academic language, but I can also use it in conversations because it sounds</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-197">Use it in conversations because it sounds smart.</p>
<p id="p-198">There aren't any outliers in our schedule.</p>
<p id="p-199">So we should be good to go.</p>
<p id="p-200">You could.</p>
<p id="p-201">But again, it is more useful with talking about stats and studies, things like that.</p>
<p id="p-202">But I wanted to give an example and I think there's a whole book titled entitled Outliers by Malcolm WWE Right, Yes, Yes, there is.</p>
<p id="p-203">Oh, I've never read it but I, I always, I wanted to, I think it might have been on my shelf for the last five years and then maybe I don't need it.</p>
<p id="p-204">I never read it, but I have to get it back.</p>
<p id="p-205">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-206">Anomaly, anomaly, I like it.</p>
<p id="p-207">What does it mean? Anomaly? So it's the same idea of outside of the norm.</p>
<p id="p-208">It's just, it's a fancy way of saying this is definitely gonna impress people.</p>
<p id="p-209">So you could say, don't worry, this is a total anomaly.</p>
<p id="p-210">This won't happen every time.</p>
<p id="p-211">It's fun to be able to have this more rare, high level word and it's not high brow</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-212">And it's not high brow in the sense that, like, it's going to intimidate people.</p>
<p id="p-213">It's not like academic talk.</p>
<p id="p-214">It's just rare, different.</p>
<p id="p-215">It's varied.</p>
<p id="p-216">It's interesting.</p>
<p id="p-217">So, throw it in.</p>
<p id="p-218">Yeah, I, I, I agree with you.</p>
<p id="p-219">There's something about this word, even though it seems like you would only see it in a textbook.</p>
<p id="p-220">It's not true.</p>
<p id="p-221">It just, it does come up, it does come up and it should come up for our listeners guys as you're stretching your vocabulary.</p>
<p id="p-222">Not always repeating the same words.</p>
<p id="p-223">That's how we get stuck at that B two level.</p>
<p id="p-224">Right, We want to move up to C one into C 2 99% fluency.</p>
<p id="p-225">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-226">That's right.</p>
<p id="p-227">That's right.</p>
<p id="p-228">So, let's do a role play and put it all together.</p>
<p id="p-229">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-230">I'm ready.</p>
<p id="p-231">We are planning a picnic.</p>
<p id="p-232">I love picnics.</p>
<p id="p-233">Love your heart.</p>
<p id="p-234">The summertime.</p>
<p id="p-235">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-236">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-237">Um, ok.</p>
<p id="p-238">So I'll bring all the desserts.</p>
<p id="p-239">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-240">But there will be so much food there.</p>
<p id="p-241">Maybe it's too much.</p>
<p id="p-242">Ah, we'll be ok.</p>
<p id="p-243">Well, I don't want it to all go to waste.</p>
<p id="p-244">Oh, this is the exception.</p>
<p id="p-245">Not the rule.</p>
<p id="p-246">We don't</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-247">This is the exception, not the rule.</p>
<p id="p-248">We don't do it every time.</p>
<p id="p-249">I know, but I always try to keep the food to the minimum.</p>
<p id="p-250">The only exception to the rule would be if we had somewhere to donate it after.</p>
<p id="p-251">Um, ok.</p>
<p id="p-252">Well, we could work on that.</p>
<p id="p-253">It's a bit of an anomaly with these parties.</p>
<p id="p-254">So I'd never think of that.</p>
<p id="p-255">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-256">But it's important.</p>
<p id="p-257">This might be the one outlier.</p>
<p id="p-258">Ok.</p>
<p id="p-259">I'll look into our options.</p>
<p id="p-260">Sometimes it's a challenge to write these role plays.</p>
<p id="p-261">Right? You put all these together.</p>
<p id="p-262">It really is.</p>
<p id="p-263">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-264">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-265">How could you tell? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-266">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-267">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-268">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-269">It's a little bit of a challenge.</p>
<p id="p-270">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-271">I think, uh for sure.</p>
<p id="p-272">Um I think, I think typically where I would imagine to see these words is when we're talking about something societal, like societal trends, like inflation.</p>
<p id="p-273">I was just reading an article about inflation that it's, you know, the cost of food, grocery prices have gone up 20% since 2019 and now it's edging down there would be</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-274">There would be ways in that kind of conversation to really bring in these, these words.</p>
<p id="p-275">So you don't think the picnic conversation was appropriate here? It's ok.</p>
<p id="p-276">I think there could have been something better, but, you know, we can stretch our minds here.</p>
<p id="p-277">Michelle, let's go, let's go through these and see and see where we use them.</p>
<p id="p-278">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-279">OK, All right.</p>
<p id="p-280">All right.</p>
<p id="p-281">OK, So, uh I said, ok, you're very nervous about this food was and I said this is the exception, not the rule.</p>
<p id="p-282">We don't do it every time.</p>
<p id="p-283">So I'm saying this is not the norm, not the norm.</p>
<p id="p-284">And then you, I said the only exception to the rule would be if we had someone somewhere to donate it.</p>
<p id="p-285">So normally I keep it to a minimum, but there is an exception to that rule.</p>
<p id="p-286">The rule of keeping it to a minimum is that if I have a place to donate it.</p>
<p id="p-287">So just to kind of explain here guys.</p>
<p id="p-288">Yes, Yes, And I said, it's a bit of an anomaly with these parties.</p>
<p id="p-289">So I never think of that.</p>
<p id="p-290">So I'm saying we don't</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p id="p-291">I never think of that.</p>
<p id="p-292">So I'm saying we don't do this a lot.</p>
<p id="p-293">Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-294">So you're saying the fact of having the party is an anomaly? Yeah.</p>
<p id="p-295">So we're not, yeah, we don't have this every day.</p>
<p id="p-296">So I'm not interested in worrying about that assumption.</p>
<p id="p-297">And then I said, yeah, but it's important, this might be the one outlier.</p>
<p id="p-298">And what am I saying here? What is the outlier? What, what was it, the party or what? That, that um the, it's the outlier that we should worry about this.</p>
<p id="p-299">Like I'm saying, I don't normally worry about this.</p>
<p id="p-300">But you're saying maybe you should, yeah, I know, maybe, maybe, maybe I could have done a better role play for this one.</p>
<p id="p-301">So, yeah, I think there's lots of, you know, it's like Malcolm Gladwell, right? That's how he titled his book Outliers.</p>
<p id="p-302">That's what he writes about.</p>
<p id="p-303">He writes about theories and society and trends and changes and those are actually really interesting conversations guys.</p>
<p id="p-304">So,</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p id="p-305">Interesting conversations, guys.</p>
<p id="p-306">So that's where you're gonna see these words come up, see if you can, uh, pick up the paper, read about what's going on and then open a conversation with a native speaker about societal trends, you know, love it.</p>
<p id="p-307">Very good societal trends or picnics, whatever you like or picnics.</p>
<p id="p-308">Yes, At the picnic, you could talk about the trends in society.</p>
<p id="p-309">Right, Well, there you go.</p>
<p id="p-310">There you go.</p>
<p id="p-311">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-312">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-313">All right, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-314">Any final takeaways for today? Anything? Um, yeah, I guess this, uh, that role play wasn't the norm but, uh, we, we still were able to put everything together and give these a try.</p>
<p id="p-315">Um, think about how you could use them in your daily life.</p>
<p id="p-316">All right.</p>
