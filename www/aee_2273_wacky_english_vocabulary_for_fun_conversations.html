<p>Hello, Aubrey.</p>
<p>How's it going today? I'm great.</p>
<p>How are you, Lindsay? I'm feeling great today, but I do have a question to start off our show today.</p>
<p>Let's hear it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, do you know anyone in your life or maybe on TV? That is really wacky.</p>
<p>Oh, wacky.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Jim Carrey comes to mind for sure.</p>
<p>He has a really wacky sense of humor.</p>
<p>Always doing things that you would not expect right out of left field if I think about my personal life.</p>
<p>I definitely know people who are unique, funny.</p>
<p>Maybe even a little weird, but I don't think I would call anyone wacky.</p>
<p>What about you? Right, I think wacky is pretty extreme.</p>
<p>The personalities that come to mind.</p>
<p>I think Jim Carrey is.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>I think Jim Carrey, especially in, he was in Dumb and Dumber, right? With Sean Daniels or Jeff Daniels.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or like screech in saved by the bell was kind of a wacky personality.</p>
<p>You know, personalities are like, intentionally being really extreme with like a clown, a clown who's intentionally trying to make people laugh loudly by just doing really wacky things.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Very silly.</p>
<p>So, that's a good example.</p>
<p>Today we're getting into this word wacky.</p>
<p>I have a feeling Aubrey that our listeners have maybe never heard this word.</p>
<p>It's a little more rare than just weird, strange, even like bizarre that we don't hear wacky quite as often because it's so extreme.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure, guys hit the follow button because over here at all, English, we teach you those words that you will not see in your textbook and you probably won't see in a classroom either.</p>
<p>Right, Aubrey.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yes, Hit.</p>
<p>Follow here on the podcast.</p>
<p>This question came from youtube.</p>
<p>So if you prefer to like, watch a video, we're over on youtube as well and we've got this great question.</p>
<p>They</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>We've got this great question.</p>
<p>They actually had, listen to an episode.</p>
<p>You and Michelle recorded Lindsay 2213, Weird versus Strange in English.</p>
<p>That was a really fun episode.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was fun.</p>
<p>And then this follow up question came from that, you know, that episode and here's the question.</p>
<p>So the student says, I think there is also the expression of wacky and weird.</p>
<p>What does that mean? How is wacky different from weird and strange? Thanks.</p>
<p>I love this.</p>
<p>I love that this student listened to an episode and they've got a lot of information about weird and strange and some of these words, but they didn't hear wacky and they're like, ok, I've also heard wacky and I'm not sure when I could use it, how I could use it.</p>
<p>So this fun follow up question makes it like a part two for that episode.</p>
<p>And I also love, is it called double alliteration when you have two words that have the same letter at the beginning, Wacky and Weird.</p>
<p>I love those.</p>
<p>They just, they roll off your tongue.</p>
<p>We could do another episode about double alliterations and why they work maybe.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Right, Alliteration is really fun when.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Right, Alliteration is really fun whenever you have that same consonant sound to it just makes like, it's great for jingles for commercials and anything like this.</p>
<p>Right, Wacky and weird.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>And so that's probably why this phrase stuck in the mind of our listener because it is a double iteration, wacky and weird.</p>
<p>So, what was that other episode? Just to make sure our listeners go back to that one? 2213.</p>
<p>You can scroll up to see it weird versus strange in English.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Let's get into it, Aubrey.</p>
<p>So, first we're going to teach the two words, a refresher on the word weird.</p>
<p>And we're going to see what wacky means and then let's put them together and see if that compounds the meaning or something.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yes, Right, Ok.</p>
<p>So wacky first.</p>
<p>Right, It means really funny, amusing, but in an odd or peculiar way.</p>
<p>So odd is an interesting word.</p>
<p>That's why you asked me if I know anyone who's wacky.</p>
<p>And I'm like, I don't know if I would describe anyone as wacky because I feel like it is a little bit negative.</p>
<p>There's this color</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>A little bit negative.</p>
<p>There's this collocation, this connotation of it being odd.</p>
<p>Whereas strange, weird.</p>
<p>These are more lighthearted wacky if I called someone wacky and they aren't intentionally being really odd with their humor, they might be offended.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, I think someone who, I mean, they may be self described wacky.</p>
<p>Right, And in that case they own it.</p>
<p>That's ok.</p>
<p>But often this person might be a little bit of a social outcast, kind of, kind of weird, kind of on the outside.</p>
<p>You know what I think about the Reagan in the Olympics when she did her break dancing routine.</p>
<p>And this was such a meme.</p>
<p>It was all over the news.</p>
<p>It was, people were finding it quite wacky.</p>
<p>It was different than the average breakdancing.</p>
<p>Um, you know, it was, she was doing like a kangaroo move.</p>
<p>People were, like, making fun of because they thought it was very odd, very peculiar.</p>
<p>I actually loved it.</p>
<p>And she, she was, she know she didn't get any points, the judges didn't love it.</p>
<p>But she was saying</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>I just didn't love it.</p>
<p>But she was saying she intentionally was being creative and different wanting to do something.</p>
<p>But so she kind of was purposely being a little bit wacky with her dance moves.</p>
<p>Well, I love that idea because it was the first year that break dancing was in the Olympics, right? Yes, So starting something.</p>
<p>The last L A said we're not doing break dancing and some people I think are blaming her, but that's crazy.</p>
<p>Like that's definitely not why it's happening in my opinion, why they're not just break dancing.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>I guess I missed the whole controversy.</p>
<p>I cannot believe we missed it.</p>
<p>Lindsay, you'll have to go and google it when we leave here.</p>
<p>That is so funny.</p>
<p>So wacky is just a little or maybe kind of outlandish.</p>
<p>Could be another word we might use to describe it.</p>
<p>A bit of an outcast over the top, right? You might say that was a really wacky movie.</p>
<p>This reminds me of everything everywhere all at once.</p>
<p>Is that what it was called? I loved that film, but it was a little bit wacky.</p>
<p>There people had like hot dog fingers because there were all these different dimensions.</p>
<p>There were some things that were definitely wacky in that movie.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>There were some things that were definitely wacky in that movie.</p>
<p>Uh, and then you had an example about an uncle, right? So, should I read that one, Aubrey? Let's do it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I had an uncle that was really wacky.</p>
<p>Always playing practical jokes on everyone.</p>
<p>Um, it often describes the sense of humor, right? Like we mentioned Jim Carrey.</p>
<p>I feel like everyone maybe has an uncle like that or someone who's, like, telling jokes or playing practical jokes and, and they would maybe, like you said, Lindsay self, like, describe themselves as wacky or having a wacky sense of humor.</p>
<p>Yeah, 100%.</p>
<p>So that is wacky.</p>
<p>It's a little over the top a bit more than weird.</p>
<p>Even.</p>
<p>What is the difference then? With weird now? Yeah.</p>
<p>So weird is more like, strange, unusual, unexpected, but we wouldn't really say odd or peculiar necessarily.</p>
<p>Those are more specific meanings with wacky where it's like this is really, like you said over the top and odd and peculiar.</p>
<p>So just more extreme weird is a little more normal, I guess.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>A little more normal, I guess a little weird as normal on all their English at least.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love it.</p>
<p>So, for example, something weird happened last night.</p>
<p>I kept getting phone calls when I'd answer the line would go dead.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that's not wacky.</p>
<p>There's nothing wacky.</p>
<p>It's, that's more creepy.</p>
<p>Weird.</p>
<p>Can be, like, strange, creepy, unusual.</p>
<p>Unexpected.</p>
<p>I might sound weird but I've never been to the beach.</p>
<p>Like, that's just different.</p>
<p>Unexpected.</p>
<p>Whereas neither of those things are wacky because wacky is more, like, peculiar, like, just intentionally or unintentionally being very strange.</p>
<p>And I think wacky also has a, has a silly nature to it too.</p>
<p>Right, Silly.</p>
<p>Kind of whether unintentionally or not.</p>
<p>It's very silly and silly is sometimes defined as stupid and silly is sometimes defined as playful and I think of it more as playful.</p>
<p>Right, Of that definition.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Kind of playful.</p>
<p>There's a</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>Yeah, kind of playful.</p>
<p>There's a playfulness in wackiness but that's not present really in weird all the time.</p>
<p>It could be, but it's not necessarily weird, is actually a lot more flexible because you could be like, oh, I was being really weird when or that clown was weird.</p>
<p>Like someone that is more being whack and silly, you could maybe call them weird, but you can rarely use wacky.</p>
<p>Like all of these examples.</p>
<p>Something's more creepy, weird.</p>
<p>You wouldn't say wacky.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It's definitely not wacky that you're getting a phone call at night and the lines going dead is the beginning of a horror movie.</p>
<p>That's weird.</p>
<p>There's nothing silly or playful about it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Good stuff.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Now, we are going to go into that double iteration and put it into one fun phrase that our listener asked about Aubrey.</p>
<p>Tell us about this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So our listener asked about, they have heard someone say wacky and weird just saying it together.</p>
<p>This isn't really an idiom or an expression.</p>
<p>It's pretty rare.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>Expression.</p>
<p>It's pretty rare, but you could definitely hear it.</p>
<p>And I think it's what you said, Lindsay, it's that alliteration of the double doubles, right? So it might be just kind of fun.</p>
<p>Like Reagan's another example, I could totally see someone describing this break dancer and be like her performance was wacky and weird.</p>
<p>And so it's almost, you're doubling up on it, right? It's not enough just to say it's wacky.</p>
<p>I'm doubling down for emphasis.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>So you're driving home your point uh to be both in one person or in one show is extra, extra.</p>
<p>It is extra, extra even more over the top, right? We just use both to share that.</p>
<p>It was extremely surprising, bizarre, silly, playful.</p>
<p>We would never say, oh, this phone call.</p>
<p>That was creepy.</p>
<p>We wouldn't say that was wacky and weird.</p>
<p>No, because if we add wacky, it's just like, it's more playful and silly like you said.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>So describing a movie as wacky and weird or can we flip it?</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>Weird.</p>
<p>Or can we flip it? I'm wondering about this.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>Because it's not really like a known, this isn't a known saying wacky and weird.</p>
<p>This is a matter of someone combining two adjectives and it kind of works.</p>
<p>But this is not a known saying or proverb or.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So because of that, we could totally flip it and say weird and wacky.</p>
<p>I might say, my sister said she went on a date last night and it was a weird and wacky and then of course, I'm going to go into details and share like, what was so strange.</p>
<p>What was so odd.</p>
<p>Um, but it's because it's not an idiom.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be word for word.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be in that order.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It's important to know what is actually an idiom or saying and what's just combining two words and saying something that feels kind of zippy.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>It feels good to say it right.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>It's fun to say it's the alliteration.</p>
<p>I love Zippy.</p>
<p>It does sound zippy but it is a little tricky.</p>
<p>I think the main thing it'll be good to go into a role play here.</p>
<p>But we want to think about what we would not say this about.</p>
<p>We shared the creepy phone call.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>About.</p>
<p>We shared like the creepy phone call.</p>
<p>Anything that's creepy, weird, you know, unexpected in a way that's not super positive or playful.</p>
<p>We wouldn't say wacky at all.</p>
<p>So we also wouldn't say wacky and weird.</p>
<p>Yes, Yes, totally agree.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>Should we go into the role play, Aubrey to show our listeners where this comes into our language? Yeah.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Let's do it.</p>
<p>We are leaving the opening of a play, opening night.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>That play was kind of wacky and weird.</p>
<p>I liked it though.</p>
<p>It was very unique.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>The costumes and sets were all really wacky.</p>
<p>Felt strange when the play was so serious.</p>
<p>That was a bit weird.</p>
<p>Kept me on my toes.</p>
<p>So I can imagine this, like, something about it was wacky, but in a playful way it wasn't dark if I'm calling it wacky.</p>
<p>Right, I imagine like the producers, I could see someone leaving that play.</p>
<p>And if you guys have seen the Broadway Show, the producers, they intentionally do this play that they expect to be a flop, they expect it to</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>Expect to be a flop.</p>
<p>They expect it to fail and it's about Hitler and the holocaust, but they're making it sort of wacky.</p>
<p>And that, because it's seen as like a farce as, like, sarcastic, it ends up being successful.</p>
<p>But I could imagine people leaving that play and they would say wacky, whereas that wasn't expected, they thought it would be perceived as really dark.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So there's a lot of nuances here when it comes to the meeting.</p>
<p>Right, This is about leveling up to that 99% fluency level.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Let's go through this.</p>
<p>I first said that play was kind of wacky and weird.</p>
<p>So this is, we're discussing right as we leave the play, you know, we haven't talked yet about our thoughts but I have found it very bizarre and strange but, like, not dark, kind of playful or I wouldn't call it wacky.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And then I said, yeah, that was a bit weird.</p>
<p>Kept me on my toes so interesting that I said, kept me on my toes.</p>
<p>I dropped the subject there, right, because it's more informal ground.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>Yes, Right, Because it's more informal grammar.</p>
<p>You don't have to say it kept me on my toes and definitely don't repeat the subject.</p>
<p>It's known to say, like the play kept me on my toes.</p>
<p>This is a, an idiom though.</p>
<p>To keep something to keep you on your toes means like you didn't know what to expect, you know, what was coming.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Have you seen any other good plays lately? Aubrey? Anything else out in the Broadway world or off Broadway world? Anything else there are plays when Broadway shows tour here they come to the A S U Arizona State University to Gamage Auditorium and we do go, sometimes I love it.</p>
<p>We went to Hamilton, which was amazing.</p>
<p>Um, we went to Finding Neverland was really good with our kids.</p>
<p>Annie.</p>
<p>What about you? Do? You go to Broadway shows a lot? Well, yeah, I mean, when I lived in New York, I used to love going to Broadway shows here.</p>
<p>I'm a little less inclined, although I know there's good talent here in Denver because I know there's like a direct path to New York people coming back and forth.</p>
<p>I don't know why Exactly.</p>
<p>But there seems to be that.</p>
<p>So we've gone to a couple of.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>So we've gone to a couple of local plays over the last few years, which are pretty cool.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>I love to do that too.</p>
<p>Especially if you can go in a very small venue.</p>
<p>We went to Dirty Rotten scoundrels.</p>
<p>They did a play in this tiny theater where the audience surrounds the stage.</p>
<p>So everyone's really close.</p>
<p>Those are so fun.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And we did interview my friend Alan Seals who is, he is very much involved in the Broadway community in New York.</p>
<p>If you guys are interested in learning more about Broadway, come back to Allers English dot com type in Alan A L A N, you'll find my interview with Alan really fun insider information about Broadway, good stuff.</p>
<p>And then the last one, I just said the costumes and sets were all really wacky.</p>
<p>So that's why you loved the play.</p>
<p>And so I'm kind of having to share what I thought was wacky.</p>
<p>Right, Well, the costumes and sets were, and this would mean outlandish, unexpected, maybe really bright colors and then the play was very serious.</p>
<p>So I found that kind of wacky</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p>So I found that kind of wacky, right? Or what you said with the hot dogs fingers, right? Have you seen, it's everything everywhere all at once.</p>
<p>I actually haven't seen it.</p>
<p>I need to watch it.</p>
<p>It always comes up on my Netflix, like, watch this.</p>
<p>You know, it was a suggestion.</p>
<p>I cried.</p>
<p>It's very heartwarming.</p>
<p>It's very touching, but it also is wacky.</p>
<p>So not anyone and Lindsay if you watch you be prepared for because there are all these other dimensions where it's, you know, it's not just like humans on earth.</p>
<p>So strange and wacky, but so good.</p>
<p>Actually, it's such a great movie.</p>
<p>It won a ton of Oscars.</p>
<p>It won a ton of Academy Awards because it was.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I will check it out.</p>
<p>I will check it out.</p>
<p>This is a great phrase.</p>
<p>I mean, I think our listeners are now ready to carry this into their daily lives, connecting with native speakers.</p>
<p>What's our takeaway today? Aubrey? Well, think about when wacky things happen to you.</p>
<p>This is such a great way to connect because it's something out of the ordinary, something unexpected.</p>
<p>What a great thing to spark</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p>What a great thing to spark a conversation about to let someone know that you thought something was wacky and weird.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>This is a great conversation starter as you said.</p>
<p>And sometimes it's the more outlandish things that connect us to people.</p>
<p>It's what people remember.</p>
<p>Those are the stories people remember about us is what connects us.</p>
<p>It makes you laugh and when you laugh together you actually connect, you build that emotional connection.</p>
<p>So go for it.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Right, The best conversations are when you're laughing and sharing some common humor.</p>
<p>So fun.</p>
