<p>Hello, Aubrey.</p>
<p>Happy Thursday.</p>
<p>We're recording today on a Thursday.</p>
<p>How's it going?</p>
<p>Happy Thursday to you, Lindsay.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>Good, good.</p>
<p>Doing great.</p>
<p>Aubrey, here's a question for you.</p>
<p>You ready?</p>
<p>Yeah, So I'm curious about your style.</p>
<p>So when something doesn't go according to plan or your plan for that day, does it affect your mood or are you able to roll with it?</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>Or are you able to roll with it?</p>
<p>What's your style?</p>
<p>That is a great question.</p>
<p>I feel like in general I'm able to roll with the punches, right?</p>
<p>If something comes up, I don't really let it affect my mood, but it really depends.</p>
<p>My mood is more affected by, like, my children's behavior.</p>
<p>Or if something really terrible happens, if there were, like, a medical emergency and suddenly, that's probably going to affect my mood.</p>
<p>But minor things, I don't think so.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>Well, I think that makes sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I might be a little more rigid than you are because, I mean, you have four kids.</p>
<p>You've learned to be flexible.</p>
<p>I've been forced.</p>
<p>Yeah, you've been forced.</p>
<p>You know the day's not going to go as you plan it, right?</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>But no, I've always been a pretty laid-back person, especially when I travel.</p>
<p>I'm definitely not rigid.</p>
<p>I don't need certain things to happen.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can have very serendipitous moments when you're traveling and something doesn't happen according to plan, right?</p>
<p>That's smart when you're traveling to be able to be more spontaneous and take advantage of whatever might happen.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>Whatever might happen, I love that.</p>
<p>This is interesting.</p>
<p>You'll notice in the question Lindsay asked me, we have this verb affect.</p>
<p>Does it affect your mood?</p>
<p>We were asked a great question from YouTube, likely one that many of you either have or have thought about because affect and effect in English spelled differently, different meanings, sound exactly the same.</p>
<p>So this is really tricky.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is a good one.</p>
<p>It's a classic question and a classic confusing point, right?</p>
<p>So I'm going to go ahead and read our listener's question or our viewer's question.</p>
<p>Shinar Ghafoor asks, thanks a lot for your lessons.</p>
<p>I have a question.</p>
<p>When should I use affect and when should I use effect?</p>
<p>Right, And the first one with an A affect and the second one with an E effect.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>And I do want to remind our listeners, we have an entire YouTube channel.</p>

<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>But if you prefer podcasts, hit follow on the podcast, all right?</p>
<p>Yes, and that's a great place to leave us comments like this one.</p>
<p>Leave us your questions.</p>
<p>We get a lot of questions for the episodes there on YouTube.</p>
<p>Yes, and we read them all.</p>
<p>We put them in our big list.</p>
<p>And if it's a good question, we feature it like this one.</p>
<p>So let's dive into it, Aubrey.</p>
<p>Yeah, so this is tricky.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these sound the same, which really makes it difficult when we're writing to know which to choose.</p>
<p>We have to think about the meaning.</p>
<p>So we're going to dive into that.</p>
<p>And then we're going to share because these both do have different meanings, one of which is pronounced differently.</p>
<p>So we're diving into all of that today.</p>
<p>So stay to the end.</p>
<p>Yeah, it sounds like a big plan here.</p>
<p>All right, so let's start with the first one.</p>
<p>Effect is a verb, right?</p>
<p>What kind of effect are we talking about first, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yeah, so this is the verb.</p>
<p>It starts with an A, A-F-F-E-C-T. This means to have an influence on someone or something.</p>
<p>So like our conversation at the top of the episode, does what happens throughout the day</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>Does what happens throughout the day affect your mood?</p>
<p>Because in that sentence, affect is a verb.</p>
<p>Does it, you know, change your mood?</p>
<p>Would it be altered?</p>
<p>There we would spell it with an A, affect.</p>
<p>Yeah, so how will this affect my day, like we said, or don't let it affect you.</p>
<p>For example, if you're someone that reads the news and gets really thrown off, right, that could be hard right now.</p>
<p>Exactly, right?</p>
<p>It's hard to, I have to just avoid the news because it is going to affect me.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>So what affects you?</p>
<p>This is really important to keep in mind.</p>
<p>This is a verb, okay?</p>
<p>And when you're writing, this is the best way to know how to spell it, which one to use.</p>
<p>Because if you're just hearing it spoken, they sound exactly the same for most English speakers.</p>
<p>I say them exactly the same.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>And then when it comes to the noun form, well, the noun word, it's a different word, right?</p>
<p>We're not talking about forms here.</p>
<p>It's an entirely different word.</p>
<p>Effect with an E, yeah?</p>
<p>But usually when we say it in a sentence, just sounds like affect.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>in a sentence, just sounds like a fact.</p>
<p>So unfortunately, they sound the same.</p>
<p>This is a change, which is a result or consequence of an action or another cause.</p>
<p>So for example, what is the effect of long-term isolation?</p>
<p>Good question.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>Smoking has many harmful effects, and we know that now based on science, right?</p>
<p>Exactly, right?</p>
<p>So for both of these, it would be written with an E, E-F-F-E-C-T. And when you're writing, and even native English speakers have to sometimes think of this as a common native error as well, because they sound the same.</p>
<p>Sometimes you have to take just a second to think about how is this used in the sentence?</p>
<p>Is it being used as a verb?</p>
<p>Then it should be an A. Is it being used as a noun?</p>
<p>Okay, then I write it with an E. Yeah, I mean, frankly, I still have to stop and think about it, right?</p>
<p>I do too sometimes, for sure.</p>
<p>I never make the mistake anymore.</p>
<p>I used to, but I do have to stop and think, right?</p>
<p>Okay, which one am I using now?</p>
<p>So it's very normal to have to stop and think.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Right, there is an...</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>There is a mnemonic you can use, right?</p>
<p>So raven, R-A-V-E-N is like a blackbird, like a crow.</p>
<p>And there's a mnemonic that uses the first letters of that word.</p>
<p>It's remember that affect, with an A, is a verb and effect, with an E, is a noun.</p>
<p>So you can go through if you're like trying to remember, okay, which was which?</p>
<p>Can't remember.</p>
<p>Raven, remember affect is a verb and effect is a noun.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>You just need to remember the kind of bird, right?</p>
<p>That's a raven.</p>
<p>Raven, raven.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>What else do we need to know?</p>
<p>Is there any caveat here or anything?</p>
<p>So for those two, it really only matters when you're writing because they sound the same.</p>
<p>When you're speaking, you don't really have to think about it.</p>
<p>You're going to hear that it sounds the same when people are speaking.</p>
<p>When you say them, they will sound the same.</p>
<p>But when you go to write an email, when you are writing anything, that's when you do have to take a second and think about the sentence.</p>
<p>Is it being used as a noun or a verb?</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>being used as a noun or a verb.</p>
<p>And earlier when I said effect, I just said that so that you could hear the E, but yeah, we don't have people really, people don't really say effect, right?</p>
<p>What are the effects?</p>
<p>Yeah, it's interesting.</p>
<p>Sometimes when you say the, it'll sort of carry the effects.</p>
<p>It's a little bit.</p>
<p>The effects, it's just too hard for us to say.</p>
<p>And so we just don't effects.</p>
<p>Yes, All right.</p>
<p>Where do we go from here, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yeah, so this is what makes it really tricky is that these words both have a second meaning in English, much less common.</p>
<p>So 99% of the time that you hear effect or see it, it will be the two we already covered, right?</p>
<p>Effect as a verb, effect as a noun.</p>
<p>But this word, though it's a little less common, affect, spelled with an A, spelled the same, this meaning, and it is pronounced differently, affect.</p>
<p>This is a term used often in psychology that means the outward expression of feelings and emotions that can be observed by others.</p>
<p>So what is your affect?</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>observed by others.</p>
<p>So what is your affect?</p>
<p>It's like, do you look happy?</p>
<p>Do you look sad?</p>
<p>That's your affect.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So for example, the patient had a flat affect with almost no facial expression during the conversation.</p>
<p>So, you know, just nothing there, nothing happening.</p>
<p>Yeah, And there are these different adjectives, especially that psychologists will use to describe someone's affect, right?</p>
<p>A flat affect or, you know, a joyful affect where you can see the emotions.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Or what did you notice about her affect, right?</p>
<p>We're making observations here.</p>
<p>And I think it kind of throws people off when we have a flat affect because we're not used to that, right?</p>
<p>We talked about poker face, but I think this takes poker face to a whole other level, right?</p>
<p>Absolutely, right?</p>
<p>Usually in the US, in our faces, you can see our emotions in general.</p>
<p>We rarely have that flat affect unless we're intentionally trying to have a poker face.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>And then the next one, affect, spelled with an E. Does that also have a second meaning, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yes, it has a second meaning.</p>
<p>This one is a little more common.</p>
<p>This is</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>This one is a little more common.</p>
<p>This is the lighting, sound, scenery used in a play, a movie or a broadcast.</p>
<p>It is pronounced the same as the other effect.</p>
<p>It just has this other meaning.</p>
<p>You might say the effects in that film were spectacular.</p>
<p>Yeah, like special effects, right?</p>
<p>That kind of idea?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Or action films often have great special effects.</p>
<p>Yes, So you could say have great effects or have great special effects.</p>
<p>It means the same thing.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder how they do all those things.</p>
<p>Are people swinging from mountains and especially the big action movies?</p>
<p>How do they do all that stuff?</p>
<p>I love that now you can often look up videos where they have the green screen or it shows them with the outfits on for the CGI.</p>
<p>And you can kind of get the behind the scenes look at how it was made.</p>
<p>And it looks kind of crazy sometimes when it doesn't have all the effects there.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's wild.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Yes, but there are people that do their own stunts though, right?</p>
<p>Like they're stuntmen.</p>
<p>They still have people actually physically putting their lives in danger to create the scene, right?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>danger to create the scene, right?</p>
<p>Did you watch Fall Guy with Ryan Gosling?</p>
<p>I loved it so much.</p>
<p>I thought it was great.</p>
<p>And it was a good inside look into those stunt people, right?</p>
<p>Yep, 100%. That's exactly what I was thinking about actually.</p>
<p>All right, we'll take a quick break and then we'll get into a role play.</p>
<p>あなたが大好きな物語も、心を動かされた発明も、思わず嫉妬したアイデアも、すべて何もないところから始まった。真っさらな画面が静かに問いかける。あなたは何を思い描く?ひらめきはいつもMacから。詳しくはApple公式サイトで。 All right, Aubrey, we know our listeners love role plays, so let's do it.</p>
<p>Here we are at a corporate team building event.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>I'll start us off.</p>
<p>Do you think these team building events have much of an effect?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>I think</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>Oh yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>I feel like they affect how well we're able to work together.</p>
<p>That makes sense.</p>
<p>Oh hey, did you see the new Mission Impossible movie?</p>
<p>Yes, the effects in those films are so good.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>I love this.</p>
<p>So the first thing I want to point out is we didn't use affect because in this conversation it just wouldn't come up.</p>
<p>It's not common in everyday conversations.</p>
<p>I don't know that I've ever used it in a conversation, right?</p>
<p>We'll hear psychologists use this.</p>
<p>Every now and then we'll hear it on maybe a TV show or on a podcast, but it's usually you're referring to the psychology of something.</p>
<p>No, that's right.</p>
<p>Yeah, that doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>So we're not going to force that word in here.</p>
<p>It just doesn't work.</p>
<p>So the ones that do work though, I said, do you think these team building events have much of an effect?</p>
<p>Do they have any impact would be another way of saying that.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And that is with an E because it's the noun, right?</p>
<p>What is the effect of these team building events?</p>
<p>It's a noun in this sentence.</p>
<p>And then you said, or I said, what did I say?</p>
<p>Yeah, I feel like they affect how</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>Yeah, I feel like they affect how well we're able to work together.</p>
<p>And here it's a verb, so we write it with an A. They affect something.</p>
<p>They change how well we're able to work together.</p>
<p>And I think this is a very realistic conversation you're likely to have with your coworkers.</p>
<p>I know a lot of corporations will invest in having training companies come in and run team building events.</p>
<p>And a lot of people will roll their eyes, and there's always challenging, right?</p>
<p>Does this actually do anything?</p>
<p>Are we just wasting our time?</p>
<p>Or is it helping us?</p>
<p>I've been in this type of situation where a coworker is like, do you think this even works?</p>
<p>And I would be the one that's like, yes, I love these.</p>
<p>I think it's great.</p>
<p>The game person, right?</p>
<p>Because it's a fun activity, so I'm on board.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's cool.</p>
<p>That's cool.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Very authentic, right?</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>And then you said, that makes sense.</p>
<p>And then I said, oh, hey, did you see the new Mission Impossible movie?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And the response was?</p>
<p>The effects in those films are so good.</p>
<p>So you're talking about the lighting, the sound, the action.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>the action, the fire, whatever it is they're doing, those effects.</p>
<p>And they are in Mission Impossible movies.</p>
<p>I went to the newest one and it's amazing.</p>
<p>I loved it.</p>
<p>Yes, Or the Top Gun, the new Top Gun that came out a couple years ago.</p>
<p>Really good too, right?</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>Yes, Great effects.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Okay, so we flipped into the other meaning.</p>
<p>So that is likely to be in there too, right?</p>
<p>The effects, the special effects.</p>
<p>Aubrey, what else should we tell our listeners?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that's it.</p>
<p>It's really interesting.</p>
<p>We use these a lot.</p>
<p>Like in the average conversation, one of these, effect or effect or maybe both, might come up.</p>
<p>They're extremely common in English.</p>
<p>I think the good news is that you don't need to stress about which is which because when you're speaking, they sound the same.</p>
<p>So it isn't until you're writing that you want to take just a second to think about which to use.</p>
<p>If you put your writing through Grammarly or ChatGPT, that's something that they will catch for you.</p>
<p>So that's another.</p>
<p>There are tools that can help you make sure you're using the correct one as well.</p>
<p>Yes, and I know a lot of our listeners are probably using those tools.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>are probably using those tools now for your writing, Grammarly, ChatGPT, other kinds of AI, but don't turn off your brain, right?</p>
<p>Because we're still sending text messages at times.</p>
<p>There may still be times we need to know the difference, and we should want to know the difference, right?</p>
<p>So that's another question about how do we make sure AI doesn't turn off our brain entirely?</p>
<p>Good point.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>I'm not going to want to put every text into Grammarly, right?</p>
<p>And that's true.</p>
<p>These are common enough that you could end up texting or getting a text from someone.</p>
<p>So hopefully this mnemonic will help, Raven, right?</p>
<p>Remember, affect with an A is a verb, and effect with an E is a noun.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And go over to 2405.</p>
<p>That would have been just earlier this week.</p>
<p>Get sassy with this precise way to describe personality.</p>
<p>Yeah, Michelle and I had a great time recording that episode.</p>
