<p id="p-18">Hello, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-19">Happy Thursday.</p>
<p id="p-20">We're recording today on a Thursday.</p>
<p id="p-21">How's it going?</p>
<p id="p-22">Happy Thursday to you, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-23">Great.</p>
<p id="p-24">How are you?</p>
<p id="p-25">Good, good.</p>
<p id="p-26">Doing great.</p>
<p id="p-27">Aubrey, here's a question for you.</p>
<p id="p-28">You ready?</p>
<p id="p-29">Yeah, So I'm curious about your style.</p>
<p id="p-30">So when something doesn't go according to plan or your plan for that day, does it affect your mood or are you able to roll with it?</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-31">Or are you able to roll with it?</p>
<p id="p-32">What's your style?</p>
<p id="p-33">That is a great question.</p>
<p id="p-34">I feel like in general I'm able to roll with the punches, right?</p>
<p id="p-35">If something comes up, I don't really let it affect my mood, but it really depends.</p>
<p id="p-36">My mood is more affected by, like, my children's behavior.</p>
<p id="p-37">Or if something really terrible happens, if there were, like, a medical emergency and suddenly, that's probably going to affect my mood.</p>
<p id="p-38">But minor things, I don't think so.</p>
<p id="p-39">What about you?</p>
<p id="p-40">Well, I think that makes sense.</p>
<p id="p-41">Yeah, I think I might be a little more rigid than you are because, I mean, you have four kids.</p>
<p id="p-42">You've learned to be flexible.</p>
<p id="p-43">I've been forced.</p>
<p id="p-44">Yeah, you've been forced.</p>
<p id="p-45">You know the day's not going to go as you plan it, right?</p>
<p id="p-46">That's true.</p>
<p id="p-47">But no, I've always been a pretty laid-back person, especially when I travel.</p>
<p id="p-48">I'm definitely not rigid.</p>
<p id="p-49">I don't need certain things to happen.</p>
<p id="p-50">Sometimes you can have very serendipitous moments when you're traveling and something doesn't happen according to plan, right?</p>
<p id="p-51">That's smart when you're traveling to be able to be more spontaneous and take advantage of whatever might happen.</p>
<p id="p-52">I love that.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-53">Whatever might happen, I love that.</p>
<p id="p-54">This is interesting.</p>
<p id="p-55">You'll notice in the question Lindsay asked me, we have this verb affect.</p>
<p id="p-56">Does it affect your mood?</p>
<p id="p-57">We were asked a great question from YouTube, likely one that many of you either have or have thought about because affect and effect in English spelled differently, different meanings, sound exactly the same.</p>
<p id="p-58">So this is really tricky.</p>
<p id="p-59">Yeah, this is a good one.</p>
<p id="p-60">It's a classic question and a classic confusing point, right?</p>
<p id="p-61">So I'm going to go ahead and read our listener's question or our viewer's question.</p>
<p id="p-62">Shinar Ghafoor asks, thanks a lot for your lessons.</p>
<p id="p-63">I have a question.</p>
<p id="p-64">When should I use affect and when should I use effect?</p>
<p id="p-65">Right, And the first one with an A affect and the second one with an E effect.</p>
<p id="p-66">Yes, yes.</p>
<p id="p-67">And I do want to remind our listeners, we have an entire YouTube channel.</p>
<p id="p-68">So if you prefer to consume this show by video, that's an option for you.</p>

<p id="p-70">But if you prefer podcasts, hit follow.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-71">But if you prefer podcasts, hit follow on the podcast, all right?</p>
<p id="p-72">Yes, and that's a great place to leave us comments like this one.</p>
<p id="p-73">Leave us your questions.</p>
<p id="p-74">We get a lot of questions for the episodes there on YouTube.</p>
<p id="p-75">Yes, and we read them all.</p>
<p id="p-76">We put them in our big list.</p>
<p id="p-77">And if it's a good question, we feature it like this one.</p>
<p id="p-78">So let's dive into it, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-79">Yeah, so this is tricky.</p>
<p id="p-80">Unfortunately, these sound the same, which really makes it difficult when we're writing to know which to choose.</p>
<p id="p-81">We have to think about the meaning.</p>
<p id="p-82">So we're going to dive into that.</p>
<p id="p-83">And then we're going to share because these both do have different meanings, one of which is pronounced differently.</p>
<p id="p-84">So we're diving into all of that today.</p>
<p id="p-85">So stay to the end.</p>
<p id="p-86">Yeah, it sounds like a big plan here.</p>
<p id="p-87">All right, so let's start with the first one.</p>
<p id="p-88">Effect is a verb, right?</p>
<p id="p-89">What kind of effect are we talking about first, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-90">Yeah, so this is the verb.</p>
<p id="p-91">It starts with an A, A-F-F-E-C-T. This means to have an influence on someone or something.</p>
<p id="p-92">So like our conversation at the top of the episode, does what happens throughout the day</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-93">Does what happens throughout the day affect your mood?</p>
<p id="p-94">Because in that sentence, affect is a verb.</p>
<p id="p-95">Does it, you know, change your mood?</p>
<p id="p-96">Would it be altered?</p>
<p id="p-97">There we would spell it with an A, affect.</p>
<p id="p-98">Yeah, so how will this affect my day, like we said, or don't let it affect you.</p>
<p id="p-99">For example, if you're someone that reads the news and gets really thrown off, right, that could be hard right now.</p>
<p id="p-100">Exactly, right?</p>
<p id="p-101">It's hard to, I have to just avoid the news because it is going to affect me.</p>
<p id="p-102">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-103">So what affects you?</p>
<p id="p-104">This is really important to keep in mind.</p>
<p id="p-105">This is a verb, okay?</p>
<p id="p-106">And when you're writing, this is the best way to know how to spell it, which one to use.</p>
<p id="p-107">Because if you're just hearing it spoken, they sound exactly the same for most English speakers.</p>
<p id="p-108">I say them exactly the same.</p>
<p id="p-109">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-110">And then when it comes to the noun form, well, the noun word, it's a different word, right?</p>
<p id="p-111">We're not talking about forms here.</p>
<p id="p-112">It's an entirely different word.</p>
<p id="p-113">Effect with an E, yeah?</p>
<p id="p-114">But usually when we say it in a sentence, just sounds like affect.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-115">in a sentence, just sounds like a fact.</p>
<p id="p-116">So unfortunately, they sound the same.</p>
<p id="p-117">This is a change, which is a result or consequence of an action or another cause.</p>
<p id="p-118">So for example, what is the effect of long-term isolation?</p>
<p id="p-119">Good question.</p>
<p id="p-120">Very interesting.</p>
<p id="p-121">Smoking has many harmful effects, and we know that now based on science, right?</p>
<p id="p-122">Exactly, right?</p>
<p id="p-123">So for both of these, it would be written with an E, E-F-F-E-C-T. And when you're writing, and even native English speakers have to sometimes think of this as a common native error as well, because they sound the same.</p>
<p id="p-124">Sometimes you have to take just a second to think about how is this used in the sentence?</p>
<p id="p-125">Is it being used as a verb?</p>
<p id="p-126">Then it should be an A. Is it being used as a noun?</p>
<p id="p-127">Okay, then I write it with an E. Yeah, I mean, frankly, I still have to stop and think about it, right?</p>
<p id="p-128">I do too sometimes, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-129">I never make the mistake anymore.</p>
<p id="p-130">I used to, but I do have to stop and think, right?</p>
<p id="p-131">Okay, which one am I using now?</p>
<p id="p-132">So it's very normal to have to stop and think.</p>
<p id="p-133">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-134">Right, there is an...</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-135">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-136">There is a mnemonic you can use, right?</p>
<p id="p-137">So raven, R-A-V-E-N is like a blackbird, like a crow.</p>
<p id="p-138">And there's a mnemonic that uses the first letters of that word.</p>
<p id="p-139">It's remember that affect, with an A, is a verb and effect, with an E, is a noun.</p>
<p id="p-140">So you can go through if you're like trying to remember, okay, which was which?</p>
<p id="p-141">Can't remember.</p>
<p id="p-142">Raven, remember affect is a verb and effect is a noun.</p>
<p id="p-143">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-144">You just need to remember the kind of bird, right?</p>
<p id="p-145">That's a raven.</p>
<p id="p-146">Raven, raven.</p>
<p id="p-147">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-148">All right.</p>
<p id="p-149">What else do we need to know?</p>
<p id="p-150">Is there any caveat here or anything?</p>
<p id="p-151">So for those two, it really only matters when you're writing because they sound the same.</p>
<p id="p-152">When you're speaking, you don't really have to think about it.</p>
<p id="p-153">You're going to hear that it sounds the same when people are speaking.</p>
<p id="p-154">When you say them, they will sound the same.</p>
<p id="p-155">But when you go to write an email, when you are writing anything, that's when you do have to take a second and think about the sentence.</p>
<p id="p-156">Is it being used as a noun or a verb?</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-157">being used as a noun or a verb.</p>
<p id="p-158">And earlier when I said effect, I just said that so that you could hear the E, but yeah, we don't have people really, people don't really say effect, right?</p>
<p id="p-159">What are the effects?</p>
<p id="p-160">Yeah, it's interesting.</p>
<p id="p-161">Sometimes when you say the, it'll sort of carry the effects.</p>
<p id="p-162">It's a little bit.</p>
<p id="p-163">The effects, it's just too hard for us to say.</p>
<p id="p-164">And so we just don't effects.</p>
<p id="p-165">Yes, All right.</p>
<p id="p-166">Where do we go from here, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-167">Yeah, so this is what makes it really tricky is that these words both have a second meaning in English, much less common.</p>
<p id="p-168">So 99% of the time that you hear effect or see it, it will be the two we already covered, right?</p>
<p id="p-169">Effect as a verb, effect as a noun.</p>
<p id="p-170">But this word, though it's a little less common, affect, spelled with an A, spelled the same, this meaning, and it is pronounced differently, affect.</p>
<p id="p-171">This is a term used often in psychology that means the outward expression of feelings and emotions that can be observed by others.</p>
<p id="p-172">So what is your affect?</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-173">observed by others.</p>
<p id="p-174">So what is your affect?</p>
<p id="p-175">It's like, do you look happy?</p>
<p id="p-176">Do you look sad?</p>
<p id="p-177">That's your affect.</p>
<p id="p-178">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-179">So for example, the patient had a flat affect with almost no facial expression during the conversation.</p>
<p id="p-180">So, you know, just nothing there, nothing happening.</p>
<p id="p-181">Yeah, And there are these different adjectives, especially that psychologists will use to describe someone's affect, right?</p>
<p id="p-182">A flat affect or, you know, a joyful affect where you can see the emotions.</p>
<p id="p-183">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-184">Or what did you notice about her affect, right?</p>
<p id="p-185">We're making observations here.</p>
<p id="p-186">And I think it kind of throws people off when we have a flat affect because we're not used to that, right?</p>
<p id="p-187">We talked about poker face, but I think this takes poker face to a whole other level, right?</p>
<p id="p-188">Absolutely, right?</p>
<p id="p-189">Usually in the US, in our faces, you can see our emotions in general.</p>
<p id="p-190">We rarely have that flat affect unless we're intentionally trying to have a poker face.</p>
<p id="p-191">Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-192">And then the next one, affect, spelled with an E. Does that also have a second meaning, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-193">Yes, it has a second meaning.</p>
<p id="p-194">This one is a little more common.</p>
<p id="p-195">This is</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-196">This one is a little more common.</p>
<p id="p-197">This is the lighting, sound, scenery used in a play, a movie or a broadcast.</p>
<p id="p-198">It is pronounced the same as the other effect.</p>
<p id="p-199">It just has this other meaning.</p>
<p id="p-200">You might say the effects in that film were spectacular.</p>
<p id="p-201">Yeah, like special effects, right?</p>
<p id="p-202">That kind of idea?</p>
<p id="p-203">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-204">Or action films often have great special effects.</p>
<p id="p-205">Yes, So you could say have great effects or have great special effects.</p>
<p id="p-206">It means the same thing.</p>
<p id="p-207">Sometimes I wonder how they do all those things.</p>
<p id="p-208">Are people swinging from mountains and especially the big action movies?</p>
<p id="p-209">How do they do all that stuff?</p>
<p id="p-210">I love that now you can often look up videos where they have the green screen or it shows them with the outfits on for the CGI.</p>
<p id="p-211">And you can kind of get the behind the scenes look at how it was made.</p>
<p id="p-212">And it looks kind of crazy sometimes when it doesn't have all the effects there.</p>
<p id="p-213">Yeah, that's wild.</p>
<p id="p-214">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-215">Yes, but there are people that do their own stunts though, right?</p>
<p id="p-216">Like they're stuntmen.</p>
<p id="p-217">They still have people actually physically putting their lives in danger to create the scene, right?</p>
<p id="p-218">Absolutely.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-219">danger to create the scene, right?</p>
<p id="p-220">Did you watch Fall Guy with Ryan Gosling?</p>
<p id="p-221">I loved it so much.</p>
<p id="p-222">I thought it was great.</p>
<p id="p-223">And it was a good inside look into those stunt people, right?</p>
<p id="p-224">Yep, 100%. That's exactly what I was thinking about actually.</p>
<p id="p-225">All right, we'll take a quick break and then we'll get into a role play.</p>
<p id="p-226">あなたが大好きな物語も、心を動かされた発明も、思わず嫉妬したアイデアも、すべて何もないところから始まった。真っさらな画面が静かに問いかける。あなたは何を思い描く?ひらめきはいつもMacから。詳しくはApple公式サイトで。 All right, Aubrey, we know our listeners love role plays, so let's do it.</p>
<p id="p-227">Here we are at a corporate team building event.</p>
<p id="p-228">Okay?</p>
<p id="p-229">Awesome.</p>
<p id="p-230">I'll start us off.</p>
<p id="p-231">Do you think these team building events have much of an effect?</p>
<p id="p-232">Oh, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-233">I think</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-234">Oh yeah, I think so.</p>
<p id="p-235">I feel like they affect how well we're able to work together.</p>
<p id="p-236">That makes sense.</p>
<p id="p-237">Oh hey, did you see the new Mission Impossible movie?</p>
<p id="p-238">Yes, the effects in those films are so good.</p>
<p id="p-239">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-240">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-241">I love this.</p>
<p id="p-242">So the first thing I want to point out is we didn't use affect because in this conversation it just wouldn't come up.</p>
<p id="p-243">It's not common in everyday conversations.</p>
<p id="p-244">I don't know that I've ever used it in a conversation, right?</p>
<p id="p-245">We'll hear psychologists use this.</p>
<p id="p-246">Every now and then we'll hear it on maybe a TV show or on a podcast, but it's usually you're referring to the psychology of something.</p>
<p id="p-247">No, that's right.</p>
<p id="p-248">Yeah, that doesn't make sense.</p>
<p id="p-249">So we're not going to force that word in here.</p>
<p id="p-250">It just doesn't work.</p>
<p id="p-251">So the ones that do work though, I said, do you think these team building events have much of an effect?</p>
<p id="p-252">Do they have any impact would be another way of saying that.</p>
<p id="p-253">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-254">And that is with an E because it's the noun, right?</p>
<p id="p-255">What is the effect of these team building events?</p>
<p id="p-256">It's a noun in this sentence.</p>
<p id="p-257">And then you said, or I said, what did I say?</p>
<p id="p-258">Yeah, I feel like they affect how</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-259">Yeah, I feel like they affect how well we're able to work together.</p>
<p id="p-260">And here it's a verb, so we write it with an A. They affect something.</p>
<p id="p-261">They change how well we're able to work together.</p>
<p id="p-262">And I think this is a very realistic conversation you're likely to have with your coworkers.</p>
<p id="p-263">I know a lot of corporations will invest in having training companies come in and run team building events.</p>
<p id="p-264">And a lot of people will roll their eyes, and there's always challenging, right?</p>
<p id="p-265">Does this actually do anything?</p>
<p id="p-266">Are we just wasting our time?</p>
<p id="p-267">Or is it helping us?</p>
<p id="p-268">I've been in this type of situation where a coworker is like, do you think this even works?</p>
<p id="p-269">And I would be the one that's like, yes, I love these.</p>
<p id="p-270">I think it's great.</p>
<p id="p-271">The game person, right?</p>
<p id="p-272">Because it's a fun activity, so I'm on board.</p>
<p id="p-273">Yeah, that's cool.</p>
<p id="p-274">That's cool.</p>
<p id="p-275">I like it.</p>
<p id="p-276">Very authentic, right?</p>
<p id="p-277">Great.</p>
<p id="p-278">And then you said, that makes sense.</p>
<p id="p-279">And then I said, oh, hey, did you see the new Mission Impossible movie?</p>
<p id="p-280">Right?</p>
<p id="p-281">And the response was?</p>
<p id="p-282">The effects in those films are so good.</p>
<p id="p-283">So you're talking about the lighting, the sound, the action.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-284">the action, the fire, whatever it is they're doing, those effects.</p>
<p id="p-285">And they are in Mission Impossible movies.</p>
<p id="p-286">I went to the newest one and it's amazing.</p>
<p id="p-287">I loved it.</p>
<p id="p-288">Yes, Or the Top Gun, the new Top Gun that came out a couple years ago.</p>
<p id="p-289">Really good too, right?</p>
<p id="p-290">So good.</p>
<p id="p-291">Yes, Great effects.</p>
<p id="p-292">Great.</p>
<p id="p-293">Okay, so we flipped into the other meaning.</p>
<p id="p-294">So that is likely to be in there too, right?</p>
<p id="p-295">The effects, the special effects.</p>
<p id="p-296">Aubrey, what else should we tell our listeners?</p>
<p id="p-297">Yeah, I think that's it.</p>
<p id="p-298">It's really interesting.</p>
<p id="p-299">We use these a lot.</p>
<p id="p-300">Like in the average conversation, one of these, effect or effect or maybe both, might come up.</p>
<p id="p-301">They're extremely common in English.</p>
<p id="p-302">I think the good news is that you don't need to stress about which is which because when you're speaking, they sound the same.</p>
<p id="p-303">So it isn't until you're writing that you want to take just a second to think about which to use.</p>
<p id="p-304">If you put your writing through Grammarly or ChatGPT, that's something that they will catch for you.</p>
<p id="p-305">So that's another.</p>
<p id="p-306">There are tools that can help you make sure you're using the correct one as well.</p>
<p id="p-307">Yes, and I know a lot of our listeners are probably using those tools.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-308">are probably using those tools now for your writing, Grammarly, ChatGPT, other kinds of AI, but don't turn off your brain, right?</p>
<p id="p-309">Because we're still sending text messages at times.</p>
<p id="p-310">There may still be times we need to know the difference, and we should want to know the difference, right?</p>
<p id="p-311">So that's another question about how do we make sure AI doesn't turn off our brain entirely?</p>
<p id="p-312">Good point.</p>
<p id="p-313">That's true.</p>
<p id="p-314">I'm not going to want to put every text into Grammarly, right?</p>
<p id="p-315">And that's true.</p>
<p id="p-316">These are common enough that you could end up texting or getting a text from someone.</p>
<p id="p-317">So hopefully this mnemonic will help, Raven, right?</p>
<p id="p-318">Remember, affect with an A is a verb, and effect with an E is a noun.</p>
<p id="p-319">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-320">And go over to 2405.</p>
