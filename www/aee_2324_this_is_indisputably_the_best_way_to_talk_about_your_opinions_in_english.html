<p id="p-8">When you are asked about your opinion, there are a lot of fun vocabulary phrases</p>
<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p id="p-9">a lot of fun vocabulary phrases that you can add to emphasize that you're confident in your stance.</p>
<p id="p-10">Listen in today to find out what they are in English.</p>
<p id="p-11">I'm going to ask you this question because you may have a stronger perspective.</p>
<p id="p-12">What do you think is hands down the best TV show of all time?</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-13">best TV show of all time?</p>
<p id="p-14">I think I know what you're going to say.</p>
<p id="p-15">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-16">So no, you may think you know, but I, Hmm.</p>
<p id="p-17">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-18">So a long time ago, I remember there was an actual countdown.</p>
<p id="p-19">It was a special TV special and they, they talked about what is the best show of all time?</p>
<p id="p-20">And do you want to know what it was?</p>
<p id="p-21">What was it?</p>
<p id="p-22">It was Seinfeld.</p>
<p id="p-23">Ah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-24">So yeah, this is, I thought, and I remember my mom was angry because she loves Seinfeld too, but she thought that I love Lucy was actually the best show of all time.</p>
<p id="p-25">Um, so that that was, it was, it had more recently we talked about, um, you know, staying power, standing the test of time.</p>
<p id="p-26">Right, So she felt that that was just such more of a classic and</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-27">more of a classic.</p>
<p id="p-28">And just so she was she even though she loved Seinfeld.</p>
<p id="p-29">So I think that TV shows are just different in what their strengths are.</p>
<p id="p-30">And obviously, I love Friends, too.</p>
<p id="p-31">But I, I don't think it's the best show of all time.</p>
<p id="p-32">It's my favorite.</p>
<p id="p-33">But I would say Seinfeld is the better show.</p>
<p id="p-34">That's how I feel.</p>
<p id="p-35">For sure.</p>
<p id="p-36">Now that makes sense.</p>
<p id="p-37">I could see how your mom was feeling upset because maybe at that time when this ranking was done, Seinfeld was still kind of new or trendy or current.</p>
<p id="p-38">But I Love Lucy is so classic.</p>
<p id="p-39">It's one of the most famous shows of all time.</p>
<p id="p-40">So I can I can get how she was feeling.</p>
<p id="p-41">I get it.</p>
<p id="p-42">Did you watch I Love Lucy?</p>
<p id="p-43">Or did you?</p>
<p id="p-44">I've seen a few episodes maybe in the past or links clips to them.</p>
<p id="p-45">But no, I never got into it.</p>
<p id="p-46">But Seinfeld.</p>
<p id="p-47">Yeah, I mean, Seinfeld is a piece of work for sure.</p>
<p id="p-48">Yeah, Piece of art, a piece of art.</p>
<p id="p-49">It is it really is.</p>
<p id="p-50">So today we're gonna answer a great</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-51">And today we are going to answer a great listener question dealing with this expression, hands down.</p>
<p id="p-52">And this is from Sophia.</p>
<p id="p-53">Lindsay, would you like to read the question?</p>
<p id="p-54">I would love to, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-55">We love our listener questions.</p>
<p id="p-56">So here we go.</p>
<p id="p-57">Hey, All Ears English team.</p>
<p id="p-58">I'm Sophia.</p>
<p id="p-59">Just wanted to say thanks for all the awesome content you guys put out.</p>
<p id="p-60">I have a quick question about the phrase, hands down.</p>
<p id="p-61">Could you break it down for me with some examples?</p>
<p id="p-62">Thank you so much.</p>
<p id="p-63">Best, Sophia.</p>
<p id="p-64">What a great question.</p>
<p id="p-65">Great.</p>
<p id="p-66">Very specific.</p>
<p id="p-67">Really great question.</p>
<p id="p-68">Thank you, Sophia.</p>
<p id="p-69">Guys, make sure that you hit the follow button to make sure that you never miss any episodes from us.</p>
<p id="p-70">We also do bonus episodes that you'll get notifications for.</p>
<p id="p-71">So make it easy.</p>
<p id="p-72">Get the episode sent to you every day with a little bow.</p>
<p id="p-73">It'll be great.</p>
<p id="p-74">Yeah, You got it.</p>
<p id="p-75">You got it.</p>
<p id="p-76">And Michelle, we did attack this question, this phrase, from a different angle a long time ago.</p>
<p id="p-77">And we're coming back for another round today with a very different episode today.</p>
<p id="p-78">But our listeners could go back.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-79">But our listeners could go back after they finish up today and check out the other episode.</p>
<p id="p-80">And what was that?</p>
<p id="p-81">What number was that?</p>
<p id="p-82">All the way back.</p>
<p id="p-83">So guys, this is episode 23, 24.</p>
<p id="p-84">That was over a thousand episodes ago, 1138 was one handy phrase to show confidence in your suggestions.</p>
<p id="p-85">So that's a long time ago, but I actually do remember that one.</p>
<p id="p-86">I remember all of them, Michelle, all of them.</p>
<p id="p-87">I think the best way to get to this episode, by the way, guys, is to go to AllEarsEnglish.com and type in 1138 in the search bar.</p>
<p id="p-88">That's the best way to find it.</p>
<p id="p-89">It will take too long to scroll down.</p>
<p id="p-90">So absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-91">So go ahead and listen to that one.</p>
<p id="p-92">So today we're going to answer your question because it's been over a thousand episodes, but we're going to give you also some new ways to share a similar idea, ones that were not done on the previous episode.</p>
<p id="p-93">So you definitely do want to listen to that one to get kind of the basics.</p>
<p id="p-94">So basically, what does hands down mean, Lindsay?</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-95">What does hands down mean, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-96">All right.</p>
<p id="p-97">So it means to basically say that you feel a certain way and you are confident in your opinion without question, and there's no competition.</p>
<p id="p-98">There's no questioning it.</p>
<p id="p-99">You are sure.</p>
<p id="p-100">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-101">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-102">Yeah, Yep.</p>
<p id="p-103">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-104">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-105">So if we say, that movie was the best comedy I've seen all year.</p>
<p id="p-106">Hands down.</p>
<p id="p-107">Lindsay asked me, what do you think is hands down the best TV show of all time?</p>
<p id="p-108">Yeah, Yeah, It's interesting where it comes from.</p>
<p id="p-109">What does hands up mean?</p>
<p id="p-110">Like, is that challenging the suggestion or the winning item?</p>
<p id="p-111">What does that even mean?</p>
<p id="p-112">We don't have the etymology today, but our listeners could look it up.</p>
<p id="p-113">Guys, you can always go.</p>
<p id="p-114">And we also don't say hands up.</p>
<p id="p-115">Like that's hands up, right?</p>
<p id="p-116">Yeah, No, we don't. We don't. But, but, but think about it, guys.</p>
<p id="p-117">If you're watching us on YouTube, Lindsay, what about when people go, like, wait, hold on.</p>
<p id="p-118">Hold on.</p>
<p id="p-119">I'm not seeing you.</p>
<p id="p-120">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-121">Hands up.</p>
<p id="p-122">Oh.</p>
<p id="p-123">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-124">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-125">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-126">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-127">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-128">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-129">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-130">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-131">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-132">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-133">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-134">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-135">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-136">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-137">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-138">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-139">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-140">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-141">Okay.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-142">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-143">Hands up.</p>
<p id="p-144">Oh, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-145">Could it could be that?</p>
<p id="p-146">I mean, like a shrug, right?</p>
<p id="p-147">It could it could be that I'm thinking maybe it could just be like a unanimous vote.</p>
<p id="p-148">No one's. Oh, that doesn't make sense, though, because it would be hands up.</p>
<p id="p-149">Everyone's voting for it.</p>
<p id="p-150">That makes no sense.</p>
<p id="p-151">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-152">Well, all we know is, you know, my hands are out of the picture.</p>
<p id="p-153">I'm thinking like when you shrug and you're like, I don't know, right?</p>
<p id="p-154">So maybe that's hands up.</p>
<p id="p-155">So anyway, well, whatever.</p>
<p id="p-156">Who knows?</p>
<p id="p-157">But this is an important even though we don't know exactly where it comes from or why this phrase was created.</p>
<p id="p-158">We don't need to know that to use it to connect.</p>
<p id="p-159">Right, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-160">Yeah, Yeah, So today we're going to talk about additional ways you can express a confident opinion.</p>
<p id="p-161">And these were not used in the other episode, like I said.</p>
<p id="p-162">So, Lindsay, what's the first word we can use?</p>
<p id="p-163">I like this easily.</p>
<p id="p-164">So for example, this is easily the best chocolate cake I've ever had.</p>
<p id="p-165">Yes, Hmm.</p>
<p id="p-166">I love chocolate lava cake.</p>
<p id="p-167">I love it when the lava's in the middle.</p>
<p id="p-168">Oh.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-169">it when the love is in the middle.</p>
<p id="p-170">Gooey and warm.</p>
<p id="p-171">So good.</p>
<p id="p-172">So good.</p>
<p id="p-173">Next one's really high level.</p>
<p id="p-174">Yes, this is a high level one guys.</p>
<p id="p-175">So indisputably, I'll say it again, indisputably.</p>
<p id="p-176">This one is going to be great for our high level C1 students who just joined our C1 course.</p>
<p id="p-177">Everyone, if you're in that course, I want you to write this one down because this is advanced English.</p>
<p id="p-178">This will get you a band seven or higher on IELTS.</p>
<p id="p-179">It is fantastic.</p>
<p id="p-180">Articulate.</p>
<p id="p-181">Yeah, So what's an example?</p>
<p id="p-182">How would we use indisputably?</p>
<p id="p-183">We are indisputably much better at sales calls than the other team.</p>
<p id="p-184">It's a mouthful.</p>
<p id="p-185">I will say that word is a mouthful.</p>
<p id="p-186">Indisputably.</p>
<p id="p-187">Yeah, So if something is indisputable, it can't be disputed.</p>
<p id="p-188">It can't be argued the other way.</p>
<p id="p-189">There's no argument.</p>
<p id="p-190">This is what it is.</p>
<p id="p-191">So it is the same idea as hands down, but so much more high level.</p>
<p id="p-192">Yeah, I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-193">There are times when we need.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-194">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-195">There are times when we need a more articulate phrase, a more formal-sounding articulate phrase and it depends on who you're in front of and who you're talking to.</p>
<p id="p-196">Maybe you're in a job interview and you're using this to talk about your numbers in your last company that you achieved for your sales department, right?</p>
<p id="p-197">We had indisputably the best sales team in the entire region, right?</p>
<p id="p-198">But in front of your friends, maybe you're not going to worry about that deeper vocabulary.</p>
<p id="p-199">You're just going to use something like easily.</p>
<p id="p-200">We easily had the best sales team.</p>
<p id="p-201">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-202">Yeah, Yeah, Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-203">Yeah, So the next one is by a mile.</p>
<p id="p-204">So this one is slightly different, but similar idea.</p>
<p id="p-205">So you could say, I like living here much more than my old place by a mile.</p>
<p id="p-206">So you're just saying the intensity with which you like it is big.</p>
<p id="p-207">Yeah, Right?</p>
<p id="p-208">Right, Yeah, But here, maybe I'm stressing more the intensity.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-209">assessing more the intensity or comparison.</p>
<p id="p-210">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-211">Okay, Michelle, we are back.</p>
<p id="p-212">Another one we could say is what?</p>
<p id="p-213">So have you ever heard this one?</p>
<p id="p-214">This is when I was doing research and I saw this and this is adorable.</p>
<p id="p-215">No, this is totally new for me.</p>
<p id="p-216">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-217">I kept on coming up in my research that's as sure as eggs is eggs.</p>
<p id="p-218">As sure as egg.</p>
<p id="p-219">That's even not even correct grammar.</p>
<p id="p-220">I know I'm looking it up again here.</p>
<p id="p-221">Yeah, Wow.</p>
<p id="p-222">This is sure.</p>
<p id="p-223">Yeah, Yeah, Hold on.</p>
<p id="p-224">Let me look at as sure as eggs.</p>
<p id="p-225">Yeah, as sure as eggs.</p>
<p id="p-226">And apparently it's a song to as sure as egg.</p>
<p id="p-227">Gosh, this might be more British.</p>
<p id="p-228">So it says the definition says British English without any doubt.</p>
<p id="p-229">Okay, love it.</p>
<p id="p-230">So as who I would challenge our listeners.</p>
<p id="p-231">Ask a British English speaker about this phrase, right?</p>
<p id="p-232">Ask them about it.</p>
<p id="p-233">And they can very cute.</p>
<p id="p-234">Yeah, we just want to build your awareness that it exists.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-235">awareness that it exists.</p>
<p id="p-236">But yeah, here we focus mostly on American English, but ask, this is a conversation starter.</p>
<p id="p-237">Right?</p>
<p id="p-238">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-239">It's fun.</p>
<p id="p-240">And then we'll do one more, which is irrefutably.</p>
<p id="p-241">So the other one was indisputably.</p>
<p id="p-242">Here we have irrefutably.</p>
<p id="p-243">This could make a poem here.</p>
<p id="p-244">These terms rhyme.</p>
<p id="p-245">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-246">And they're both mouthfuls.</p>
<p id="p-247">They're both C1 level, high level vocabulary.</p>
<p id="p-248">She is irrefutably our strongest employee.</p>
<p id="p-249">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-250">Wow.</p>
<p id="p-251">If our listeners can get some of these high level vocabulary words in their back pocket, very useful.</p>
<p id="p-252">Don't you think?</p>
<p id="p-253">Yeah, Oh, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-254">Lindsay, which one of these do you feel most connected to?</p>
<p id="p-255">Which is your favorite?</p>
<p id="p-256">I like easily.</p>
<p id="p-257">I use easily a lot.</p>
<p id="p-258">You know, this is easily the best chocolate cake I've ever had.</p>
<p id="p-259">I easily live in the best neighborhood in Denver, right?</p>
<p id="p-260">Obviously that's my opinion, but I like to express my opinion in a strong, definitive way.</p>
<p id="p-261">Otherwise, what's the point of having an opinion?</p>
<p id="p-262">Exactly.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-263">opinion.</p>
<p id="p-264">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-265">Be confident in your opinions.</p>
<p id="p-266">Lindsay, just before we start to head out and do a role play, let's do a couple of conversation questions.</p>
<p id="p-267">So let's try and use a word in each one.</p>
<p id="p-268">Wow.</p>
<p id="p-269">Okay, good.</p>
<p id="p-270">Fun.</p>
<p id="p-271">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-272">So, Michelle, what is your favorite sport?</p>
<p id="p-273">Oh, my favorite sport is basketball, hands down.</p>
<p id="p-274">I actually just took my son to a Knicks game and that was really fun last week.</p>
<p id="p-275">Oh, very nice.</p>
<p id="p-276">What about you?</p>
<p id="p-277">Well, for me, skiing is easily my go-to sport because it's the way I want to spend my time on the weekend with my family, you know, outdoors.</p>
<p id="p-278">Yeah, So it's easily the best.</p>
<p id="p-279">Easily the best for you.</p>
<p id="p-280">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-281">Lindsay, what is the most rewarding part about your career?</p>
<p id="p-282">Wow.</p>
<p id="p-283">Indisputably, it is exactly what we're doing right now, Michelle, recording the podcast.</p>
<p id="p-284">Actually, that's true.</p>
<p id="p-285">That's true.</p>
<p id="p-286">Yeah, it's true.</p>
<p id="p-287">It's my favorite.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-288">That's true.</p>
<p id="p-289">That's true.</p>
<p id="p-290">Yeah, It's true.</p>
<p id="p-291">It's my favorite thing about what we do at Allure.</p>
<p id="p-292">We do so many things.</p>
<p id="p-293">We build courses.</p>
<p id="p-294">We do marketing.</p>
<p id="p-295">We do so much here.</p>
<p id="p-296">But it actually comes down to just being on the microphone.</p>
<p id="p-297">Yeah, I love it too.</p>
<p id="p-298">Yeah, Irrefutably, it's my favorite part as well.</p>
<p id="p-299">And just also, you know, hearing from our listeners, just knowing that, you know, like we had that reviewer, Amir, who had said that we are his fuel.</p>
<p id="p-300">I mean, that to me, that's indisputably when I hear that.</p>
<p id="p-301">Yeah, It's huge.</p>
<p id="p-302">Yeah, We're very heart-centered here at Allure's English.</p>
<p id="p-303">Yes, Aren't we?</p>
<p id="p-304">Yeah, we are for sure.</p>
<p id="p-305">And that comes to the next question, is who is the best singer of all time?</p>
<p id="p-306">I know who you're going to say.</p>
<p id="p-307">Yeah, I know who you're going to say.</p>
<p id="p-308">You know it.</p>
<p id="p-309">You know it.</p>
<p id="p-310">Yeah, Oh, sure.</p>
<p id="p-311">You answer, though, first, please.</p>
<p id="p-312">See, this... Okay.</p>
<p id="p-313">So, the best singer of all time.</p>
<p id="p-314">All right.</p>
<p id="p-315">You know what?</p>
<p id="p-316">I'm going to... I'll agree with you.</p>
<p id="p-317">I know what you're going to say.</p>
<p id="p-318">All right.</p>
<p id="p-319">One, two, three.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-320">time.</p>
<p id="p-321">One, two, three, hands down Whitney Houston.</p>
<p id="p-322">I wasn't sure if you were going to say Adele, if you thought I was going to say Adele, but no.</p>
<p id="p-323">Adele is somewhere in the top five, I think.</p>
<p id="p-324">But hands down, Whitney Houston's a great, oh, Freddie, Freddie, what's her name?</p>
<p id="p-325">Freddie Mercury.</p>
<p id="p-326">Freddie Mercury could be in there somewhere too.</p>
<p id="p-327">Incredible.</p>
<p id="p-328">Well, Mariah Carey, not so much anymore, but she was amazing.</p>
<p id="p-329">And then I still think Whitney takes the top, takes the top spot.</p>
<p id="p-330">Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p id="p-331">Nowadays, I would say also Kelly Clarkson has moved up there.</p>
<p id="p-332">Really interesting.</p>
<p id="p-333">Yeah, I mean, that's, I think she's thought of as having one of the best.</p>
<p id="p-334">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-335">So, I mean, what I love about today's episode and these phrases is that we can, this is another way to assert who you are, right?</p>
<p id="p-336">Another really useful way to say, yes, hands down, I live in the best neighborhood in Denver.</p>
<p id="p-337">That means I like to walk, I like an urban environment.</p>
<p id="p-338">That says so much about me as a person, more than in my opinion, it shows so much more than just what you're</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-339">knows so much more than just what you're saying.</p>
<p id="p-340">Yeah, Whitney Houston, right?</p>
<p id="p-341">So there's so much that you can say by being strong when you deliver your opinion.</p>
<p id="p-342">Yeah, It just makes it.</p>
<p id="p-343">Yeah, It's a different sound when you add it.</p>
<p id="p-344">It gives a different feeling, this feeling of confidence when you can add in one of these.</p>
<p id="p-345">So should we do a role play?</p>
<p id="p-346">Yeah, let's do it.</p>
<p id="p-347">So here we are friends talking about what we'll do over the weekend.</p>
<p id="p-348">All right.</p>
<p id="p-349">We're not going to use all of them today, but we'll use a bunch.</p>
<p id="p-350">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-351">All right.</p>
<p id="p-352">All right.</p>
<p id="p-353">So where should we go for brunch?</p>
<p id="p-354">Oh, we have to try jelly toast.</p>
<p id="p-355">I've heard it has the best brunch in town.</p>
<p id="p-356">Hands down.</p>
<p id="p-357">Oh, really?</p>
<p id="p-358">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-359">Hopefully we can get a reservation.</p>
<p id="p-360">I'll give them a call.</p>
<p id="p-361">What should we do after that?</p>
<p id="p-362">We have to check out the new Tom Hanks movie.</p>
<p id="p-363">He's easily the best actor of our time.</p>
<p id="p-364">Agreed.</p>
<p id="p-365">By a mile.</p>
<p id="p-366">Wasn't he in a movie, The Green Mile?</p>
<p id="p-367">Oh, that's true.</p>
<p id="p-368">Yeah, The Green Mile.</p>
<p id="p-369">Yeah, That's kind of a little pun there, Rochelle.</p>
<p id="p-370">That's true.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-371">a little pun there, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-372">That's true.</p>
<p id="p-373">That's true.</p>
<p id="p-374">I cut on fun.</p>
<p id="p-375">All right, cool.</p>
<p id="p-376">So that's funny because there is a brunch or a breakfast restaurant in my neighborhood called Jelly.</p>
<p id="p-377">So that's fine.</p>
<p id="p-378">Get out of here.</p>
<p id="p-379">Yeah, right down the street.</p>
<p id="p-380">Yeah, Oh, well, I have the most fun for a role plays coming up with names of restaurants and stores.</p>
<p id="p-381">So yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-382">Oh, that's so funny.</p>
<p id="p-383">That is weird.</p>
<p id="p-384">But I'm not a brunch person.</p>
<p id="p-385">Yeah, It's a brunch spot, though.</p>
<p id="p-386">Um, it's it's not a bougie brunch spot.</p>
<p id="p-387">It's more of a breakfast spot.</p>
<p id="p-388">Like you walk in, it's pretty cool.</p>
<p id="p-389">They have the walls covered in old school cereal boxes from the 90s.</p>
<p id="p-390">Oh, fun.</p>
<p id="p-391">You know, but it's not a place like you're going to wait in line.</p>
<p id="p-392">It's a place to be seen.</p>
<p id="p-393">It's not like that.</p>
<p id="p-394">Well, a lot of brunch places are like that.</p>
<p id="p-395">Right, Right, Right, Right, It's more casual.</p>
<p id="p-396">It's more give more of a diner feeling to it.</p>
<p id="p-397">Oh, I love that.</p>
<p id="p-398">Oh, I love that.</p>
<p id="p-399">Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Cool.</p>
<p id="p-400">So.</p>
<p id="p-401">All right.</p>
<p id="p-402">So I said you said we have to try jelly toast.</p>
<p id="p-403">I've heard it has the best brunch in town.</p>
<p id="p-404">Hands down.</p>
<p id="p-405">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-406">And then</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-407">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-408">And then you suggested seeing the new Tom Hanks movie and you said he is easily the best actor of our time.</p>
<p id="p-409">Mm hmm.</p>
<p id="p-410">And then I'm totally on board with that statement.</p>
<p id="p-411">And I say agreed by a mile, right?</p>
<p id="p-412">By a green mile now.</p>
<p id="p-413">By a green mile.</p>
<p id="p-414">Yeah, Cool, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-415">So where should our listeners go?</p>
<p id="p-416">Remind them about that other episode?</p>
<p id="p-417">What is that number?</p>
<p id="p-418">Right, So that's 1138.</p>
<p id="p-419">So that's one handy phrase to show confidence in your suggestion.</p>
<p id="p-420">So to get more on this topic, definitely listen to that episode.</p>
<p id="p-421">And what's our takeaway today?</p>
<p id="p-422">This is a great way to connect with people because you're showing confidence.</p>
<p id="p-423">You're showing that you have a strong opinion.</p>
<p id="p-424">And it's just a good way to either share that opinion with someone or to agree with them.</p>
<p id="p-425">Right, Yeah, And I would also say reserve this for when you feel very strongly about your opinion.</p>
<p id="p-426">Don't say it for everything.</p>
<p id="p-427">You know, if you don't know very much about a topic or for</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p id="p-428">you don't know very much about a topic or right kind of on the fence, it just doesn't feel right using these definitive statements.</p>
<p id="p-429">But when you do feel strongly and you want to say something a bit more about, you know that this could say something about you too, and your taste and your knowledge, right?</p>
<p id="p-430">It can be a really powerful tool to show people who you are.</p>
<p id="p-431">And not to bring something up at the very end of the episode, but I'm going to.</p>
<p id="p-432">Do you think I feel I'm just noticing hands down to me, it sounds more when you're talking about things being good.</p>
<p id="p-433">Like, do you say that's the worst?</p>
<p id="p-434">The worst stake I've ever had?</p>
<p id="p-435">Hands down?</p>
<p id="p-436">I guess you could.</p>
<p id="p-437">Hmm.</p>
<p id="p-438">I think it's usually Yeah, it's usually about like, again, like people being the being the best people have voted for it.</p>
<p id="p-439">Yeah, like, to me, it's more positive sounding.</p>
<p id="p-440">I would say a lot of these Yeah, but some of these can go the other way, right?</p>
<p id="p-441">Right, Yeah, doubly or indisputably.</p>
<p id="p-442">Right, We're exactly the worst.</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p id="p-443">Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-444">The worst.</p>
<p id="p-445">Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-446">So, it doesn't... We leave hands down for the positive things.</p>
<p id="p-447">Yeah, That's what I think.</p>
<p id="p-448">I think that's fair.</p>
<p id="p-449">I think that's fair.</p>
<p id="p-450">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-451">All right.</p>
