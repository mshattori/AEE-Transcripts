<p>When you are asked about your opinion, there are a lot of fun vocabulary phrases</p>
<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p>a lot of fun vocabulary phrases that you can add to emphasize that you're confident in your stance.</p>
<p>Listen in today to find out what they are in English.</p>
<p>I'm going to ask you this question because you may have a stronger perspective.</p>
<p>What do you think is hands down the best TV show of all time?</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>best TV show of all time?</p>
<p>I think I know what you're going to say.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So no, you may think you know, but I, Hmm.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So a long time ago, I remember there was an actual countdown.</p>
<p>It was a special TV special and they, they talked about what is the best show of all time?</p>
<p>And do you want to know what it was?</p>
<p>What was it?</p>
<p>It was Seinfeld.</p>
<p>Ah, yeah.</p>
<p>So yeah, this is, I thought, and I remember my mom was angry because she loves Seinfeld too, but she thought that I love Lucy was actually the best show of all time.</p>
<p>Um, so that that was, it was, it had more recently we talked about, um, you know, staying power, standing the test of time.</p>
<p>Right, So she felt that that was just such more of a classic and</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>more of a classic.</p>
<p>And just so she was she even though she loved Seinfeld.</p>
<p>So I think that TV shows are just different in what their strengths are.</p>
<p>And obviously, I love Friends, too.</p>
<p>But I, I don't think it's the best show of all time.</p>
<p>It's my favorite.</p>
<p>But I would say Seinfeld is the better show.</p>
<p>That's how I feel.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>Now that makes sense.</p>
<p>I could see how your mom was feeling upset because maybe at that time when this ranking was done, Seinfeld was still kind of new or trendy or current.</p>
<p>But I Love Lucy is so classic.</p>
<p>It's one of the most famous shows of all time.</p>
<p>So I can I can get how she was feeling.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>Did you watch I Love Lucy?</p>
<p>Or did you?</p>
<p>I've seen a few episodes maybe in the past or links clips to them.</p>
<p>But no, I never got into it.</p>
<p>But Seinfeld.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, Seinfeld is a piece of work for sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, Piece of art, a piece of art.</p>
<p>It is it really is.</p>
<p>So today we're gonna answer a great</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>And today we are going to answer a great listener question dealing with this expression, hands down.</p>
<p>And this is from Sophia.</p>
<p>Lindsay, would you like to read the question?</p>
<p>I would love to, Michelle.</p>
<p>We love our listener questions.</p>
<p>So here we go.</p>
<p>Hey, All Ears English team.</p>
<p>I'm Sophia.</p>
<p>Just wanted to say thanks for all the awesome content you guys put out.</p>
<p>I have a quick question about the phrase, hands down.</p>
<p>Could you break it down for me with some examples?</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Best, Sophia.</p>
<p>What a great question.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Very specific.</p>
<p>Really great question.</p>
<p>Thank you, Sophia.</p>
<p>Guys, make sure that you hit the follow button to make sure that you never miss any episodes from us.</p>

<p>So make it easy.</p>
<p>Get the episode sent to you every day with a little bow.</p>
<p>It'll be great.</p>
<p>Yeah, You got it.</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>And Michelle, we did attack this question, this phrase, from a different angle a long time ago.</p>
<p>And we're coming back for another round today with a very different episode today.</p>
<p>But our listeners could go back.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>But our listeners could go back after they finish up today and check out the other episode.</p>
<p>And what was that?</p>
<p>What number was that?</p>
<p>All the way back.</p>
<p>So guys, this is episode 23, 24.</p>
<p>That was over a thousand episodes ago, 1138 was one handy phrase to show confidence in your suggestions.</p>
<p>So that's a long time ago, but I actually do remember that one.</p>
<p>I remember all of them, Michelle, all of them.</p>
<p>I think the best way to get to this episode, by the way, guys, is to go to AllEarsEnglish.com and type in 1138 in the search bar.</p>
<p>That's the best way to find it.</p>
<p>It will take too long to scroll down.</p>
<p>So absolutely.</p>
<p>So go ahead and listen to that one.</p>
<p>So today we're going to answer your question because it's been over a thousand episodes, but we're going to give you also some new ways to share a similar idea, ones that were not done on the previous episode.</p>
<p>So you definitely do want to listen to that one to get kind of the basics.</p>
<p>So basically, what does hands down mean, Lindsay?</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>What does hands down mean, Lindsay?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So it means to basically say that you feel a certain way and you are confident in your opinion without question, and there's no competition.</p>
<p>There's no questioning it.</p>
<p>You are sure.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yep.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So if we say, that movie was the best comedy I've seen all year.</p>
<p>Hands down.</p>
<p>Lindsay asked me, what do you think is hands down the best TV show of all time?</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, It's interesting where it comes from.</p>
<p>What does hands up mean?</p>
<p>Like, is that challenging the suggestion or the winning item?</p>
<p>What does that even mean?</p>
<p>We don't have the etymology today, but our listeners could look it up.</p>
<p>Guys, you can always go.</p>
<p>And we also don't say hands up.</p>
<p>Like that's hands up, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, No, we don't. We don't. But, but, but think about it, guys.</p>
<p>If you're watching us on YouTube, Lindsay, what about when people go, like, wait, hold on.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>I'm not seeing you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hands up.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hands up.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Could it could be that?</p>
<p>I mean, like a shrug, right?</p>
<p>It could it could be that I'm thinking maybe it could just be like a unanimous vote.</p>
<p>No one's. Oh, that doesn't make sense, though, because it would be hands up.</p>
<p>Everyone's voting for it.</p>
<p>That makes no sense.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, all we know is, you know, my hands are out of the picture.</p>
<p>I'm thinking like when you shrug and you're like, I don't know, right?</p>
<p>So maybe that's hands up.</p>
<p>So anyway, well, whatever.</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>But this is an important even though we don't know exactly where it comes from or why this phrase was created.</p>
<p>We don't need to know that to use it to connect.</p>
<p>Right, Michelle?</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, So today we're going to talk about additional ways you can express a confident opinion.</p>
<p>And these were not used in the other episode, like I said.</p>
<p>So, Lindsay, what's the first word we can use?</p>
<p>I like this easily.</p>
<p>So for example, this is easily the best chocolate cake I've ever had.</p>
<p>Yes, Hmm.</p>
<p>I love chocolate lava cake.</p>
<p>I love it when the lava's in the middle.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>it when the love is in the middle.</p>
<p>Gooey and warm.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>Next one's really high level.</p>
<p>Yes, this is a high level one guys.</p>
<p>So indisputably, I'll say it again, indisputably.</p>
<p>This one is going to be great for our high level C1 students who just joined our C1 course.</p>
<p>Everyone, if you're in that course, I want you to write this one down because this is advanced English.</p>
<p>This will get you a band seven or higher on IELTS.</p>
<p>It is fantastic.</p>
<p>Articulate.</p>
<p>Yeah, So what's an example?</p>
<p>How would we use indisputably?</p>
<p>We are indisputably much better at sales calls than the other team.</p>
<p>It's a mouthful.</p>
<p>I will say that word is a mouthful.</p>
<p>Indisputably.</p>
<p>Yeah, So if something is indisputable, it can't be disputed.</p>
<p>It can't be argued the other way.</p>
<p>There's no argument.</p>
<p>This is what it is.</p>
<p>So it is the same idea as hands down, but so much more high level.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't know.</p>
<p>There are times when we need.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>There are times when we need a more articulate phrase, a more formal-sounding articulate phrase and it depends on who you're in front of and who you're talking to.</p>
<p>Maybe you're in a job interview and you're using this to talk about your numbers in your last company that you achieved for your sales department, right?</p>
<p>We had indisputably the best sales team in the entire region, right?</p>
<p>But in front of your friends, maybe you're not going to worry about that deeper vocabulary.</p>
<p>You're just going to use something like easily.</p>
<p>We easily had the best sales team.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah, So the next one is by a mile.</p>
<p>So this one is slightly different, but similar idea.</p>
<p>So you could say, I like living here much more than my old place by a mile.</p>
<p>So you're just saying the intensity with which you like it is big.</p>
<p>Yeah, Right?</p>
<p>Right, Yeah, But here, maybe I'm stressing more the intensity.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>assessing more the intensity or comparison.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Okay, Michelle, we are back.</p>
<p>Another one we could say is what?</p>
<p>So have you ever heard this one?</p>
<p>This is when I was doing research and I saw this and this is adorable.</p>
<p>No, this is totally new for me.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I kept on coming up in my research that's as sure as eggs is eggs.</p>
<p>As sure as egg.</p>
<p>That's even not even correct grammar.</p>
<p>I know I'm looking it up again here.</p>
<p>Yeah, Wow.</p>
<p>This is sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, Hold on.</p>
<p>Let me look at as sure as eggs.</p>
<p>Yeah, as sure as eggs.</p>
<p>And apparently it's a song to as sure as egg.</p>
<p>Gosh, this might be more British.</p>
<p>So it says the definition says British English without any doubt.</p>
<p>Okay, love it.</p>
<p>So as who I would challenge our listeners.</p>
<p>Ask a British English speaker about this phrase, right?</p>
<p>Ask them about it.</p>
<p>And they can very cute.</p>
<p>Yeah, we just want to build your awareness that it exists.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>awareness that it exists.</p>
<p>But yeah, here we focus mostly on American English, but ask, this is a conversation starter.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>It's fun.</p>
<p>And then we'll do one more, which is irrefutably.</p>
<p>So the other one was indisputably.</p>
<p>Here we have irrefutably.</p>
<p>This could make a poem here.</p>
<p>These terms rhyme.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And they're both mouthfuls.</p>
<p>They're both C1 level, high level vocabulary.</p>
<p>She is irrefutably our strongest employee.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>If our listeners can get some of these high level vocabulary words in their back pocket, very useful.</p>
<p>Don't you think?</p>
<p>Yeah, Oh, for sure.</p>
<p>Lindsay, which one of these do you feel most connected to?</p>
<p>Which is your favorite?</p>
<p>I like easily.</p>
<p>I use easily a lot.</p>
<p>You know, this is easily the best chocolate cake I've ever had.</p>
<p>I easily live in the best neighborhood in Denver, right?</p>
<p>Obviously that's my opinion, but I like to express my opinion in a strong, definitive way.</p>
<p>Otherwise, what's the point of having an opinion?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>opinion.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Be confident in your opinions.</p>
<p>Lindsay, just before we start to head out and do a role play, let's do a couple of conversation questions.</p>
<p>So let's try and use a word in each one.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>Fun.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, Michelle, what is your favorite sport?</p>
<p>Oh, my favorite sport is basketball, hands down.</p>
<p>I actually just took my son to a Knicks game and that was really fun last week.</p>
<p>Oh, very nice.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>Well, for me, skiing is easily my go-to sport because it's the way I want to spend my time on the weekend with my family, you know, outdoors.</p>
<p>Yeah, So it's easily the best.</p>
<p>Easily the best for you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Lindsay, what is the most rewarding part about your career?</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Indisputably, it is exactly what we're doing right now, Michelle, recording the podcast.</p>
<p>Actually, that's true.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's true.</p>
<p>It's my favorite.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>Yeah, It's true.</p>
<p>It's my favorite thing about what we do at Allure.</p>
<p>We do so many things.</p>
<p>We build courses.</p>
<p>We do marketing.</p>
<p>We do so much here.</p>
<p>But it actually comes down to just being on the microphone.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love it too.</p>
<p>Yeah, Irrefutably, it's my favorite part as well.</p>
<p>And just also, you know, hearing from our listeners, just knowing that, you know, like we had that reviewer, Amir, who had said that we are his fuel.</p>
<p>I mean, that to me, that's indisputably when I hear that.</p>
<p>Yeah, It's huge.</p>
<p>Yeah, We're very heart-centered here at Allure's English.</p>
<p>Yes, Aren't we?</p>
<p>Yeah, we are for sure.</p>
<p>And that comes to the next question, is who is the best singer of all time?</p>
<p>I know who you're going to say.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know who you're going to say.</p>
<p>You know it.</p>
<p>You know it.</p>
<p>Yeah, Oh, sure.</p>
<p>You answer, though, first, please.</p>
<p>See, this... Okay.</p>
<p>So, the best singer of all time.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I'm going to... I'll agree with you.</p>
<p>I know what you're going to say.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>One, two, three.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>time.</p>
<p>One, two, three, hands down Whitney Houston.</p>
<p>I wasn't sure if you were going to say Adele, if you thought I was going to say Adele, but no.</p>
<p>Adele is somewhere in the top five, I think.</p>
<p>But hands down, Whitney Houston's a great, oh, Freddie, Freddie, what's her name?</p>
<p>Freddie Mercury.</p>
<p>Freddie Mercury could be in there somewhere too.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>Well, Mariah Carey, not so much anymore, but she was amazing.</p>
<p>And then I still think Whitney takes the top, takes the top spot.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I would say also Kelly Clarkson has moved up there.</p>
<p>Really interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that's, I think she's thought of as having one of the best.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So, I mean, what I love about today's episode and these phrases is that we can, this is another way to assert who you are, right?</p>
<p>Another really useful way to say, yes, hands down, I live in the best neighborhood in Denver.</p>
<p>That means I like to walk, I like an urban environment.</p>
<p>That says so much about me as a person, more than in my opinion, it shows so much more than just what you're</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>knows so much more than just what you're saying.</p>
<p>Yeah, Whitney Houston, right?</p>
<p>So there's so much that you can say by being strong when you deliver your opinion.</p>
<p>Yeah, It just makes it.</p>
<p>Yeah, It's a different sound when you add it.</p>
<p>It gives a different feeling, this feeling of confidence when you can add in one of these.</p>
<p>So should we do a role play?</p>
<p>Yeah, let's do it.</p>
<p>So here we are friends talking about what we'll do over the weekend.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>We're not going to use all of them today, but we'll use a bunch.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So where should we go for brunch?</p>
<p>Oh, we have to try jelly toast.</p>
<p>I've heard it has the best brunch in town.</p>
<p>Hands down.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hopefully we can get a reservation.</p>
<p>I'll give them a call.</p>
<p>What should we do after that?</p>
<p>We have to check out the new Tom Hanks movie.</p>
<p>He's easily the best actor of our time.</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>By a mile.</p>
<p>Wasn't he in a movie, The Green Mile?</p>
<p>Oh, that's true.</p>
<p>Yeah, The Green Mile.</p>
<p>Yeah, That's kind of a little pun there, Rochelle.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>a little pun there, Michelle.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>I cut on fun.</p>
<p>All right, cool.</p>
<p>So that's funny because there is a brunch or a breakfast restaurant in my neighborhood called Jelly.</p>
<p>So that's fine.</p>
<p>Get out of here.</p>
<p>Yeah, right down the street.</p>
<p>Yeah, Oh, well, I have the most fun for a role plays coming up with names of restaurants and stores.</p>
<p>So yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, that's so funny.</p>
<p>That is weird.</p>
<p>But I'm not a brunch person.</p>
<p>Yeah, It's a brunch spot, though.</p>
<p>Um, it's it's not a bougie brunch spot.</p>
<p>It's more of a breakfast spot.</p>
<p>Like you walk in, it's pretty cool.</p>
<p>They have the walls covered in old school cereal boxes from the 90s.</p>
<p>Oh, fun.</p>
<p>You know, but it's not a place like you're going to wait in line.</p>
<p>It's a place to be seen.</p>
<p>It's not like that.</p>
<p>Well, a lot of brunch places are like that.</p>
<p>Right, Right, Right, Right, It's more casual.</p>
<p>It's more give more of a diner feeling to it.</p>
<p>Oh, I love that.</p>
<p>Oh, I love that.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Cool.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So I said you said we have to try jelly toast.</p>
<p>I've heard it has the best brunch in town.</p>
<p>Hands down.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then you suggested seeing the new Tom Hanks movie and you said he is easily the best actor of our time.</p>
<p>Mm hmm.</p>
<p>And then I'm totally on board with that statement.</p>
<p>And I say agreed by a mile, right?</p>
<p>By a green mile now.</p>
<p>By a green mile.</p>
<p>Yeah, Cool, Michelle.</p>
<p>So where should our listeners go?</p>
<p>Remind them about that other episode?</p>
<p>What is that number?</p>
<p>Right, So that's 1138.</p>
<p>So that's one handy phrase to show confidence in your suggestion.</p>
<p>So to get more on this topic, definitely listen to that episode.</p>
<p>And what's our takeaway today?</p>
<p>This is a great way to connect with people because you're showing confidence.</p>
<p>You're showing that you have a strong opinion.</p>
<p>And it's just a good way to either share that opinion with someone or to agree with them.</p>
<p>Right, Yeah, And I would also say reserve this for when you feel very strongly about your opinion.</p>
<p>Don't say it for everything.</p>
<p>You know, if you don't know very much about a topic or for</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p>you don't know very much about a topic or right kind of on the fence, it just doesn't feel right using these definitive statements.</p>
<p>But when you do feel strongly and you want to say something a bit more about, you know that this could say something about you too, and your taste and your knowledge, right?</p>
<p>It can be a really powerful tool to show people who you are.</p>
<p>And not to bring something up at the very end of the episode, but I'm going to.</p>
<p>Do you think I feel I'm just noticing hands down to me, it sounds more when you're talking about things being good.</p>
<p>Like, do you say that's the worst?</p>
<p>The worst stake I've ever had?</p>
<p>Hands down?</p>
<p>I guess you could.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>I think it's usually Yeah, it's usually about like, again, like people being the being the best people have voted for it.</p>
<p>Yeah, like, to me, it's more positive sounding.</p>
<p>I would say a lot of these Yeah, but some of these can go the other way, right?</p>
<p>Right, Yeah, doubly or indisputably.</p>
<p>Right, We're exactly the worst.</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p>Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>The worst.</p>
<p>Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>So, it doesn't... We leave hands down for the positive things.</p>
<p>Yeah, That's what I think.</p>
<p>I think that's fair.</p>
<p>I think that's fair.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
