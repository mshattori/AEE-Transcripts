<p>Hey, Aubrey, how are you?</p>
<p>Hello, Michelle.</p>
<p>Fancy seeing you here.</p>
<p>I know, it's like the Flintstones meet the Jetsons, you know?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Remember that?</p>
<p>You run into somebody.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>You run into somebody and yeah, it's like running into your teacher at the grocery store.</p>
<p>Exactly, right?</p>
<p>You have heard me and Lindsay, Michelle and Lindsay, but not very often do you get to hear Michelle and I together.</p>
<p>So this is very fun.</p>
<p>Yes, I'm very excited.</p>
<p>So this is going to be fun today.</p>
<p>But Aubrey, this is going to be a good episode because we have a lot to talk about here.</p>
<p>Do your kids fight over who gets to sit in the front seat or any seat in the car?</p>
<p>Yes, especially when we're in, I drive a Tesla and the back seat's kind of small.</p>
<p>So they're all fighting for the front seat.</p>
<p>As soon as we head out the door, one of them yells shotgun because they want to sit in the front seat by me, especially now that the twins are just barely old enough, tall enough that they can sit in the front.</p>
<p>Now I have all four of them fighting over it.</p>
<p>Oh, no, that's a lot.</p>
<p>That's a lot.</p>
<p>Did you fight with like siblings when you were younger about the front seat?</p>
<p>Yeah, my</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>Yeah, my brother and I, we would fight over the front seat, of course.</p>
<p>Yeah, but what you said, shotgun, that's what you say, right?</p>
<p>When you try and sit in the front and you try and call the front spot?</p>
<p>Is that what you said too?</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, I wonder what that comes from.</p>
<p>Shotgun, it's not related to a gun at all.</p>
<p>Weird.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>It is kind of interesting.</p>
<p>Well, so today we are actually going to answer a listener question about how to reserve something quickly before someone else gets to it.</p>
<p>And this question came to us from YouTube.</p>
<p>So this is from Hadi Hassan Atari, 155.</p>
<p>So thank you so much for that question.</p>
<p>I'll read the question.</p>
<p>It says, hi, I'm an avid learner of English and your podcast helped me a lot.</p>
<p>I have come to know that daily English expressions are like two different words from what we have gone through our textbook.</p>
<p>So the textbook is different from real English, right, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Absolutely, yes.</p>
<p>Always.</p>
<p>Yes, And then this listener asks, would you please make a video on</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>Would you please make a video on dibs?</p>
<p>Okay, so this listener asked about a couple different expressions, but we're, yeah, we're gonna go with dibs today.</p>
<p>Oh, this is a good one to call dibs when you want something.</p>
<p>And there are definitely different ways to do this depending on your regional dialect, where you grew up.</p>
<p>There are a lot of different things you'll hear, like saying shotgun to call the front seat of the car.</p>
<p>And I can think of a couple others that I'll bring up as we go here, but this is going to be so fun.</p>
<p>You guys, be sure to hit follow right here on the podcast.</p>
<p>If you are not following, you are missing so many fun episodes.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Make it easy on yourself.</p>
<p>Let us come to you just right in your listening queue.</p>
<p>So thank you to our listener for this question.</p>
<p>And yeah, we're going to focus on dibs and other ways to express this.</p>
<p>So dibs.</p>
<p>First of all, Aubrey, how do we spell dibs?</p>
<p>Yeah, it's spelled D-I-B-S. And it's not like a verb on its own, dib.</p>
<p>So I'm not sure really where this came from.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>So I'm not sure really where this came from, definitely slang to call dibs or say dibs when you want something.</p>
<p>It means you're saying something either belongs to you or is reserved for you.</p>
<p>I think about when we would be watching television as kids and we had our own seats and if you went up to go get a snack or something, we'd say place back.</p>
<p>But I know a lot of people will say dibs, like call dibs on this chair to keep your place saved.</p>
<p>Right, And I was actually thinking about what I used to say if you leave the chair and you want to save the chair and I couldn't remember what it was.</p>
<p>But guys, in the future I did plan an episode about saving a seat or asking if a seat is saved.</p>
<p>So again, hit follow to find that one when it comes out.</p>
<p>So this is kind of this unofficial rule.</p>
<p>It's not anything legal.</p>
<p>Right, Not binding.</p>
<p>Right, Not a binding agreement.</p>
<p>So it's often used, I would say, by kids and teens.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>I would say by kids and teens, but sometimes adults too.</p>
<p>It's kind of fun loving.</p>
<p>What do you think, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Would you say dibs?</p>
<p>Yeah, I do sometimes.</p>
<p>I'll call dibs on something.</p>
<p>I feel like with sports, like sometimes we're all either choosing a place or choosing like a paddle for pickleball and you might call dibs on the best one.</p>
<p>Yeah, something like that, right?</p>
<p>And I would say it is really lighthearted and friendly, but it is kind of funny.</p>
<p>If someone calls dibs, it is this unwritten rule that it would be like rude and selfish to then take it anyway.</p>
<p>Right, It's true.</p>
<p>It's not a binding agreement, but for some reason there is this feeling of, oh, too late.</p>
<p>Yeah, no one else gets it now.</p>
<p>No one would dare.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And it makes me think of sibling rivalry too.</p>
<p>The siblings are kind of competing for it.</p>
<p>So a lot with kids.</p>
<p>But again, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, well, because kids tend to want things fastest and first.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>fastest and first.</p>
<p>So you'll hear it a lot with kids, I think.</p>
<p>And it is, there is a little bit of a feeling of immaturity to it.</p>
<p>Like if a coworker called dibs on a chair or like a drink in the fridge or something would feel strange.</p>
<p>It is much more likely to be siblings, kids, because it is kind of an immature thing to do.</p>
<p>So, but your example of kind of doing it for the pickleball court, something like that, more social, more lighthearted.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Kind of more to be playful, to be silly.</p>
<p>Playful, exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>So let's do an example.</p>
<p>Aubrey, you can start this.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Oh, there's one more cookie.</p>
<p>Dibs! No! This is a great example.</p>
<p>I'd be like, how dare you?</p>
<p>You need to split that in half.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>And Aubrey, you also brought light to this already, to call dibs on something.</p>
<p>So sometimes we just go dibs, but sometimes we say call dibs on something.</p>
<p>So let's do a role play to show how that would look like.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>that would look like.</p>
<p>Okay, let's start the movie.</p>
<p>Okay, but I call dibs on the comfy chair.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Yes, and I would totally do this even now with my kids.</p>
<p>There's a corner seat.</p>
<p>We have one of those couches, like a sectional that wraps around.</p>
<p>So the corner is really deep and comfy and everyone dives for it or calls dibs.</p>
<p>They want that spot.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>There's always a special spot on the couch that everybody wants.</p>
<p>So yeah, so you call dibs on the couch, pickleball paddles, anything else you can remember from now or from when you were a kid?</p>
<p>Hmm, I wonder, I'm trying to think.</p>
<p>I feel like there are a lot of things that I will call dibs playfully.</p>
<p>Food, I think, is a good example.</p>
<p>I love this cookie example.</p>
<p>I could see that if there's a cheese board and there's one last, I don't know, piece of charcuterie, I might call dibs on that.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>But yeah.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>But yeah, another way to say this is to just call something.</p>
<p>So we're going to talk about other ways to say this.</p>
<p>To call something or some people might just say, I call it, right?</p>
<p>Yes, especially if it has been named, like the cookie example.</p>
<p>If someone says, oh, there's only one more cookie.</p>
<p>I call it.</p>
<p>That just means like the same as dibs, it's mine.</p>
<p>Same, right, exactly.</p>
<p>Or you could also say, I call the blue pencil, right?</p>
<p>If a kid is coloring and they want to have the blue pencil.</p>
<p>That's happened a lot when we're playing games.</p>
<p>If there are like dry erase markers or some kind of, you know, with the game, then something about my children, maybe everyone's children are like this.</p>
<p>I was probably this way too.</p>
<p>You want to like have your favorite and choose it.</p>
<p>And then when we become adults, we don't care as much.</p>
<p>I'm like, I'll take any marker, it's fine.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>Yes, but for kids, all of this is very, very extremely important feeling.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>feelings.</p>
<p>But maybe you identify with this one, Aubrey.</p>
<p>So can you read the next one about ice cream?</p>
<p>Yes, I'm taking the last scoop.</p>
<p>You didn't call it, so I'm going for it.</p>
<p>This is really good, and I would do, right?</p>
<p>Nobody's called it, so this reminds me, my husband's family did this thing, they have this thing when they were young that they would leave one last, like a little bit left in ice cream or one last cookie intentionally, and then whoever took it, they would like make fun of them.</p>
<p>They would mock them, harass them.</p>
<p>They would be like, you hogged it or however they said it.</p>
<p>And they did that to me one of the first times I met them.</p>
<p>Like I took the last one and then everybody, oh, I can't believe you took the last one.</p>
<p>So funny.</p>
<p>Really funny.</p>
<p>That's so funny.</p>
<p>Well, my dad does this, right, because they, but they were kind of setting you up for it.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>My dad always, whenever, he's trying to be nice, but I can always tell when he wants the last one because he'll, you know, everybody's</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>Everyone's still eating their piece of whatever it is for dinner, and then he'll look around and kind of name everybody, like, Michelle, Dan, do you want some, Dan?</p>
<p>But you know that it's actually that he wants it, but he just wants to check in, which is a very nice thing to do, but I always know it's because he wants it.</p>
<p>I totally do that too, and I know people who do that where they're like asking everyone, would you like this?</p>
<p>But you know that you're going to say no because you know they want it.</p>
<p>Right, right, exactly.</p>
<p>They're just making a show of being polite, but really they're saying, do you mind if I take this?</p>
<p>It's so true.</p>
<p>It's so true.</p>
<p>So let's talk about a couple other ways that you might say this.</p>
<p>Actually, well, we already, oh, well, we have one extra, but we already talked about shotgun.</p>
<p>So again, shotgun is really, to me, that one is specifically for the front seat of a car, right?</p>
<p>Do you think that's used in other ways?</p>
<p>No, I don't hear it any other way, and I'm actually really curious about how this is said in other languages.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>How this is said in other language and other cultures and other languages.</p>
<p>I would love for you guys to come to the YouTube video of this podcast and leave in the comments what do you say in your language and then translate it into English to call the front seat of a car.</p>
<p>Because I'm sure this can't just be American culture.</p>
<p>This has to exist elsewhere.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>And then another thing sometimes, this is even more childish.</p>
<p>This is probably the most childish of all of them is just saying mine.</p>
<p>Yes, little kids do this a lot, right?</p>
<p>If you say, oh, who would like this candy?</p>
<p>And instead of saying I would please, they just yell mine.</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It's funny because we say this a lot in sports.</p>
<p>Like in volleyball, if a ball is coming between two people, you yell mine.</p>
<p>Sometimes people will say like I go or something, but I say mine.</p>
<p>Mine.</p>
<p>And I run for it.</p>
<p>So I end up saying that kind of often.</p>
<p>But that's almost, it's...</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>It's the same idea, but it's more so because you are saying I take responsibility.</p>
<p>To avoid collision.</p>
<p>Right, to avoid collision.</p>
<p>And it's like, oh, this is my responsibility, I got it, right?</p>
<p>So not so much that you're saying, get out of the way.</p>
<p>Right, that's very different, right?</p>
<p>This is like you're trying to communicate to make sure no one runs into each other, make sure someone gets the ball and we know who's gonna get it.</p>
<p>The way we're talking about here is much more childish and selfish to yell mine, to claim something that really you don't have any right to.</p>
<p>Exactly, so if we're in the store and we're shopping and there's only one bag left that we both like, and I might just say, I want that bag and you could go, mine.</p>
<p>I can't imagine doing this as an adult.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>That would be really silly and playful.</p>
<p>Even then, I don't know if I would say that.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>So guys, that's the most childish one.</p>
<p>But Aubrey, which one of these is your favorite that you feel is the most useful for our listeners too?</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>useful for our listeners too.</p>
<p>Probably shotgun.</p>
<p>I say the most.</p>
<p>I hear the most still, but it is specific to the front seat of a car.</p>
<p>So dibs is useful for calling anything playfully.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>What do you think, Jess?</p>
<p>Or, yeah.</p>
<p>I think I'll do best, Michelle.</p>
<p>It's okay.</p>
<p>I've been so proud of myself for not calling you Lindsay.</p>
<p>Right, So, yeah.</p>
<p>I think I might use, I call it the most frequently to call something.</p>
<p>To me, that's the most adult.</p>
<p>I can see that.</p>
<p>I call this cookie.</p>
<p>I call that pen.</p>
<p>Yeah, Right, But again, guys, even play around with this.</p>
<p>It's good to know what these mean so that you know when somebody is calling dibs on something, what that means.</p>
<p>But it's a good way to show your personality as well.</p>
<p>Don't force yourself to use this.</p>
<p>This is not one of those, oh, if you use this, everything is going to be amazing.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>You know, everything is going to be amazing, right?</p>
<p>This is kind of one of those episodes about showcasing your personality and giving things a try and playing with them.</p>
<p>What do you think, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yes, and it would be weird to do this all the time.</p>
<p>It would probably be pretty annoying if you had a friend that did all of these.</p>
<p>Then you're going to get a reputation.</p>
<p>Use these sparingly.</p>
<p>Sparingly, exactly.</p>
<p>So, Aubrey, would you like to do a role play with me?</p>
<p>Yeah, let's do it.</p>
<p>In this role play, you and I are roommates coming home from dinner out.</p>
<p>Fun.</p>
<p>Okay, all right, here we go.</p>
<p>That was so good.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I'm hungry for dessert, though.</p>
<p>Oh, no, you don't. Dibs on that last cookie in the fridge.</p>
<p>No, I called it yesterday.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Fine, fine.</p>
<p>Okay, remember, I need to stop by Jen's house and pick her up.</p>
<p>Okay, I call shotgun, though.</p>
<p>That's fine.</p>
<p>This is reminding me of this role play that we do this often for things in the fridge.</p>
<p>My kids or me will be like, I call dibs on those leftovers.</p>
<p>No one else touch them.</p>
<p>Or I'll come home from a restaurant with leftovers and tell all my kids.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>from a restaurant with leftovers and tell all my kids, like, those are mine.</p>
<p>I call dibs.</p>
<p>You're not allowed to eat them or it will disappear.</p>
<p>Especially, I think this is also very common for moms in general, because the kids are always going to eat your stuff.</p>
<p>And so if something really is important to you, then you do have to kind of mark your territory and say, well, hold on, this is serious, right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, my mom had given me a gift when she came into town of a little bag of like Pepperidge Farm cookies, those Milano cookies that are not that cheap.</p>
<p>So I don't buy them for myself, really.</p>
<p>And I went to eat one of my children had eaten them.</p>
<p>They were gone.</p>
<p>I should have called them.</p>
<p>I should have called dibs.</p>
<p>You should have called dibs.</p>
<p>That was the problem.</p>
<p>So let's go through this, Aubrey.</p>
<p>So let's see.</p>
<p>You said you're hungry for dessert.</p>
<p>And I said, oh, no, you don't. Right, So that basically meant.</p>
<p>You knew there was one last cookie.</p>
<p>You're like, don't you dare.</p>
<p>Dibs on that last.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p>Dibs on that last cookie.</p>
<p>Dibs on that last cookie, right.</p>
<p>But then you kind of argued, and what did you say?</p>
<p>I said, no, I called it yesterday.</p>
<p>So this means I have reserved it for myself.</p>
<p>I called it.</p>
<p>I must have said something to you, like, I call that last cookie in the fridge.</p>
<p>Right, And I feel kind of bad about this because I'm really not being nice.</p>
<p>I mean, if you called it yesterday, but then I say, sorry.</p>
<p>So I wasn't very nice.</p>
<p>But then you're nice.</p>
<p>You kind of back down.</p>
<p>And it turns out we're changing the subject and we need to go pick up a friend.</p>
<p>So I said, OK, I call shotgun, though.</p>
<p>So meaning that maybe you're driving, but I'm almost calling shotgun on our other friend.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You're saying because sometimes there is this sort of hierarchy with friends that maybe the person we're picking up usually sits in the front.</p>
<p>And you're saying that's not happening this time.</p>
<p>I call shotgun.</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p>That's not happening this time.</p>
<p>I call shotgun.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, this is so fun.</p>
<p>So Aubrey, I want to direct our listeners over if you want to check out a business English episode.</p>
<p>Episode 376 was in limbo at work, how to get through it.</p>
<p>Yeah, such a fun one.</p>
<p>Be sure to follow the business English podcast too.</p>
<p>A lot of great vocabulary over there that you can use in daily conversations and at work.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So what's the takeaway for today, Aubrey?</p>
<p>I love what we mentioned that you don't want to overuse these, right?</p>
<p>Choose one, say it maybe once a week.</p>
<p>This is not something you want to even say like multiple times a day.</p>
<p>It could get annoying because you're sort of playfully being selfish.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>This is not, yeah, this is a little argumentative, just having a good time.</p>
<p>But if you say it all the time, it's going to sound ridiculous.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So they're fun.</p>
<p>They're playful.</p>
<p>Definitely throw in an every now and then sparingly, as we said.</p>
<p>Sparingly.</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p>Sparingly, as we said.</p>
<p>This was really fun, Michelle.</p>
<p>I love this book.</p>
<p>It brought back a lot of fun memories from childhood.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And that's one of the reasons I decided that this would be a good listener question because it really, it says it can help you to connect with people over things about your childhood and bringing up these kinds of stories.</p>
<p>So you give these a try sparingly.</p>
<p>Yes, Awesome.</p>
<p>Love it, Michelle.</p>
<p>And I will see you very soon.</p>
<p>All right, Aubrey.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for talking with me today.</p>
<p>This was fun.</p>
<p>Yes, thanks.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
