<p id="p-17">Good, Lindsay.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-18">Good.</p>
<p id="p-19">Lindsay, how are you?</p>
<p id="p-20">Good.</p>
<p id="p-21">Michelle, did you get scolded a lot when you were a kid?</p>
<p id="p-22">Did your parents or teachers maybe scold you?</p>
<p id="p-23">I don't think really.</p>
<p id="p-24">I was a little bit of a rule follower, so I think I didn't get scolded that much.</p>
<p id="p-25">But of course, every kid does, right?</p>
<p id="p-26">There has to be something.</p>
<p id="p-27">What about you?</p>
<p id="p-28">Yeah, same here.</p>
<p id="p-29">I was a pretty good kid.</p>
<p id="p-30">Occasionally I would get in trouble, but when I did, I felt so bad.</p>
<p id="p-31">I felt so bad.</p>
<p id="p-32">I think I got detention once, and I just was so mortified.</p>
<p id="p-33">Mortified.</p>
<p id="p-34">It was not a place for me to be in detention.</p>
<p id="p-35">So yeah, not good.</p>
<p id="p-36">So anyways, Michelle, what are we talking about today?</p>
<p id="p-37">Okay, so we are going to talk about a common, well, actually not that common, but it's common in this context, when you're scolding someone or questioning someone.</p>
<p id="p-38">So we're going to talk about why you would use this on this episode.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-39">this on this episode.</p>
<p id="p-40">But the construction is have you know X? Oh, I love this.</p>
<p id="p-41">Yes, Tell us more, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-42">Well, this came up in my real life because my son was probably I can't remember exactly what he's doing, but I think it probably involved eating a lot of dessert.</p>
<p id="p-43">And I think I said to him, have you no self control?</p>
<p id="p-44">Like as a joke.</p>
<p id="p-45">And of course, he didn't understand.</p>
<p id="p-46">Yeah, he doesn't know what self control is.</p>
<p id="p-47">Yes, But I thought there's an episode.</p>
<p id="p-48">Lindsay, I mean, have you heard this kind of construction before?</p>
<p id="p-49">Yes, it definitely sounds like something I've heard, especially coupled with have you no shame?</p>
<p id="p-50">Right?</p>
<p id="p-51">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-52">It's kind of a creative way of saying something.</p>
<p id="p-53">I envision this being used by like, grandmothers to their grandkids.</p>
<p id="p-54">I don't know why.</p>
<p id="p-55">It just feels like a little bit of an older phrase or a more creative way to say this.</p>
<p id="p-56">Yeah, Yes, So we're going to talk</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-57">Yeah, so we're going to talk about this today.</p>
<p id="p-58">It's not super, super common, but I think it's definitely worth an episode, definitely worth learning what it is because if you hear it, it could be a little confusing, right?</p>
<p id="p-59">And it's good for our listeners to have these creative tools in their toolboxes, right?</p>
<p id="p-60">I mean, sometimes we might pull this out maybe on the IELTS exam.</p>
<p id="p-61">Who knows?</p>
<p id="p-62">Maybe there's, I mean, this is generally a back and forth connection phrase and the IELTS exam is more you speaking at the examiner, really.</p>
<p id="p-63">But there could be a lot of places where we want to drop something really unique and creative.</p>
<p id="p-64">And this would be something you could do.</p>
<p id="p-65">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-66">Guys, make sure to hit the follow button wherever you're listening to the All Ears English podcast so you never miss anything from us.</p>
<p id="p-67">Yeah, so we might hear this in movies or maybe as a joke, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-68">Anywhere else we might hear it?</p>
<p id="p-69">Do you agree with what I said, a grandmother scolding their grandkids?</p>
<p id="p-70">Yeah, I do.</p>
<p id="p-71">I don't even know why.</p>
<p id="p-72">I do.</p>
<p id="p-73">Right, maybe movies as a joke, whatever it is.</p>
<p id="p-74">So with</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-75">is as a joke, whatever it is.</p>
<p id="p-76">So with my son, I was not really being serious.</p>
<p id="p-77">I was kind of jabbing at him, maybe just trying to make a joke that why would he get it?</p>
<p id="p-78">Because he's six.</p>
<p id="p-79">But it just kind of made me laugh because I was thinking, have you no self-control?</p>
<p id="p-80">Just, you know, a little funny thing, maybe a little joke to myself.</p>
<p id="p-81">But yeah, it's a very interesting construction.</p>
<p id="p-82">I mean, Lindsay, we're really talking about this.</p>
<p id="p-83">Now we're going to go for have you no shame because you mentioned that.</p>
<p id="p-84">When you think of have you no, I think most people would think to put shame.</p>
<p id="p-85">Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-86">It's the most common use of this construction.</p>
<p id="p-87">And I like what you said, making a joke to yourself.</p>
<p id="p-88">I think when you choose to use this construction, it's saying more about you as a speaker than it is about the other person.</p>
<p id="p-89">It's saying that you want to say something unique and you want to kind of create a platform a little bit.</p>
<p id="p-90">It's quite a unique delivery.</p>
<p id="p-91">And so, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-92">Sometimes we do things just for ourselves.</p>
<p id="p-93">Oh, yeah, of course.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-94">Oh yeah, of course.</p>
<p id="p-95">Yeah, you want to entertain yourself.</p>
<p id="p-96">But what does this mean, have you no shame?</p>
<p id="p-97">What is this construction really saying?</p>
<p id="p-98">If we were to put it, what would make sense?</p>
<p id="p-99">It's basically saying you're doing something bad and don't you care that you're doing something bad, right?</p>
<p id="p-100">Like don't you have any shame about what you're doing right now?</p>
<p id="p-101">You're doing something, usually it's lighter things, right?</p>
<p id="p-102">It's not very heavy, serious things.</p>
<p id="p-103">So if you were supposed, a typical construction might be don't you have any?</p>
<p id="p-104">But we're making it have you no.</p>
<p id="p-105">And it's kind of, I think when this is used, it's kind of a rhetorical question.</p>
<p id="p-106">Don't you think, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-107">I mean, Lindsay, what is a rhetorical question?</p>
<p id="p-108">Oh, we could do a whole episode on rhetorical questions.</p>
<p id="p-109">And we should, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-110">It's just basically a question that's not</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-111">It's just basically a question that's not looking for an answer.</p>
<p id="p-112">It's more a question as a statement.</p>
<p id="p-113">Okay?</p>
<p id="p-114">So when someone asks you a rhetorical question, they're not expecting you to respond.</p>
<p id="p-115">Okay?</p>
<p id="p-116">Right, right.</p>
<p id="p-117">I'm not saying, have you no shame?</p>
<p id="p-118">Oh, um, I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-119">Maybe I have a little shame.</p>
<p id="p-120">It's not asking for a response.</p>
<p id="p-121">I'm basically saying, it seems I'm observing that you don't seem to have any shame.</p>
<p id="p-122">Yes, yes.</p>
<p id="p-123">And what you're doing is shameful, whatever it is.</p>
<p id="p-124">Right, Yeah, Really rare, but creative and fun when you do hear it, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-125">Right, It's just saying, like, how are you not embarrassed by this?</p>
<p id="p-126">That type of thing.</p>
<p id="p-127">So this is just really kind of fun to use.</p>
<p id="p-128">Let's do a couple other examples.</p>
<p id="p-129">So let's say I offer Lindsay coffee at my house, and she asks for a sugar.</p>
<p id="p-130">And then we open up my cabinet, and I have 300 sugar packets taken from a restaurant.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-131">Right, It's this kind of thing.</p>
<p id="p-132">It's like stealing from a hotel towels or things like that, right, that you really shouldn't do.</p>
<p id="p-133">And then someone might call you out for it.</p>
<p id="p-134">Right, Yes, Calling someone out.</p>
<p id="p-135">That's a really good way to explain this.</p>
<p id="p-136">So if I open up and you see I have this whole drawer full of all these sugar packets I've stolen.</p>
<p id="p-137">And they all have the branding of the restaurants on them.</p>
<p id="p-138">Right, right, right, right.</p>
<p id="p-139">So you could say.</p>
<p id="p-140">I would say, my goodness, Michelle, have you no shame?</p>
<p id="p-141">Right, So it's also in the delivery.</p>
<p id="p-142">There has to be some real energy in your voice there.</p>
<p id="p-143">Right?</p>
<p id="p-144">Yes, Right, Yeah, You can't say, have you no shame.</p>
<p id="p-145">Right, You have to have that energy.</p>
<p id="p-146">Or let's say you tell me that you have four overdue library books that you have to return.</p>
<p id="p-147">Yeah, And I could joke to you and say, have you no shame, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-148">Return them on time.</p>
<p id="p-149">That's another good example.</p>
<p id="p-150">So it's kind of these little transgressions, right, that you really shouldn't do.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-151">You really shouldn't do, but it's not like we're talking about huge offenses, right?</p>
<p id="p-152">Right, And your friend's going to call you out on it, and it's going to be kind of a fun back and forth, because they're surprised or they're a little offended by it, but not in a deep way, right?</p>
<p id="p-153">Well, I have a more serious one, though.</p>
<p id="p-154">One coming up.</p>
<p id="p-155">So those are kind of cute, but I mean, it could be more serious.</p>
<p id="p-156">So let's say a couple is fighting because one of them saw the other flirting at a party.</p>
<p id="p-157">So seriously, they could say, have you no shame?</p>
<p id="p-158">Don't you see I'm right there?</p>
<p id="p-159">Oh, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-160">And that could be.</p>
<p id="p-161">Oh, wow.</p>
<p id="p-162">Sounded emotional, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-163">Yes, That's good.</p>
<p id="p-164">Yeah, So it could veer into the more, initiating more of a fight, more of a serious emotional thing going on.</p>
<p id="p-165">So there are kind of two potential scenarios there.</p>
<p id="p-166">And we hope more so that in your life, you'll be using the first one.</p>
<p id="p-167">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-168">100%. Okay.</p>
<p id="p-169">All right, Michelle, we are back.</p>
<p id="p-170">So Michelle, do you use this phrase?</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-171">back.</p>
<p id="p-172">So Michelle, do you use this construction?</p>
<p id="p-173">Well, I brought it here because I did use it.</p>
<p id="p-174">But again, I wouldn't say that it's something, you know, this isn't something that you're going to use all the time.</p>
<p id="p-175">This isn't something that you're just going to, several times a day, this is just for once in a while.</p>
<p id="p-176">And this is not something you should pressure yourself to use.</p>
<p id="p-177">No, it's just if you're interested in adding a little something fun to your repertoire, it does show a little personality, which can be good.</p>
<p id="p-178">So not something totally immediate for you to add in.</p>
<p id="p-179">But if you're someone who likes to experiment with these kinds of constructions and these little changes, go for it.</p>
<p id="p-180">For sure.</p>
<p id="p-181">I mean, so again, the places where we use this are more rhetorical questions saying when you've observed someone that's doing something that's not really right, and you want to call them out, right?</p>
<p id="p-182">Yeah, So yeah, like accusing them of someone of something, or it could</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-183">You can't just stick any word in there, right?</p>
<p id="p-184">It can't just be, have you no almonds?</p>
<p id="p-185">You know, it can't, like... Right, no, no, no, that doesn't mean the same thing, right?</p>
<p id="p-186">Yeah, we can't put just a noun in there.</p>
<p id="p-187">It's really just shame and then maybe self-control.</p>
<p id="p-188">It's really about this person has done something wrong and you're going to, again, you're going to let them know they have and you're going to let them know that you're a little offended, but in a bit of an animated way.</p>
<p id="p-189">So you can't say, have you no almonds?</p>
<p id="p-190">Have you no pillows?</p>
<p id="p-191">It doesn't work.</p>
<p id="p-192">Have you no pillows?</p>
<p id="p-193">Yeah, It doesn't really work in that way.</p>
<p id="p-194">So some things you might hear would be something like self-control, like what I said to my son, or what about morals?</p>
<p id="p-195">Have you no morals?</p>
<p id="p-196">Yeah, I think that totally works.</p>
<p id="p-197">Same idea.</p>
<p id="p-198">It comes back to this kind of value judgment zone, right?</p>
<p id="p-199">Where someone is</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-200">where someone has kind of broken an unwritten rule or maybe a written rule and you don't think it's okay but you also don't want to get so serious and saying you shouldn't have done that, right?</p>
<p id="p-201">Because that can get a little too heavy for some scenarios.</p>
<p id="p-202">What are you going to do?</p>
<p id="p-203">Sit down and lecture me about sugar?</p>
<p id="p-204">It's too much.</p>
<p id="p-205">Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-206">Should we do a role play?</p>
<p id="p-207">Yeah, so here we're friends and I am telling you about a shopping spree that I just went on.</p>
<p id="p-208">Ooh, wow.</p>
<p id="p-209">Okay, there we go.</p>
<p id="p-210">So I went on a shopping spree and I went a little overboard.</p>
<p id="p-211">Oh yeah?</p>
<p id="p-212">Yeah, I bought not one, not two, not three, not four, but five new purses.</p>
<p id="p-213">Lindsay! I know.</p>
<p id="p-214">Have you no shame?</p>
<p id="p-215">Well, it was Black Friday.</p>
<p id="p-216">I couldn't help myself.</p>
<p id="p-217">I get it, but five purses?</p>
<p id="p-218">Have you no self-control?</p>
<p id="p-219">I was weak.</p>
<p id="p-220">Oh geez, what am I</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-221">Oh, geez, what a mess.</p>
<p id="p-222">Oh my gosh, five purses.</p>
<p id="p-223">That's a lot.</p>
<p id="p-224">That is a lot.</p>
<p id="p-225">How many purses would you say you own?</p>
<p id="p-226">I have a feeling you're like me.</p>
<p id="p-227">I don't really own any purses right now.</p>
<p id="p-228">You think I have like three.</p>
<p id="p-229">Basically I get cheap ones and then when I make them gross enough by just throwing stuff in and then eventually I just clean them out and then I might have to get rid of them.</p>
<p id="p-230">Oh no, I actually have a fanny pack.</p>
<p id="p-231">I guess the fanny pack is the modern purse for my style.</p>
<p id="p-232">So fanny packs are back.</p>
<p id="p-233">They were hot in the 1980s.</p>
<p id="p-234">I remember my aunt Sheila used to wear them and I used to think they were so nerdy, but they're back and they're cool now.</p>
<p id="p-235">They are.</p>
<p id="p-236">They are.</p>
<p id="p-237">All right.</p>
<p id="p-238">So let's go through this role play, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-239">Basically I bought five purses on Black Friday and you're saying, have you no shame?</p>
<p id="p-240">Yes, Right, Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-241">It's like you're saying it was Black Friday.</p>
<p id="p-242">I couldn't help myself and I said, I get it, but five purses, have you no self-control?</p>
<p id="p-243">So I may not use it,</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-244">So I may not use it again, right?</p>
<p id="p-245">Like that way, I just did it for the role play.</p>
<p id="p-246">But again, we don't want to use it all the time.</p>
<p id="p-247">So I could have, I could have, but I could have also said, don't you have any self-control?</p>
<p id="p-248">Right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-249">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-250">And this is another example.</p>
<p id="p-251">So this is not like I've committed some kind of transgression, but it's more like, it's a self-control thing, right?</p>
<p id="p-252">That's kind of crazy to buy five purses, sort of, by some people's definition, right?</p>
<p id="p-253">So there you go.</p>
<p id="p-254">Michelle, is there another episode we could check out?</p>
<p id="p-255">Yes, let's check out.</p>
<p id="p-256">Guys, take a look at episode 2343.</p>
<p id="p-257">That was how to say that two people don't mix well in English.</p>
<p id="p-258">Love that.</p>
<p id="p-259">And where should we leave our listeners?</p>
<p id="p-260">This has been a very creative phrase to bring in today to add a lot of personality.</p>
<p id="p-261">And again, at the beginning, Michelle, by the way, we said that you might hear this from a grandmother scolding their grandchild, but it's not just for grandparents to use, right?</p>
<p id="p-262">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-263">No, no, no, no.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-264">Right, Okay.</p>
<p id="p-265">No, no, no, you can do it, but you kind of just have to do it with a little bit of a jokey tone.</p>
<p id="p-266">But again, of course, if it's the serious one, don't use the jokey tone.</p>
<p id="p-267">Right, right.</p>
<p id="p-268">That's verging into, that's like the opening of a bigger fight, like with a couple.</p>
<p id="p-269">Someone was flirting, more of a serious emotional thing.</p>
<p id="p-270">But most of the time, I would say if you try to veer towards this area of kind of teasing someone, there's a little teasing going on too under the... Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-271">I'm just making... Maybe with the sugar example, maybe you're known for this.</p>
<p id="p-272">Maybe you come back with all the soap from the hotel.</p>
<p id="p-273">And so, you know, I'm just calling you out.</p>
<p id="p-274">I think it comes back to calling people out on maybe their quirks.</p>
<p id="p-275">Yes, So it can actually say that you... It can actually show that you know someone really well when you use this.</p>
<p id="p-276">Well, and that's a good point.</p>
<p id="p-277">I wouldn't really use this if you don't know the person well.</p>
<p id="p-278">Right, Right?</p>
<p id="p-279">You know, if you, for example... Yeah, you got to have a...</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-280">you know, if you, for example, like, you gotta have a good relationship with them to use this.</p>
<p id="p-281">Yeah, like if your boss invites you and your partner to dinner with them and then, you know, you don't know them very well, it's a very formal relationship, but you find out that the boss's partner is stealing sugars, I would not use that in that case.</p>
<p id="p-282">Right, right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-283">It shows how well you know someone.</p>
<p id="p-284">Yes, yes.</p>
<p id="p-285">Give it a try if you feel comfortable, but now you know why you might hear that funny kind of construction.</p>
<p id="p-286">Good to know.</p>
