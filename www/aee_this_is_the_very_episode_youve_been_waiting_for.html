<p id="p-19">Hello, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-20">How are you?</p>
<p id="p-21">Hi, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-22">I'm good.</p>
<p id="p-23">I'm good.</p>
<p id="p-24">Aubrey, is there something coming up that you're very excited about?</p>
<p id="p-25">Yeah, I'm actually volunteering tomorrow with my mom.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-26">I'm volunteering tomorrow with my mom and my twins.</p>
<p id="p-27">It's a nonprofit called Feed My Starving Children.</p>
<p id="p-28">Do you have that where you live, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-29">I've never heard of it.</p>
<p id="p-30">I have to look it up.</p>
<p id="p-31">I know they have locations elsewhere, but I'm not sure where.</p>
<p id="p-32">But they package meals that are sent elsewhere in the world to communities in need.</p>
<p id="p-33">And I really love going.</p>
<p id="p-34">It's kind of just like a factory where you're like packaging, you know, rice.</p>
<p id="p-35">But they make it really fun for the volunteers.</p>
<p id="p-36">It's really well run.</p>
<p id="p-37">I really love going.</p>
<p id="p-38">So I'm excited about that.</p>
<p id="p-39">Oh, that's good.</p>
<p id="p-40">That's good.</p>
<p id="p-41">Oh, I'm so glad to hear that.</p>
<p id="p-42">What about you?</p>
<p id="p-43">Is there something you are very excited about, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-44">I am very excited.</p>
<p id="p-45">Well, this is gosh, yours makes you sound like a saint and mine is like.</p>
<p id="p-46">Mine is just about sports.</p>
<p id="p-47">I'm very excited about I would say I'm very excited about the Super Bowl just because I'm living near now.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-48">I'm living now near the area where it's in, so I'm not a huge football fan, but I'm very excited for the area and I'm excited about the hype.</p>
<p id="p-49">But for me, my sports-wise, I'm very excited about the Knicks because they're doing well.</p>
<p id="p-50">So I'll say that.</p>
<p id="p-51">So there's probably a lot of, like, fervor where you live for the Super Bowl, right?</p>
<p id="p-52">That's fun.</p>
<p id="p-53">Yes, Yes, there's stuff everywhere.</p>
<p id="p-54">So it's kind of fun.</p>
<p id="p-55">It's fun to get into the hype.</p>
<p id="p-56">But we were using the word very, and we have a question from Sophia.</p>
<p id="p-57">This question came to us on YouTube.</p>
<p id="p-58">So, Aubrey, would you like to read us the question?</p>
<p id="p-59">Yes, Hi, I'm Sophia, and I really love your podcast, Connection, Not Perfection.</p>
<p id="p-60">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-61">I love when listeners let us know that they agree, right, with this.</p>
<p id="p-62">It's so powerful to have a whole community that, like, gets behind this connection.</p>
<p id="p-63">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-64">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-65">And then she said, I'm wondering about the use of very for emphasis.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-66">very for emphasis.</p>
<p id="p-67">I heard it can be used to mean something like extreme or absolute, especially when emphasizing something.</p>
<p id="p-68">For example, this is the very book I was looking for or at the very end of the road you'll find the old house.</p>
<p id="p-69">Could you explain more about this usage and share additional examples?</p>
<p id="p-70">Thank you so much.</p>
<p id="p-71">What a great question.</p>
<p id="p-72">Yeah, this is a good one, Sophia.</p>
<p id="p-73">Very, very good.</p>
<p id="p-74">Very advanced question.</p>
<p id="p-75">And notice how much I'm saying very, but this is not the way that Sophia is asking about it.</p>
<p id="p-76">Sophia is asking about another way to use the word very.</p>
<p id="p-77">So very advanced.</p>
<p id="p-78">Before we get into it, guys, we want to remind you to hit follow wherever you are listening to the All Ears English podcast so that you never miss anything from us.</p>
<p id="p-79">So let's get into it.</p>
<p id="p-80">Aubrey, do you use very like this a lot?</p>
<p id="p-81">I don't. I would usually say exact if I'm going to say this...</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-82">exact, if I'm going to say this is the exact book I was looking for, this is the exact thing I asked for instead of very, in that situation.</p>
<p id="p-83">What about you?</p>
<p id="p-84">Yeah, I would agree.</p>
<p id="p-85">I think that this can be useful, but it's probably not quite that common.</p>
<p id="p-86">So when you're thinking about the word very, definitely think more about the typical way that you would use it.</p>
<p id="p-87">The first example Sophia was giving about extreme and things like that.</p>
<p id="p-88">However, this is definitely worth learning and worth a try because you will hear it from time to time and it could be a fun thing to sprinkle into your lexicon every once in a while.</p>
<p id="p-89">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-90">I definitely hear it.</p>
<p id="p-91">I use it every now and then.</p>
<p id="p-92">Maybe if I'm trying to sound a little more sophisticated because I do feel like it does sound a little more polished.</p>
<p id="p-93">Say this is the very book I was looking for.</p>
<p id="p-94">It also might be more common in other English speaking countries, maybe in the UK, for example.</p>
<p id="p-95">And her second example, I do use it that way to say it's at the very end of the street.</p>
<p id="p-96">Yeah,</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-97">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-98">So the listener examples from Sophia, so not sure where they're from, but let's just give them and then we're going to talk about it.</p>
<p id="p-99">So again, this is the very book I was looking for.</p>
<p id="p-100">So here it means, as Aubrey said, the exact book.</p>
<p id="p-101">So it's kind of more emphatic.</p>
<p id="p-102">I could just say, this is the book I was looking for, but saying this is the very book I was looking for.</p>
<p id="p-103">It adds more feeling.</p>
<p id="p-104">It's a bit more interesting and intense.</p>
<p id="p-105">Maybe you were looking for a very long time, or maybe your friend had it and it's a coincidence she had the same book.</p>
<p id="p-106">In some way, it's surprising to you or shocking potentially.</p>
<p id="p-107">Yeah, maybe you're wanting to like help this friend feel especially good about finding exactly what you needed.</p>
<p id="p-108">So you add this to emphasize.</p>
<p id="p-109">It's sort of a way to express gratitude, I feel like, right?</p>
<p id="p-110">Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-111">So here's another example that would</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-112">So here's another example that would be used in this way.</p>
<p id="p-113">So that is the very restaurant I was researching earlier.</p>
<p id="p-114">Yes, and I would say that as well, right?</p>
<p id="p-115">That is the very thing I was thinking of.</p>
<p id="p-116">So interchangeable with exact, but yeah, I definitely hear this sometimes for sure.</p>
<p id="p-117">Right, so now let's go.</p>
<p id="p-118">Aubrey, you want to tell us a little bit about at the very end of the road?</p>
<p id="p-119">Yeah, so this next example, at the very end of the road, you'll find the old house.</p>
<p id="p-120">This is emphasizing that it's the point at which you can't go any further, right?</p>
<p id="p-121">The very end of the road.</p>
<p id="p-122">So that can be used to talk about extremes.</p>
<p id="p-123">And this is much more common.</p>
<p id="p-124">I use this a lot.</p>
<p id="p-125">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-126">So for example, she turned in her paper at the very last minute.</p>
<p id="p-127">So yeah, that kind of means exact, but it's also just the minute at which, before, if she finished it any later.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-128">If she finished it any later, it would have been late, right?</p>
<p id="p-129">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-130">It has the same meaning as ultimate, but we don't use ultimate that way, oddly enough.</p>
<p id="p-131">It has that definition, but we wouldn't say she turned in her paper at the ultimate minute.</p>
<p id="p-132">We don't. Instead, we say the very last minute.</p>
<p id="p-133">Right, So we can generally think of, I mean, overall, it's pretty much the same idea, but these two kinds of buckets.</p>
<p id="p-134">So there may be more, but we're going to stick with these examples, but this is certainly enough to start with.</p>
<p id="p-135">So we're going to continue in just a second.</p>
<p id="p-136">Okay, so let's review the two ways that we were touching on so far.</p>
<p id="p-137">So the first one is to be emphatic, exact, maybe a little bit of a shock.</p>
<p id="p-138">And let's do some more examples to really hammer this home.</p>
<p id="p-139">Aubrey, what's the first one?</p>
<p id="p-140">Yeah, I might say that is the very dress I was thinking of wearing tonight.</p>
<p id="p-141">If maybe your friend showed up in that same party dress you have on, or maybe they chose...</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-142">you have on, or maybe they chose one for you out of the closet to suggest it, say, that is the very one I was planning on wearing.</p>
<p id="p-143">Yeah, so it's a little bit different than just saying, that is the dress I was thinking of wearing tonight.</p>
<p id="p-144">This kind of puts a little bit of an extra something, a little bit of style to what you're saying to show that this is impactful, meaningful, a little bit of a surprise.</p>
<p id="p-145">Yeah, kind of emphasizing the coincidence of it, right?</p>
<p id="p-146">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-147">It's like we're wanting to point out like, what a funny coincidence.</p>
<p id="p-148">And we can do all of that by just adding very.</p>
<p id="p-149">Right, so interesting how just that one little word can really change how the sentence sounds.</p>
<p id="p-150">Here, let's do another one.</p>
<p id="p-151">That is the very reason I didn't want to go to this museum today.</p>
<p id="p-152">It's too crowded.</p>
<p id="p-153">Oh, this is good.</p>
<p id="p-154">We would definitely do this, right?</p>
<p id="p-155">You're emphasizing, you probably did not want to go.</p>
<p id="p-156">It's almost like saying, I told you so.</p>
<p id="p-157">This is why I did not want to go.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-158">is why I did not want to go.</p>
<p id="p-159">Exactly, exactly, right.</p>
<p id="p-160">It is very much like saying, I told you so.</p>
<p id="p-161">So again, both of these are pretty related, but we're going to go over to the other context.</p>
<p id="p-162">So again, the second one was a certain extreme or a point.</p>
<p id="p-163">So I'll do the first example.</p>
<p id="p-164">There's a twist at the very end of the movie.</p>
<p id="p-165">I couldn't believe it.</p>
<p id="p-166">Yes, and this is not like you're really emphasizing that it's right at the very end.</p>
<p id="p-167">So this wouldn't be like 10 minutes before the movie ended.</p>
<p id="p-168">This would be like in the final seconds, the final minute.</p>
<p id="p-169">And then another example, Paul has been my very best friend since first grade.</p>
<p id="p-170">So yeah, this again emphasizes it, right?</p>
<p id="p-171">That you may have had other friends, but not only was he your best friend, you want to emphasize how close you are by saying very best friend.</p>
<p id="p-172">Or she found her ring at the very bottom of the suitcase.</p>
<p id="p-173">So right before the suitcase ends, it was</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-174">case ends, it was at the bottom.</p>
<p id="p-175">So again, this is, again, they're both pretty much the same way of using it, but one is a little bit more about an extreme point and what the other one is slightly more just exact.</p>
<p id="p-176">But don't really worry about completely the difference between these two, just focus on the meaning here.</p>
<p id="p-177">I mean, Aubrey, why could these be useful for connection?</p>
<p id="p-178">Yeah, I love what we mentioned a moment ago that if you're wanting to emphasize how much of a coincidence something is, it's really fun to use it that way.</p>
<p id="p-179">And if you're also wanting to sort of compliment someone, right, that they're able to guess something or they knew something, this is a really fun, playful way to do that.</p>
<p id="p-180">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-181">So let's talk about some other ways you might be able to say this, maybe a little bit more for the first context.</p>
<p id="p-182">Now, the first one is exact, which we've been saying this whole time, right?</p>
<p id="p-183">So you could do that.</p>
<p id="p-184">So that is the exact reason I wanted to talk today.</p>
<p id="p-185">Or you could say exactly the reason, right?</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-186">completely the reason, right?</p>
<p id="p-187">Yeah, and some people will have a tendency to say one of these or the other.</p>
<p id="p-188">Many people will say both.</p>
<p id="p-189">They're definitely interchangeable.</p>
<p id="p-190">Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-191">Now I'm just saying it.</p>
<p id="p-192">So those are the two that vary and exact that we're focusing on today.</p>
<p id="p-193">So should we put it all together in a role play?</p>
<p id="p-194">Yes, it looks like you work at the front desk of a doctor's office and I come in.</p>
<p id="p-195">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-196">All right, so I'll start us off.</p>
<p id="p-197">Hello, do you have an appointment today?</p>
<p id="p-198">Yes, I'm Aubrey Carter.</p>
<p id="p-199">My appointment is at two.</p>
<p id="p-200">Sorry, I'm here at the very last minute.</p>
<p id="p-201">Oh, that's okay.</p>
<p id="p-202">Oh, wow.</p>
<p id="p-203">Are you reading that book?</p>
<p id="p-204">Yes, I love it so far.</p>
<p id="p-205">That's the very same book I just got from the library.</p>
<p id="p-206">So funny.</p>
<p id="p-207">It's the exact book I was looking for.</p>
<p id="p-208">You'll love it.</p>
<p id="p-209">Oh, sorry.</p>
<p id="p-210">Is there a restroom here?</p>
<p id="p-211">Of course, very last door on the right.</p>
<p id="p-212">Thanks.</p>
<p id="p-213">Oh, this is really good.</p>
<p id="p-214">Lots of good natural</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-215">Lots of good natural uses for all of these.</p>
<p id="p-216">Exactly, lots of them in here today.</p>
<p id="p-217">So, okay.</p>
<p id="p-218">I said, no, you said, sorry, I'm here at the very last minute.</p>
<p id="p-219">So basically at the minute at which if you were any later, maybe I would have given the appointment to someone else.</p>
<p id="p-220">Right, right.</p>
<p id="p-221">Like maybe if it starts at two, she might've gotten there right at 1.59 or even like 2.03, right?</p>
<p id="p-222">Right, And this happened to me yesterday.</p>
<p id="p-223">I took my daughter to get a haircut and they were about to close.</p>
<p id="p-224">I didn't realize.</p>
<p id="p-225">And I think they said something very similar, like, oh, you got here at the very last minute before we would have said, nope, no more tonight.</p>
<p id="p-226">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-227">Yes, And then what did I say about the book?</p>
<p id="p-228">Yeah, you said that's the very same book I just got from the library.</p>
<p id="p-229">And this is interesting.</p>
<p id="p-230">You could just say, that's the very book I got from the library, but often we'll add same.</p>
<p id="p-231">Either way means the same thing.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-232">Either way means the same thing.</p>
<p id="p-233">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-234">Or now I keep on saying exactly and it's bothering.</p>
<p id="p-235">I can't stop myself.</p>
<p id="p-236">Okay, and then you said it's the exact book I was looking for.</p>
<p id="p-237">So maybe it's exactly the genre you like.</p>
<p id="p-238">You were hoping for a page turner.</p>
<p id="p-239">So it's the exact book I was looking for.</p>
<p id="p-240">Yeah, and this is interesting because exact is a tricky word where sometimes it's not clear if you mean that exact title or like the exact genre like you're saying, Michelle, like the exact type of book.</p>
<p id="p-241">But also interesting that we could say very here.</p>
<p id="p-242">It's the very book I was looking for.</p>
<p id="p-243">But that would probably, I would assume they meant the exact title if they say very, wouldn't you?</p>
<p id="p-244">Yeah, that's what I would think.</p>
<p id="p-245">Yeah, right.</p>
<p id="p-246">If we switched them and yeah, so saying that's the very same book I got from the library, I'm saying the very same title, right?</p>
<p id="p-247">It is, right?</p>
<p id="p-248">But if you say it's the exact book I was looking for, to me it screams genre.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-249">extremes genre.</p>
<p id="p-250">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-251">It's like I was looking for a mystery and that's exactly what I got.</p>
<p id="p-252">Yeah, Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-253">And then you say, oh, sorry, is there a restroom here?</p>
<p id="p-254">And I said, of course, very last door on the right.</p>
<p id="p-255">So at the point at which you can't continue down the hall, that's the one.</p>
<p id="p-256">Yeah, that is interesting.</p>
<p id="p-257">We say you could just say last door on the right, but we will say this too.</p>
<p id="p-258">Very last door on the right.</p>
<p id="p-259">Kind of to really emphasize.</p>
<p id="p-260">Yeah, Maybe the one before that is like someone's office and they accidentally go there sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-261">So you're wanting to make sure they go to the very last door.</p>
<p id="p-262">Yes, Right, You don't want them to barge in on a meeting or whatever.</p>
<p id="p-263">Yeah, Very good.</p>
<p id="p-264">Very good.</p>
<p id="p-265">Guys, head on over to episode 2356 of All Ears English.</p>
<p id="p-266">That was learn some new English while you're at it.</p>
<p id="p-267">And Aubrey, any takeaways for you today?</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-268">Any takeaways for you today?</p>
<p id="p-269">Yeah, I love this vocab.</p>
<p id="p-270">I love that you did the deep dive to kind of think about these and how we use them.</p>
<p id="p-271">This is the type of vocabulary that native English speakers don't stop and think about.</p>
<p id="p-272">You know, do I use very or exact or and what do they mean?</p>
<p id="p-273">So this I always love this to have something weird about English highlighted like this.</p>
<p id="p-274">Same here.</p>
<p id="p-275">And it's fun even as a native speaker to really have to think about my own language in a different way.</p>
<p id="p-276">Because like you said, most people aren't thinking about what is the difference between these two.</p>
<p id="p-277">But we get to really get into it and consider our language in a different way.</p>
<p id="p-278">Right, I'm excited for you guys to use these, use both of them to just add some spice, add some flavor to your language.</p>
<p id="p-279">It's fun.</p>
<p id="p-280">Yes, All right.</p>
<p id="p-281">Well, I guess we've reached the very end, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-282">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-283">I like what you did there.</p>
<p id="p-284">Thank you.</p>
<p id="p-285">Awesome.</p>
<p id="p-286">I'll see you next time, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-287">All right.</p>
<p id="p-288">Bye, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-289">Thanks.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-290">All right.</p>
