<p>How are you Lindsay? Feeling good? I'll be recording today on a Wednesday.</p>
<p>So, all good Michelle.</p>
<p>I have a question for you though.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>I have a question for you though.</p>
<p>You ready? Ok.</p>
<p>Let's hear it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So, which do you like better? The sunrise or the sunset? Which is your favorite? Um, I'm going to go sunset because I'm a night person.</p>
<p>So I don't often see the sunrise I could with my kids, but I, I don't, I don't think I can since I'm not a morning person.</p>
<p>I don't think I can absorb it in the same way and enjoy it.</p>
<p>Um, that someone who is a morning person can, but I love the sunset.</p>
<p>What about you? Lindsay the sunset? I've seen more beautiful sunsets because they're easier to see.</p>
<p>Right, You go out and you happen to be somewhere.</p>
<p>But I love the sunrise.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But the sunrise for me is, wow.</p>
<p>It's like so magical.</p>
<p>It's more symbolic.</p>
<p>It's the beginning of a day and it just, it's usually more orange.</p>
<p>I feel like it's the sunrise for me.</p>
<p>It's, oh, that's a good 10, that's a good one to teach you.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>To teach like when people say it's the something for me.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, yes, 100 percent.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Guys look out for that episode hit follow and that'll happen.</p>
<p>So anyway, um well, today we are going to get into it because we have a great listener question about some sunny words.</p>
<p>So before we get into that, we want to let you know, we had this great episode.</p>
<p>Uh episode 2264 of the All E English podcast was going through any earth shattering changes.</p>
<p>So go ahead and listen to that one.</p>
<p>Yes, good stuff.</p>
<p>And today we had a question for today's episode.</p>
<p>This comes from a question from our youtube channel, which by the way, if you guys go over our videos, these episodes are over on youtube.</p>
<p>So go and check it out Michelle.</p>
<p>If you want to see us today, Michelle, you have some funky headphones on today.</p>
<p>Yes, I am so sorry that these are the headphones I'm wearing, but I am wearing.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>Headphones I'm wearing, but I am wearing uh children's blue headphones.</p>
<p>So that's not.</p>
<p>We improvise to make it work.</p>
<p>Here at all is English, we're here for you.</p>
<p>But if you want to check out my cool headphones, uh go on over and watch us on youtube, go and check it out guys.</p>
<p>All right, I'm going to read our students question and Michelle, are you ready for the question? Here we go.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So this comes from wa 8269 and they said I love to wander around outside at 7 a.m.</p>
<p>watching the sunrise.</p>
<p>But I wonder about the differences between these two words, sunrise and sunshine.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I feel like I would see, I see eye to eye with this student.</p>
<p>This listener wandering around at sunrise.</p>
<p>That's what I do with my dog.</p>
<p>Every morning.</p>
<p>We go to the park and we wander, we meet neighbors.</p>
<p>It's so beautiful.</p>
<p>That's nice.</p>
<p>That's nice.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm not so much of a 7 a.m.</p>
<p>one.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>I'm not so much of a 7 a.m.</p>
<p>Wanderer, but I still think it's great.</p>
<p>I can understand the appeal.</p>
<p>Um So anyway, well, this is a really good question and this is very useful because this is a good conversation topic as well.</p>
<p>And I realize just how often we use words like sun or sunshine in the English language.</p>
<p>So there's a lot to get to today.</p>
<p>So let's get into it, Lindsay.</p>
<p>So what is sunrise? Ok.</p>
<p>So sunrise is the time time when the sun comes up, right? So 6 a.m.</p>
<p>seven AM maybe 5:30 a.m.</p>
<p>depending on the time of year, it always changes.</p>
<p>Uh And depending on where you're located, right? Uh And so you might say let's wake up early to see the sunrise.</p>
<p>There's been a few times in my life when I've tried to see the sunrise in special places like Mount Fuji.</p>
<p>You know, the top of Mount Fuji, you know, the idea is you climb at 4 p.m.</p>
<p>you start about 4 p.m.</p>
<p>you make it to the top by sun.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>4 p.m.</p>
<p>you make it to the top by sunrise, uh the next day and you're up there and you can see, uh, it's just supposed to be amazing.</p>
<p>Of course, the day that we did it, uh, it was pure clouds and not the good kind of clouds that make the sunrise amazing and pink.</p>
<p>The kind of clouds is just a gray wall.</p>
<p>Oh, no, that's too bad.</p>
<p>Maybe another time.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have some friends who had some amazing photos from another trip and so there's been other times when I wanted to do that when you're in a special place, you know? Right, Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>It's usually you're on vacation.</p>
<p>Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>So, what about sunshine? How is that different? Well, sunshine is just kind of the general sun any time of the day.</p>
<p>Right, Michelle.</p>
<p>So, for example, I love being out in the summer sunshine.</p>
<p>It's not about a specific time of day.</p>
<p>Uh It's just that feeling of the sun coming on your, on your face.</p>
<p>Right, Right, So when this listener</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>Right? So when this listener talks about wandering around outside are at 7 a.m.</p>
<p>are they most likely seeing the sunrise, the sunshine or both? Like if they wanted to tell somebody about what they're doing, what would they say? Do you think? I think sunrise more so than sunshine? Maybe at 10 a.m.</p>
<p>then they're really feeling the sunshine because the sun has moved more towards the middle of the sky.</p>
<p>Right? Michelle, you're feeling the full effects of it.</p>
<p>Like yesterday, I sat outside in my front porch at 2 p.m.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, the sun was insanely strong.</p>
<p>I came back with like a sunburn after sitting out there for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Michelle, it was wild, you know.</p>
<p>Well, that's a good thing that you just said.</p>
<p>I mean, I'm sorry about the sunburn.</p>
<p>But, um, the sun being strong, that's something that we say that the sun is strong when it's really, really coming down at you and there is no shade.</p>
<p>It's just so that's a good thing that you can use, you could say.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>You can use, you could say if you're outside, you could say, oh, the sun is really strong today.</p>
<p>Let's make sure we put on our suntan lotion.</p>
<p>Yes, big time.</p>
<p>And I, I do notice out here in Colorado, the sun is much stronger than other parts of the country because of the altitude that we're at here.</p>
<p>Right? So we're just physically a little closer to the sun.</p>
<p>Uh And so you could just feel it so much more.</p>
<p>It's crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right, I bet.</p>
<p>So the, so the other difference I just realized is the sunrise is really only something you look at.</p>
<p>Like it's the, the feel is more about seeing the sunrise, the sunshine, you can see the sunshine, but you also feel the sunshine.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's true.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that makes sense.</p>
<p>You might feel with sunrise, you might feel that it's starting to get warmer, right? You can, you can kind of feel like you see, especially a very visible sunrise, you see it come up and you can feel that warmth, right? But yeah, sunshine is a more physical feeling.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>Is a more physical feeling as well as a visual.</p>
<p>What about a personality, Michelle? Let's flip over to talking about people.</p>
<p>I mean, is there a way to talk about someone who is cheerful related to the sun? I mean, well, you couldn't say that someone has a sunny disposition disposition.</p>
<p>Do you ever hear that? I have heard that before.</p>
<p>What is disposition? Disposition? That's a mouthful of that word.</p>
<p>It's basically their personality the way they see the world, just their natural state.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Their default, right? Glass, half, half empty, half glass, half full.</p>
<p>We could say that too.</p>
<p>Um So for example, a bright, happy, nice personality.</p>
<p>She generally has a sunny disposition, but she's been down in the dumps about her job lately, down in the dumps.</p>
<p>That's a key word.</p>
<p>That's probably going to be in the app for our premium users here.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>For our premium users here.</p>
<p>What does that mean? I mean, I guess we can know based on the words.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's basically sad if w w blah had had an expression, that's what it would be down in the dump.</p>
<p>Yes, I love it.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>Ok, Michelle.</p>
<p>So we're back and what would be the next one? Ok.</p>
<p>Another thing you can say about the sun is to go out and catch some sun, catch it.</p>
<p>So what does that mean? Are you, I mean, you can't catch the sun.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yeah, you never.</p>
<p>Right, And we're not going to try to either when we say this so to catch some sun is to basically absorb the sun, right? To be out in the sun maybe to work on your tan or just i it kind of means to like live life a bit right.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, wouldn't you say Michelle? Yeah, I would, I, to me, I hear it more like just about being out in the sun.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>Just about being out in the sun.</p>
<p>Oh, let's go catch some sun.</p>
<p>Uh, it's, it's really nice outside.</p>
<p>Let's go catch some sun.</p>
<p>Maybe we can have a picnic, right.</p>
<p>Let's go outside and catch some sun.</p>
<p>The weather is finally beautiful.</p>
<p>Maybe it's been raining for days and days and days.</p>
<p>We had a week like that.</p>
<p>Who? That? Yeah, that's really hard.</p>
<p>Rainy days, rainy weeks and then the sun comes out, you're going to go out and catch some sun.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>And then under the sun, I love this one.</p>
<p>Everything under the sun.</p>
<p>Now, what does this mean? This is totally different in the meaning? Um So this means all possibilities, everything.</p>
<p>So this isn't really a focus on being in the sun or anything like that.</p>
<p>This is saying everything under the sun.</p>
<p>So what's under the sun? Everything.</p>
<p>So it's this idea metaphorically that all possibilities are open.</p>
<p>Um, e everything, anything you want.</p>
<p>So, it</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>Anything you want.</p>
<p>So it could be even like this, you should check out the new eatery on third.</p>
<p>They have everything under the sun.</p>
<p>It's an amazing menu.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So this idea of anything that exists or everything that exists is everything under the sun.</p>
<p>They have so many choices.</p>
<p>Right, Yes, Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So, I think that's a, I mean, all of these are really common.</p>
<p>Do you have a favorite of these Lindsey? Let's see.</p>
<p>I, well, I mean, I really like, I like the expression, everything under the sun.</p>
<p>Um, it reminds me of the expression, everything but the kitchen sink or the kitchen sink, which, which we should do that another day.</p>
<p>That is a great one.</p>
<p>Hit the follow button on all English because that is a crazy one that we'll come back to.</p>
<p>It's confusing but it, it's great.</p>
<p>It's classic.</p>
<p>Um So that idea that everything is engulfed under this idea.</p>
<p>So that's my favorite Michelle.</p>
<p>Which one is yours? Um.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>Um Which one is my favorite? Um I'm gonna say I'm going to agree with you.</p>
<p>I think that's the most fun.</p>
<p>Everything under the sun to me, that's the most fun.</p>
<p>But also, you know, before we get into the role play, what is the opposite of sunrise? Well, sunset, right? Sunrise, sunset.</p>
<p>Yeah, sunrise, sunset guys.</p>
<p>So just in case you didn't know that one, that's the opposite.</p>
<p>So, all right.</p>
<p>Should we do a role play? Well, actually, before we get into the role play, Michel, I have a question here.</p>
<p>Here's an interesting philosophical question.</p>
<p>So, do you think that places that get more sunshine people are friendlier? Like, let's imagine, like more outgoing, more sociable, more connected, what would you say? Or warmer places? I'm not sure if it would be both would come together.</p>
<p>What are your theories on that? Wow.</p>
<p>I have never thought about.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I have never thought about that.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I don't know if I believe that actually because I, I mean, yeah, I think people are generally happier but when you think about what did they say, the happiest places in the world, what is it Copenhagen, I think, for quality of life.</p>
<p>But it's just that, I don't know that, I mean, that's a place where there's a lot of darkness, you know, when the time changes and, you know, I don't know that that's like the sunniest place.</p>
<p>I don't, I don't know for sure, but I know that it gets dark early in the winter, things like that.</p>
<p>Um, so to me, I think it's more embedded in the society and, um, maybe some stuff to do with the government and how things are handled, uh, overall philosophies, ways of looking at life.</p>
<p>So, I don't know that it's so much the weather but I don't think that hurts.</p>
<p>I think, I do think it helps.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>I think, I do think it helps.</p>
<p>What do you think? Yeah, I think there's, I think it's a difference between overall health and wellness, which would be something like Scandinavia.</p>
<p>They do that really well.</p>
<p>Right, Everything's taken care of.</p>
<p>They're in a good spot versus maybe disposition.</p>
<p>Like, what is your default disposition? Because I can tell you in Boston people are not waving on the street and saying, like there's smiling.</p>
<p>No, not, not really.</p>
<p>Um, and Boston is kind of, at least in the winter it's a dark cold place.</p>
<p>Right, So, versus maybe in a place like California or, I mean, Colorado too.</p>
<p>People are definitely, they smile at you on the street.</p>
<p>Right, Some of that could be urban versus rural too.</p>
<p>But I, I think about this a lot, you know, does the weather or the sunshine affect people's personalities in different places? So there's wellness and then there's personality and disposition.</p>
<p>I think it's maybe different.</p>
<p>Right, Right, Uh, I definitely, I, I, I definitely noticed</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>Definitely, I, I, I definitely noticed that when the weather is nice, I'm in a better mood.</p>
<p>Uh, even, even when you go to see a place like a new town, let's say you're just going for the day to get lunch in a new town and it's raining.</p>
<p>That town is gonna look totally different than if you go on a nice day and your impression of it and your feel for it will certainly be different.</p>
<p>I mean, your entire week.</p>
<p>Yeah, you go for a weekend away to anywhere, the memory and the feeling of that whole weekend is going to be complete 100% Michelle.</p>
<p>So maybe this will be a poll question for today, right.</p>
<p>This is a great one.</p>
<p>we'll come back to this in the poll guys.</p>
<p>Make sure you're participating in the Spotify polls so your voice can be heard too.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Yes, we have fun.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>In this role play Michelle.</p>
<p>What are we doing? Ok.</p>
<p>Um, you are a bookstore owner and I am looking at books in the store.</p>
<p>Ok, here we go.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p>Oh, all right.</p>
<p>You start us off.</p>
<p>Ok, here we go.</p>
<p>This place is great.</p>
<p>Do you have any historical fiction? Oh, yes, we have everything under the sun.</p>
<p>It's all over in the corner.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Do you always read historical fiction? I read everything but I do love that genre.</p>
<p>I just love to read.</p>
<p>Oh, same here.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is to get up at sunrise and look out with a cup of coffee and a good book.</p>
<p>Well, that maybe that's why you have such a sunny disposition.</p>
<p>I love to sit out by the pool and read while I catch some sun.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Well, that's great too.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>So, two big readers here in this conversation, right? All right, good.</p>
<p>So we used our keywords today in a couple of different places.</p>
<p>So you asked me, do you have any historical fiction? And I said, oh, yes, we have everything under the sun.</p>
<p>So, what am I saying there? Michelle, am I saying? Every, every</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p>Am I saying? Every, every title or every, every kind of genre? Yeah, I'm saying? Yeah, we have historical fiction and we have horror and we have suspense and thriller and all these other things.</p>
<p>Right, Yes, Good.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And then I said my favorite thing is to get up at sunrise and look out with a cup of coffee and a good book.</p>
<p>So I like to wake up early in this magical mystical universe.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Because I don't know.</p>
<p>I did that right.</p>
<p>It sounds nice.</p>
<p>Right, It sounds very, I don't know, poetic, peaceful.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Um, my favorite thing is to get up at sunrise.</p>
<p>Right, Oh, sorry.</p>
<p>I said that again.</p>
<p>Let's try the next one.</p>
<p>Maybe that's why you have such a sunny disposition.</p>
<p>Right, Sunny disposition.</p>
<p>Maybe that's why you seem so.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Cheerful.</p>
<p>Right, Yes, Exactly.</p>
<p>And then you said, I love to sit up by the pool and read while I catch some sun.</p>
<p>Not.</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p>Catch some sun.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Ok, so it's pretty self explanatory.</p>
<p>I think these phrases fit really nicely.</p>
<p>Michelle into a conversation, right? So sunshine in our lives.</p>
<p>What's a takeaway for today? Well, we wish you guys a lot of sunshine and happiness and these are all really useful.</p>
<p>These are all very, very common.</p>
<p>Um And it's good to talk about some of these topics of it's a good conversation question and makes people think, oh, do you prefer the sunrise or the sunset? Um It's just different ways to use the sun to talk about many different things in English or talking about the conversation that we opened in the middle of the episode.</p>
<p>What effect does the sun have on mental health? What effect does it have on your skin? Right, I just went to the dermatologist yesterday for my biyearly skin check, right? We have to do that if we get a lot of sun where we live.</p>
<p>Yes, for sure.</p>
<p>So the sun impacts us in so many ways.</p>
<h2>Part-21</h2>
<p>Sun impacts us in so many ways.</p>
<p>So open those conversations, guys.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>All right, great question.</p>
<p>Thanks so much.</p>
<p>And guys, we'll see you on the next one.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>See you later.</p>
<p>Michelle.</p>
