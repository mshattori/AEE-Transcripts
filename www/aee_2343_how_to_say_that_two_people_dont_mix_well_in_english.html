<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p id="p-8">Do you have any friends who simply don't get along?</p>
<p id="p-9">What can you say when two people don't mix well?</p>
<p id="p-10">Listen in today.</p>
<p id="p-11">Hey there, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-12">What's shaking?</p>
<p id="p-13">Nothing.</p>
<p id="p-14">Lindsay, what is your favorite type of oil to use for cooking?</p>
<p id="p-15">Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-16">It's olive oil.</p>
<p id="p-17">I really like olive oil, but sometimes I know you're not supposed to use it to cook with everything, but I want to use it most of the time.</p>
<p id="p-18">What about you?</p>
<p id="p-19">Yeah, I know.</p>
<p id="p-20">There's a whole science with the boiling point and everything.</p>
<p id="p-21">Do you know about that?</p>
<p id="p-22">Not really, but I know you're not supposed to make it too hot, but I still do that.</p>
<p id="p-23">I also cook with avocado oil now, but I've been trying to avoid vegetable oil and different things.</p>
<p id="p-24">Yeah, me too.</p>
<p id="p-25">Me too.</p>
<p id="p-26">Sometimes I like avocado oil.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-27">me too.</p>
<p id="p-28">Sometimes I like avocado oil, but it doesn't have too much taste to it.</p>
<p id="p-29">Does that make sense?</p>
<p id="p-30">Like for me, in my mind, it doesn't. But it's a good other option.</p>
<p id="p-31">Like if you're cooking eggs or something, it can work.</p>
<p id="p-32">That's what I cook my eggs in every morning.</p>
<p id="p-33">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-34">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-35">So today we are going to talk about an expression and dealing with oil and how you can use it in your conversation.</p>
<p id="p-36">So, Lindsay, oil and water, can they mix?</p>
<p id="p-37">Not really.</p>
<p id="p-38">When I think of oil and water, I think of them kind of separating, separating out in a bottle if you try to mix them.</p>
<p id="p-39">Yeah, Yeah, No, that probably wouldn't work.</p>
<p id="p-40">So why are you asking me that question, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-41">Are we getting into science today?</p>
<p id="p-42">Well, a little science experiment.</p>
<p id="p-43">Maybe we should pull out our test tubes.</p>
<p id="p-44">So something that is commonly said is that people are like oil and water.</p>
<p id="p-45">And this expression means what you would think it means.</p>
<p id="p-46">It means that they can't mix.</p>
<p id="p-47">Either they're just</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-48">means that they can't mix.</p>
<p id="p-49">Either they're just polar opposites, which is another good vocabulary word, or they just don't get along.</p>
<p id="p-50">So to me, I would use it more about people not getting along.</p>
<p id="p-51">What do you think, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-52">Yeah, Do you have anyone like this in your life?</p>
<p id="p-53">Two people that you care about that you try to bring together, Michelle, and they just don't get along?</p>
<p id="p-54">It just doesn't work?</p>
<p id="p-55">I know some people who are like oil and water.</p>
<p id="p-56">What about you?</p>
<p id="p-57">Yeah, I think I do too.</p>
<p id="p-58">I've never really tried to bring them together necessarily or successfully, but the world is full of different interesting people, right?</p>
<p id="p-59">I'm not sure that everyone is meant to necessarily fit together perfectly, right?</p>
<p id="p-60">Right, right, right.</p>
<p id="p-61">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-62">So guys, we also want to remind you before we get into it a little bit more to get the All Ears English app, right, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-63">I love this app.</p>
<p id="p-64">Oh, it's fantastic.</p>
<p id="p-65">Guys, if you want a way to listen to the podcast, but then to get transcripts right in front of you and be able to tap on keywords, see meanings, save the words.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-66">meanings, save the words, view role-play reviews of every week.</p>
<p id="p-67">I mean, there's so much in there, guys.</p>
<p id="p-68">Yes, Michelle, how can you go and get the app right now?</p>
<p id="p-69">Go to allearsenglish.com slash app.</p>
<p id="p-70">That's A-P-P. Yeah, it would be a great way to start off the year by becoming a premium member, and you can do a seven-day free trial.</p>
<p id="p-71">So you can try out these features that I'm talking about and see for yourself that you can't get them anywhere else.</p>
<p id="p-72">All right?</p>
<p id="p-73">So, allearsenglish.com slash A-P-P. Good.</p>
<p id="p-74">Right, All right.</p>
<p id="p-75">So, yeah, sometimes this can make me think of siblings, right?</p>
<p id="p-76">So either siblings are completely different or they don't get along.</p>
<p id="p-77">A lot of times you hear about people not getting along with their siblings.</p>
<p id="p-78">What do you think?</p>
<p id="p-79">I was just having dinner with my brother on Monday night.</p>
<p id="p-80">He was in town, and we were talking about how we really haven't been that close over the years, but his wife is super close now with her brothers and sisters.</p>
<p id="p-81">So that was kind of interesting, but I think usually brothers and sisters ...</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-82">of interesting, but I think usually brothers and sisters and sisters, siblings tend to be quite different.</p>
<p id="p-83">I mean, it's weird how that happens, but it's true.</p>
<p id="p-84">So it wouldn't be true necessarily that you'd be super close with your sibling, right?</p>
<p id="p-85">Right, It's not a given.</p>
<p id="p-86">Yeah, it's not a given.</p>
<p id="p-87">I mean, even with dogs, like it does keep her get along with other dogs or are they like oil and water?</p>
<p id="p-88">No, he's great with other dogs.</p>
<p id="p-89">There's one dog that he doesn't seem to like, and it's very weird.</p>
<p id="p-90">We'll walk past this apartment and this dog is on an overhang patio kind of thing, and the dog will go nuts and Kiefer will go nuts and they'll bark at each other.</p>
<p id="p-91">That's the only dog I've ever seen him have issues with.</p>
<p id="p-92">Every other dog he loves.</p>
<p id="p-93">Yeah, that's interesting.</p>
<p id="p-94">You know what else I think of?</p>
<p id="p-95">Maybe divorced parents.</p>
<p id="p-96">So yes, my partner's parents are divorced and one Thanksgiving we had a big old Thanksgiving.</p>
<p id="p-97">My partner's dad hosted and my partner's mom came with</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-98">my partner's mom came with her new husband with her husband and you know they're just yeah you know the divorcees are just kind of oil and water they just yeah i mean there's a reason there was a divorce right it is yeah yeah yeah exactly oh wow yeah no that can be that can be awkward i guess yeah for sure it's kind of funny but that's okay that's okay what else yeah okay so um i think that this could be actually a really good connection expression because it can explain your background your personality right yeah or what else could it do lindsay i mean it could be good for connection for sure like you said to explain where you come from what kind of person you are and who you don't do and don't get along with you could be warning someone about someone else's relationship like let's say you're about to go to a party and maybe the couple that's hosting are having a hard time getting along or something right and they're like rolling water or they're two random friends that are coming that you don't know</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-99">or they're two random friends that are coming that you just know are going to be oil and water, right?</p>
<p id="p-100">Right, So but yeah, or yeah, somebody just went through a breakup, a divorce, and you know, they're both going to be at the same party.</p>
<p id="p-101">So you might say, Oh, they're really like oil and water right now.</p>
<p id="p-102">So maybe you try and keep her over there.</p>
<p id="p-103">The other one will be over here.</p>
<p id="p-104">So yeah, these are important things, conversations to have that friends need to support their friends and make sure that things go over smoothly at the party.</p>
<p id="p-105">Yeah, yes, yes.</p>
<p id="p-106">Or it could be good for just telling a story, you know, um, you know, sharing that somebody didn't get along.</p>
<p id="p-107">So you could just say, Oh, and I was with I was with this crowd.</p>
<p id="p-108">And it turned out that these two people were like oil and water.</p>
<p id="p-109">And so we did blah, blah, blah, right?</p>
<p id="p-110">Yeah, those are good examples.</p>
<p id="p-111">What else do we have any specific examples?</p>
<p id="p-112">Yeah, let's do a couple.</p>
<p id="p-113">So my brother and I are like oil and water.</p>
<p id="p-114">We only talk once or twice a year.</p>
<p id="p-115">And I've talked about that I'm very close with my brother.</p>
<p id="p-116">So I want to say that's true.</p>
<p id="p-117">But oh, yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-118">Or I</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-119">Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-120">Or I thought I would love having two dogs, but they get along like oil and water.</p>
<p id="p-121">It's not so fun.</p>
<p id="p-122">Oh, that sounds hard.</p>
<p id="p-123">Sounds difficult to keep them separated.</p>
<p id="p-124">Yeah, Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-125">Or she doesn't get along with her roommate.</p>
<p id="p-126">They're like oil and water, so try not to bring it up.</p>
<p id="p-127">Did you get along with your freshman year roommate in college, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-128">I know we've touched on, you know, college.</p>
<p id="p-129">Uh-huh.</p>
<p id="p-130">But did you get along with your freshman year roommate?</p>
<p id="p-131">I did.</p>
<p id="p-132">I did.</p>
<p id="p-133">We got along.</p>
<p id="p-134">I had a little bit of a hard first semester.</p>
<p id="p-135">I was very homesick, I think I've talked about.</p>
<p id="p-136">But then second semester, I felt a lot better, a lot more like myself.</p>
<p id="p-137">So we got along.</p>
<p id="p-138">We don't, we're Facebook friends.</p>
<p id="p-139">We don't really, we don't keep in touch.</p>
<p id="p-140">But I have like mostly, I have positive associations with her.</p>
<p id="p-141">What about you?</p>
<p id="p-142">Yeah, we got along.</p>
<p id="p-143">We weren't really friends.</p>
<p id="p-144">We didn't hang out.</p>
<p id="p-145">But, you know, I had my own friends and she had her own friends.</p>
<p id="p-146">But we definitely got along.</p>
<p id="p-147">There wasn't much drama.</p>
<p id="p-148">Thank goodness.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-149">along.</p>
<p id="p-150">There wasn't much drama, thank goodness, because college dorms are very small.</p>
<p id="p-151">Yes, they are.</p>
<p id="p-152">All right, Michelle, before we get into some more examples and potentially a role play later on, I do want to call out a couple of our reviewers.</p>
<p id="p-153">You know, Michelle, we've been getting a lot of amazing five-star reviews for All Ears English.</p>
<p id="p-154">What do you think about that?</p>
<p id="p-155">Thanks, guys.</p>
<p id="p-156">Oh, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-157">Yes, thank you.</p>
<p id="p-158">So a special shout out to Anonymous on December 5th, Ivana Charley on December 4th, and Daniel Zaza on December 4th in Apple Podcasts, as well as Silly Goose 1909 on December 2nd.</p>
<p id="p-159">And Silly Goose said, wish I could give it 10 stars.</p>
<p id="p-160">Aw.</p>
<p id="p-161">Amazing.</p>
<p id="p-162">Thank you.</p>
<p id="p-163">Amazing.</p>
<p id="p-164">Thank you, Silly Goose.</p>
<p id="p-165">I love the name.</p>
<p id="p-166">It's fantastic.</p>
<p id="p-167">So if you love the show, let us know what you think, guys.</p>
<p id="p-168">Go on over and leave a review, leave a rating, and we will be happy to announce your name on the show.</p>
<p id="p-169">Right, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-170">Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-171">Love it.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-172">Yes, absolutely, love it.</p>
<p id="p-173">So thank you guys so much.</p>
<p id="p-174">So Lindsay, what are, let's talk about some similar sounding expressions that are pretty close in meaning.</p>
<p id="p-175">What are some?</p>
<p id="p-176">All right, so the phrase night and day.</p>
<p id="p-177">So this is used more to say that something is an opposite, right?</p>
<p id="p-178">So we could come back to this, Michelle, and I think we should.</p>
<p id="p-179">Just this one phrase, another day.</p>
<p id="p-180">But for example, I feel so much better today after the medicine, it's like night and day.</p>
<p id="p-181">So here, what are we saying?</p>
<p id="p-182">What is like night and day?</p>
<p id="p-183">How I felt yesterday versus how I felt the day before, before I took the medicine.</p>
<p id="p-184">Totally, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-185">And we could talk about, this is different.</p>
<p id="p-186">This is a little different, right?</p>
<p id="p-187">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-188">Lindsay, is living in Denver versus Boston like night and day?</p>
<p id="p-189">Yeah, I think it actually kind of is.</p>
<p id="p-190">There's a lot of sunshine here compared to Boston in my experience.</p>
<p id="p-191">And people are a little friendlier, I think.</p>
<p id="p-192">People are a little lighter and more likely to smile at you.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-193">lighter and more likely to smile at you on the street.</p>
<p id="p-194">So it does kind of feel like night and day.</p>
<p id="p-195">It's a very different lifestyle, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-196">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-197">Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-198">So, all right, here, this is another one that is, I would say, more similar to oil and water.</p>
<p id="p-199">So this is fire and ice.</p>
<p id="p-200">Ooh.</p>
<p id="p-201">Do you hear this one?</p>
<p id="p-202">I've only seen this as like a name of a restaurant, I think.</p>
<p id="p-203">That's funny.</p>
<p id="p-204">Yeah, Yeah, So this is from AI.</p>
<p id="p-205">I'm just going to, so it, AI said that it refers to two opposing forces, represents passionate extremes, I'm quoting a little bit, like intense love and bitter hatred.</p>
<p id="p-206">Ooh, yes.</p>
<p id="p-207">And it's interesting.</p>
<p id="p-208">It says that it comes from Robert Frost's poem of the title for fire and ice.</p>
<p id="p-209">So, yeah, interesting to see a little bit of where it comes from.</p>
<p id="p-210">Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-211">So fire and ice.</p>
<p id="p-212">This one, I don't hear quite as much, you know, I hear the night and day thing.</p>
<p id="p-213">I hear, you know, oil and water, but fire and ice.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-214">oil and water, but fire and ice, I guess, it kind of conveys there's going to be drama, right?</p>
<p id="p-215">There's going to be drama, there's going to be sparks, and not in a good way.</p>
<p id="p-216">Right, right, right.</p>
<p id="p-217">So the kids are like, fire and ice.</p>
<p id="p-218">I don't know how it got this bad.</p>
<p id="p-219">For sure.</p>
<p id="p-220">Yeah, Michelle, what else here?</p>
<p id="p-221">Yeah, I mean, what do you think?</p>
<p id="p-222">Like, do you think you could use any of these in a professional context?</p>
<p id="p-223">Would you say the more casual?</p>
<p id="p-224">What do you think?</p>
<p id="p-225">Yeah, I mean, I think that definitely this could work in both ways.</p>
<p id="p-226">I would be careful when you're talking about people in general.</p>
<p id="p-227">We've talked about this before in business, your career, be careful anytime you're talking about someone's personality and how it might clash with someone else's personality.</p>
<p id="p-228">That's another bonus there, by the way, Michelle, clash.</p>
<p id="p-229">Yes, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna put that word.</p>
<p id="p-230">So guys, remember to get that app.</p>
<p id="p-231">Yeah, because that's gonna be one of the bonus words for today.</p>
<p id="p-232">Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-233">So I think you could use it at work.</p>
<p id="p-234">Just be careful when you're having these conversations.</p>
<p id="p-235">Who's around?</p>
<p id="p-236">I would say just talk about other things.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-237">say just talk about other things, not so much people's personalities, you know.</p>
<p id="p-238">That's what I would do.</p>
<p id="p-239">Right, Yeah, Yeah, Good.</p>
<p id="p-240">So let's do a role play and see how we could use it.</p>
<p id="p-241">Okay, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-242">So here we are friends.</p>
<p id="p-243">We're talking about our childhood.</p>
<p id="p-244">All right.</p>
<p id="p-245">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-246">So did you get along with your siblings when you were young?</p>
<p id="p-247">Oh, no way.</p>
<p id="p-248">We were like fire and ice.</p>
<p id="p-249">But actually, from then until now, it's like night and day.</p>
<p id="p-250">We're super close.</p>
<p id="p-251">Oh, that's good.</p>
<p id="p-252">What about you?</p>
<p id="p-253">My siblings are kind of like oil and water.</p>
<p id="p-254">I wish we got along better, but we're just too different.</p>
<p id="p-255">That's too bad.</p>
<p id="p-256">Yeah, Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-257">Oh, that would be kind of a cool survey for our listeners for today to see if our listeners are close to their siblings or not.</p>
<p id="p-258">Yes, That will be our Spotify poll today.</p>
<p id="p-259">So make sure you participate in our poll by going over to Spotify and voting in the poll.</p>
<p id="p-260">Good stuff.</p>
<p id="p-261">So I asked you, did you get along with your siblings when you were young?</p>
<p id="p-262">And you said, no way.</p>
<p id="p-263">No, I said we were like fire and ice.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-264">No, I said we were like fire and ice.</p>
<p id="p-265">But then I said, but actually from then until now is like night and day.</p>
<p id="p-266">So that's a little bit different.</p>
<p id="p-267">So basically that's saying it's totally different.</p>
<p id="p-268">Yeah, Now we're super close.</p>
<p id="p-269">Yeah, I really like the expression night and day because it just, it just shows real contrast.</p>
<p id="p-270">Something has changed, right?</p>
<p id="p-271">And I would encourage our listeners to try that one out today.</p>
<p id="p-272">Yeah, All right, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-273">So is there another episode that our listeners could check out?</p>
<p id="p-274">Yes, Guys, check out episode 2332 was, do you say, I don't know too much.</p>
<p id="p-275">That was a fun one.</p>
<p id="p-276">I remember we did.</p>
<p id="p-277">Yeah, I love that one.</p>
<p id="p-278">Guys, go on over and while you're at it and make sure you hit follow on the All Ears English podcast.</p>
<p id="p-279">Now, Michelle, what is our final idea today?</p>
<p id="p-280">Final thought for the day?</p>
<p id="p-281">Well, this, I mean, it's kind of an unfortunate topic to talk about somebody who is like oil and water, but it's important.</p>
<p id="p-282">And we gave you the reasons why.</p>
<p id="p-283">And we gave you two other ways to.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-284">we give you two other ways to express this idea of opposites.</p>
<p id="p-285">They're not necessarily exactly matches.</p>
<p id="p-286">And I want to do a whole follow-up on night and day because I think that's a really, really useful one.</p>
<p id="p-287">But give these a try and we hope you're not like oil and water with anyone today.</p>
<p id="p-288">I know for sure.</p>
<p id="p-289">And I'm excited to come back to that night and day.</p>
<p id="p-290">So hit follow on the podcast.</p>
<p id="p-291">And Michelle, I will see you another day.</p>
<p id="p-292">All right.</p>
<p id="p-293">All right.</p>
