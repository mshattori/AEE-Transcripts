<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>Michelle, how are you feeling today? We are about three weeks, two and a half or three weeks out from the election.</p>
<p>How are you feeling? Yes, I, yeah, it's interesting.</p>
<p>It's an interesting time.</p>
<p>I really, do you feel like it's going to be close? Do you feel like, do you have an inkling that somebody is definitely going to win? Like, how do you feel? I think it's going to be really close.</p>
<p>It's going to be really close from what I'm seeing right now.</p>
<p>And that's why we're here to talk about this, to give our listeners the tools and the skills in this series that we're going into this month.</p>
<p>Michelle, what do you think is the main issue, the most important issue that will essentially decide this election? Well, I think there's many, and we're going to touch on them today.</p>
<p>I would say the, I would say the main issue is the economy.</p>
<p>It's the economy, stupid, right? We've talked about that before.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>right? We've talked about that before.</p>
<p>It's, you know, people do vote on it.</p>
<p>We think that I think politicians a lot of times might think that they, you know, people care about so many different issues and they do and they do, but people do have their priorities.</p>
<p>And I think that a lot of times what people can afford, what if they can feed their families, I think that is always going to be really the main thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is what they call on CNN, the kitchen table issues, right? Yeah.</p>
<p>How much does it cost to send my kid to daycare, buy a batch of eggs, you know, what was my wage last year? Is it paying for my rent? That sort of thing is, I do, I agree with you, Michelle, the economy will decide.</p>
<p>So we're going to talk about the economy and how people feel about it and where this might come up for our listeners in conversations.</p>
<p>But this is number three in a four part series.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yes, So we guys.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>So we, guys, this is an election year and we want you to be able to talk about it, to understand it, what's going on and hear from us and be prepared for these conversations.</p>
<p>So you and Aubrey have done two episodes already.</p>
<p>So the first one was episode 2284, just a few episodes ago, and that was Democrat versus Republican, how to talk about American politics.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And in that episode, we really laid the groundwork for you.</p>
<p>We talked about what is a Democrat, what's a Republican, what's left, what's right, how, you know, what is, you know, the popular vote, what's the electoral vote.</p>
<p>Those are the fault lines.</p>
<p>Those are the basic divisions that we need to know to move into this series.</p>
<p>And then in 321, over on Business English, we talked about, should you discuss politics at work, right? So that was called, who are you voting for, four questions, sorry, questions to avoid at work.</p>
<p>So go into that because our answer was actually pretty nuanced.</p>
<p>It wasn't.</p>
<p>Don't talk about it because that would be no episode.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>Don't talk about it because that would be no episode.</p>
<p>There would be no episode.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Goodbye.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It was actually pretty interesting the way we showed you how you can actually bring up the topic, allowing a lot of white space, allowing a lot of pivoting away from it, and being very broad.</p>
<p>It's like a dance.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's a dance.</p>
<p>What's okay? Okay.</p>
<p>This feels right.</p>
<p>This feels too much.</p>
<p>Who am I talking to? Lots there.</p>
<p>So listen to that episode.</p>
<p>Again, that was Business English Episode 321.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>And the next episode in this series, after today's episode, will be right here on All Ears English, guys.</p>
<p>So hit the follow button now.</p>
<p>These are skills you're going to need in the next two weeks to have those conversations.</p>
<p>You may be invited to an election watch party.</p>
<p>Those are pretty common.</p>
<p>You may be working at a polling place.</p>
<p>Who knows? Maybe you're helping.</p>
<p>And you'll need to have these conversations, okay? This is how we connect over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>So Michelle, shall we get into it? All right.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, guys, as we said, we're going to be talking about some of the main hot-button issues, right? Those are really the key issues that people are going to be considering when they are deciding whether to vote for Kamala Harris or Donald Trump, okay? Yeah.</p>
<p>So, these issues are extremely complex, so we're not going to – we're really going to dive into a couple of them, and we're going to touch on some of them.</p>
<p>We've touched on them a little bit in that first episode, so remember to go listen to that.</p>
<p>But we're going to give you the main idea so you have an understanding when you hear about them on the news or conversations or wherever you may be hearing about it because it's everywhere now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>These are the big divisive issues where people lock horns.</p>
<p>We define the term lock horns on All Earth's English last week with Aubrey.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We lock horns.</p>
<p>We dig in.</p>
<p>It becomes a personality cult.</p>
<p>Our perspective on these issues, except for maybe the economy, although I think the way we interpret the economy has also become –</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>reinterpret the economy has also become kind of a personality cult in a way, right? Like two sides.</p>
<p>Yes, Oh, it's very much, it feels like a football game.</p>
<p>It feels like everybody's on their team and really can't see to the other side at all.</p>
<p>It's crazy.</p>
<p>Things have gotten pretty intense.</p>
<p>So the first big issue, Michelle, is reproductive rights.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And we did hint at this in the first episode in this series, Aubrey and I did, but today we're going to go a little bit deeper.</p>
<p>Michelle, what can we tell our listeners about reproductive rights? Okay.</p>
<p>So, well, this deals with the basic idea of being pro-life versus pro-choice.</p>
<p>So pro-life is generally the Republican view, which means that you either don't believe that a woman should have the right to have an abortion at all or very little rights.</p>
<p>And pro-choice is more the Democrat, the liberal point of view with a right to choose.</p>
<p>That a woman, the choices between...</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>that a woman, the choices between a woman and her doctor rather than the government telling a woman what to do.</p>
<p>So, Lindsay, what happened in the past few years that was pretty traumatic, a big ruling by the Supreme Court? Yeah, I mean, the most important, we have to start with what happened originally.</p>
<p>So January 22nd, 1973 is when Roe v.</p>
<p>Wade was passed and that put national protections for abortion, for then the states were not able to make it illegal, essentially is what it was, is the government allowed abortion across the entire country.</p>
<p>That made it a national law, okay? And then- Constitutional right, right, you know? Constitutional right, and it's interesting talking about a constitutional right because the Second Amendment is also a constitutional right, which people are so sure we can't change.</p>
<p>So anyway, side point, we're gonna try in these episodes not to be too- I know.</p>
<p>Bias, but-</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>I know bias, but um, but we're trying to lay the groundwork and show you guys what the big issues are.</p>
<p>So what happened more recently, Michelle, I'll, I'll put that over to you.</p>
<p>So we had Roe v.</p>
<p>Wade was passed in 73.</p>
<p>So we had many, many years of national abortion, right? For everyone in the US.</p>
<p>And then what happened just in 2022? Right, Well, so it was overturned by the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>And that was one of the big things that Donald Trump originally ran on that he was going to try and get Supreme Court members who perhaps would be voting in favor of overturning Roe v.</p>
<p>Wade.</p>
<p>And so there was a big controversy about that.</p>
<p>And now basically the states decide, and that can be, you know, when Donald Trump talks about it, he talks about, you know, saying, oh, that's a good thing, right? We just put it to the states.</p>
<p>So that's his opinion.</p>
<p>Um, but on the other end.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>Um, but on the other end, there are women who live in certain states, um, who may need those services who want to choose, um, and they can't, and it can put them in a lot of danger actually.</p>
<p>Right, So what's happening as a result is that, uh, the wait to get an abortion in states where it is still legal, like my state, Colorado is becoming longer for everyone.</p>
<p>People are having to travel across state borders.</p>
<p>I think when he said that in the debate, it's really a call out to true Republicans who, who do believe in kind of this federalist idea of states rights.</p>
<p>I think that was truly an effort to get, um, very like older school Republicans on his side.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah.</p>
<p>So that is a hot, hot issue and I don't know, we'll see what happens in the next few years around this, but especially when it happened, it was just a white hot issue and it still is.</p>
<p>I just, I just, I find it hard to think anyone is going to vote only on this.</p>
<p>There will be people that will, but I.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>people that will, but I still kind of feel the economy for most people is going to take precedent in who they vote for personally.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I do think, however, that I agree with you, but I and a lot of people who I talk to, that seems to be pretty much the number one issue, the economy or reproductive rights.</p>
<p>I feel some people, I've also heard the other viewpoint as saying, oh, people think, oh, well, if you're a woman, you have to vote Democrat because of reproductive rights.</p>
<p>But I have also heard people say that, oh, that's kind of offensive.</p>
<p>Like why should you think that a woman should vote a certain way? Right, And so it's just interesting.</p>
<p>And guys, we're talking about, like we said, we're trying not to show certain bias today.</p>
<p>So we are going to talk about a couple opinions from each of the sides.</p>
<p>And that's OK, Yeah.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Well, Michelle, let's move in.</p>
<p>So that is a white hot issue.</p>
<p>So if you do.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>is a white hot issue.</p>
<p>So if you do wade into that issue or approach that issue, be careful.</p>
<p>Don't assume you know what people believe on that issue and use qualifying language so you can back out or pivot away from very quickly.</p>
<p>You know, go into something more boring like the Fed rate cuts, which we'll talk about in just a minute if you realize you've touched the news.</p>
<p>Michelle, what about gun control? All right.</p>
<p>This is another big one.</p>
<p>So the U.S.</p>
<p>has become infamous.</p>
<p>I mean, guys, I have a feeling that, you know, a lot of times people from other countries might think of the U.S.</p>
<p>when they think of guns, right? We're kind of the gun country.</p>
<p>And we've been infamous for the amount of shootings that go on, especially school shootings.</p>
<p>So generally what it is is that those on the left, the Democrats, usually they feel that there should be stricter gun control, more intense background checks, no assault weapons.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>checks, no assault weapons.</p>
<p>And guys, we're speaking very broad terms, right? So, while the right, the Republicans, they very much believe in like what Lindsay already touched on the second amendment, which is the right to bear arms.</p>
<p>The right to bear arms.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so they feel that, you know, responsible gun owners shouldn't be punished.</p>
<p>And they always kind of resort to talking about mental health and things like that.</p>
<p>Right, Right, Mental health is kind of this, it's the, it's the response.</p>
<p>When, you know, people's, after every school shooting, and unfortunately we have many of them every year, there's always a conversation that opens around, are we going to get stricter on at least assault weapons, ban assault weapons? I think there was one and then it got removed.</p>
<p>And then the way that the right will respond to that is often around, you know, mental health.</p>
<p>It's a mental health issue.</p>
<p>It's not a gun issue.</p>
<p>And they say guns don't kill people.</p>
<p>People kill people.</p>
<p>Right, Right, It's really interesting.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>people, right? It's really interesting because I live here in Colorado and my partner grew up at the next school over from Columbine and Columbine was their 9-11 in a way.</p>
<p>It's not the same and it didn't have the same global effect, I understand that.</p>
<p>But when you're out here, you're not on the East Coast.</p>
<p>It's just not the same world and for them, that was what shook their world as high schoolers that could have been going to that school, you know? Yeah.</p>
<p>It's- Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>And so, I don't know.</p>
<p>This is another one where I have a hard time thinking people would just vote on this issue, but it's so incredibly important.</p>
<p>We never owned guns growing up in the house.</p>
<p>That was unthinkable for me, but I know a lot of people who did have guns growing up in their house and that was normal for them.</p>
<p>And we're not talking about assault weapons necessarily, maybe handguns in the house for self-protection.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>Maybe handguns in the house for self-protection.</p>
<p>But to me, to even think about that, that's unthinkable.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Right, And what's interesting, though, is that recently, I think in the debate, Kamala Harris was talking about how, so the Republicans, they kind of used a scare tactic that they say there's going to be a gun buyback, or the Democrats are going to take away your guns.</p>
<p>And it's kind of used as a way to say, no, don't vote, because they're going to take your guns.</p>
<p>But in the debate, I believe Kamala Harris said, I'm a gun owner.</p>
<p>Tim Walz, that's the vice president.</p>
<p>No, that actually surprised me a little bit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it's interesting, because I think that they are trying to say, no, we're not trying to do that.</p>
<p>We're just trying to put in protections in other ways.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's table stakes.</p>
<p>And the Republicans have a hard time believing that.</p>
<p>But it's table stakes.</p>
<p>I mean, this is what, when you're trying to run for the presidency of the United States, you have to move.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>States, you have to move to the more moderate side.</p>
<p>You can't hang out in the far left.</p>
<p>There's just no way to get elected.</p>
<p>Right, And so you have to make some concessions.</p>
<p>And by saying you're a gun owner, maybe she is a gun owner.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Maybe she probably is.</p>
<p>Right, So that's a that's a gesture to kind of bring in moderates.</p>
<p>Right, That feel the liberals have.</p>
<p>Honestly, they've gone really far to the left in 2020.</p>
<p>They went to, I think, too far to the left.</p>
<p>And now they're trying to kind of walk back a little so that they can now, you know, be able to take the country.</p>
<p>And we'll see what's going to happen at this point.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That's why that's where people I think there's a lot of difficulties when election time, because on each side.</p>
<p>Well, I feel less Trump is.</p>
<p>But like, he'll he'll deny things about things like Project 2025.</p>
<p>And she'll say, oh, that she's pro fracking.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p>pro fracking.</p>
<p>And, you know, and like you said, everybody's trying to make it seem like they're not that extreme, extreme.</p>
<p>And then I think sometimes the voters don't know what to actually trust.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>They think you're saying this in the debate.</p>
<p>That sounds good.</p>
<p>But we've seen your positions in the past.</p>
<p>We see who you associate with.</p>
<p>I'm talking about each candidate.</p>
<p>And so who am I actually electing? That's true about each candidate.</p>
<p>Yeah, totally.</p>
<p>A hundred percent.</p>
<p>So people, that's why some people get, I think that's why some people get frustrated with politics in general, because it's hard to know what to actually believe.</p>
<p>Right, I mean, and as you were saying that I was thinking about the left, but it applies on the right too.</p>
<p>There's a document floating around out there called project 2025, which is supposed to be a very, like a document outlining the Republican plans to bring things back a hundred years.</p>
<p>I haven't read it.</p>
<p>I don't know, but that's the way the Democrats are kind of framing it.</p>
<p>And so who you associate with, okay, you're going to be elected, but then who is going to be writing the law?</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p>then who is going to be writing the law, like who's going to be pushing the agenda and what is the agenda actually going to look like, right? Right, so Trump says that, you know, oh, he doesn't know it, but then all the people he associates with, and then on Kamala's side, you know, she's changed some opinions or she's, as they say, one of the keywords is flip-flop, right? And everybody does that and you never know, are they doing it just to gain votes or is this what they really think? That becomes the tricky part.</p>
<p>Yeah, she's way moderated her positions, or we think so, because so far from what we've seen, now we're recording this about a month ahead, but we haven't seen a ton of details on how the programs are going to get enacted.</p>
<p>I think people are waiting for those details.</p>
<p>They still want more details of how are we going to get this done, the different ideas that she has.</p>
<p>But Michelle, I think we should go into the major issue, which is the economy.</p>
<p>This is the one that's going to decide the election.</p>
<p>Let's take a quick break.</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p>Let's take a quick break, and we'll come back and get to it.</p>
<p>Warm up for it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Quick break.</p>
<p>All right, Michelle, let's get into the economy because this is the one that's going to decide the election.</p>
<p>I honestly, if something big happens in the week or two before the election in terms of the economy, that could decide it.</p>
<p>That's the thing is, you know, we, there's always something that comes out.</p>
<p>What do they call it? The October surprise.</p>
<p>Surprise.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There's always something that could happen that could just, you know, things are looking one way and then everything changes.</p>
<p>So it's crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the big issue with the economy is that people are angry.</p>
<p>I think people on both sides are angry.</p>
<p>They just kind of manifest it maybe in different ways.</p>
<p>And we looked up a little bit of data.</p>
<p>This data looks pretty accurate to us.</p>
<p>You can gut check this with your own research, guys.</p>
<p>But we looked at the inflation and, you know, what happened with inflation.</p>
<p>Inflation has been a global issue.</p>
<p>So everyone listening to this is probably also.</p>
<h2>Part-21</h2>
<p>Everyone listening to this is probably also experiencing inflation in their own countries.</p>
<p>It's not just the US.</p>
<p>We know that.</p>
<p>But we saw rates of inflation spike up to, we believe, around 7% in 2021, hovering around 6, 7% in 2022, down to 3.4 in 2023.</p>
<p>It's still coming down.</p>
<p>The Fed target rate, I believe, is around 2%, I want to say.</p>
<p>And so we did do some stimulus bills.</p>
<p>And I know Trump did some stimulus bills because they were trying to, I think they may have over-corrected a little bit from what happened in 2008.</p>
<p>Because what happened in 2008, Michelle, I mean.</p>
<p>The big problem.</p>
<p>Well, that's when I was graduating around then.</p>
<p>So yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So global recession.</p>
<p>But what actually happened is that we under-corrected.</p>
<p>We didn't do, I think some people say, we didn't do enough stimulus.</p>
<p>And so it was a very slow recovery.</p>
<p>I mean, we were still recovering in like 2013.</p>
<h2>Part-22</h2>
<p>were still recovering in like 2013, 14.</p>
<p>Right, Right, And they didn't want that to happen.</p>
<p>So what happened this time, Trump did two stimuli bills, I believe.</p>
<p>And then Joe Biden, when he came into office, he did another one.</p>
<p>And I think that some people think that that might have been part of what stimulated inflation, but there's also global supply chain issues.</p>
<p>I mean, Michelle, what do you think here? Yeah, I think also, then they talk about COVID and what was happening and the money that was given out.</p>
<p>You know, that stimulus.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, right.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So, so yeah, that that wasn't the right thing to do.</p>
<p>And yeah, so I agree.</p>
<p>That's like some of the major things that are going on.</p>
<p>But I mean, I mean, I have a question for you.</p>
<p>Do you sometimes it's hard to know what to believe sometimes and people have to think with their own pocketbook.</p>
<p>And sometimes, you know, Trump will say, Oh, the economy is terrible.</p>
<p>And Biden will say, Oh, the economy is good.</p>
<p>And it's people like they'll point to certain</p>
<h2>Part-23</h2>
<p>like they'll point to certain statistics but then people say okay but it's not necessarily yeah whatever may be true it's possible like one side or the other is correct however like it's what people feel and that actually makes the difference so like whether or not prices are higher or lower and the actual stats say there is always a sense of what is somebody experiencing daily and yes well here's the graph even so but it but I mean we like we can of course and that's what we should do those are the facts yeah but there's also just this sense of people don't necessarily vote on that they vote on what they see in their daily lives yeah there's a real this is the crux of the problem there's a real divide now between how the economy actually is in many ways it's strong yeah but it's strong for certain people in the society the stock market's pretty strong for the most part it's been on a tear since 2019</p>
<h2>Part-24</h2>
<p>2019.</p>
<p>And if you have money in the stock market, but a lot of people don't necessarily have money in the stock market.</p>
<p>So it's really good for some people.</p>
<p>And other people in society are feeling that it's awful.</p>
<p>It's the worst it's ever been.</p>
<p>And that's the crux.</p>
<p>You're looking at the same stats, the same numbers, but people are experiencing different aspects of the economy.</p>
<p>There's a different story, yes.</p>
<p>There's more behind just the numbers and the chart, right? There's a whole story of what's going on and that's where the divide is.</p>
<p>And you know, I remember in the debate, I think Trump was saying the economy was great under him and then it was terrible.</p>
<p>And then Kamala Harris would say something like, well, we had to clean up your mess.</p>
<p>And it's always like, oh, what were we left with? And what are we cleaning up? And what are we doing? It's just like a lot.</p>
<p>Especially with the economy.</p>
<p>I do feel that that is one of the more complex issues in terms of just understanding it.</p>
<p>And because, like we said, you know, you can look at, OK, what was the inflation?</p>
<h2>Part-25</h2>
<p>at, okay, what is the inflation rate, but it's just one of these, I don't know.</p>
<p>To me, it's one of the more complex things that the people aren't as interested in the actual numbers.</p>
<p>Right, And I mean, the truth is, so the truth is the president of the United States doesn't, I mean, they do have control, but they don't have a ton of control over, it's kind of misleading to say they don't have control over the economy.</p>
<p>They don't have control over the Fed and it should be that way because it's an independent Fed that sets the interest rate, which essentially that is who decides, is there going to be a higher interest rate? Therefore, could we move into a recession or do we want to get close to a recession, but not go into one? Now the Fed is projected to potentially lower interest rates this week, which would signal they think we're going for that, you know, that soft landing.</p>
<p>We'll see how soft it is.</p>
<p>So the president doesn't have control over everything and he or she shouldn't.</p>
<h2>Part-26</h2>
<p>anything.</p>
<p>And he or she shouldn't, I think.</p>
<p>I mean, that'd be insane.</p>
<p>I don't think so.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>So, I think there's always conflicting information.</p>
<p>And yeah, we're just going to have to see how it plays out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, I think the economy is going to be a big one.</p>
<p>We don't really have a ton of time, Michelle, to go into immigration, but it's another hot button issue.</p>
<p>Maybe if you guys enjoyed this series, we can do a bonus episode on immigration.</p>
<p>It's too complex to go into it now to give it the space it deserves.</p>
<p>Michelle, should we do a quick little role play so our listeners can see themselves opening a conversation on these issues? Right, And just before we do the role play, I just want to list out a couple of the other issues that will probably make a difference in the election.</p>
<p>So, immigration, but then I was also thinking foreign affairs is big, healthcare, and then the environment.</p>
<p>So, just if you're thinking about like, okay, what are some of the main issues, I would say that that's...</p>
<h2>Part-27</h2>
<p>are some of the main issues? I would say that that's, am I leaving any of the big ones out would you say? No, I'm glad you included healthcare.</p>
<p>Healthcare is definitely one of those kitchen table issues like I said before.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the environment's a big one too.</p>
<p>Those are, yeah, those are the biggies.</p>
<p>I mean, the war in Ukraine, also a biggie.</p>
<p>But I think those are broadly the big issues that we're going to be discussing with people in our communities.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So now let's do our role play.</p>
<p>So there's a lot.</p>
<p>We could keep talking and talking.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>We are friends in this role play talking about the election.</p>
<p>All right, here we go.</p>
<p>I just think the economy is going to be the biggest deciding factor in this election.</p>
<p>Groceries have never been more expensive.</p>
<p>That's true, but I actually think immigration will be bigger.</p>
<p>The two parties just completely disagree on undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>You know what? I think women will have a huge role to play in this election, especially with everything that's gone on with reproductive rights and Roe v.</p>
<p>Wade.</p>
<h2>Part-28</h2>
<p>rights and Roe v.</p>
<p>Wade.</p>
<p>That's a good point, and gun control of course.</p>
<p>Yes, so this would be like an intro conversation that our listeners could have with someone to see where do people light up and what are the issues they want to go into more, you know? Interesting, yeah, because you might, this is kind of like broaching the subject, like we're just kind of throwing everything out here and then we're gonna see, okay, is there one topic that that person, like you said, lights up about? Are we gonna realize, oh my gosh, and then you realize you get an old conversation about gun control.</p>
<p>Exactly, and Aubrey and I address this a little bit in the business space.</p>
<p>There are certain cues that you can look for.</p>
<p>Do they speak louder? Do they gesticulate more with their hands, right, when the certain issues come up? So this is how we might know what to talk about.</p>
<p>So this is good, Michelle.</p>
<p>So we went through, I said, I just think the economy is going to be the biggest deciding factor, and then I mentioned groceries, and that is the cost of food going to the grocery store.</p>
<h2>Part-29</h2>
<p>the cost of food going to the grocery store, right? And then I said, I actually think immigration will be bigger.</p>
<p>And then I said, the two parties just completely disagree on undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>Yep, exactly.</p>
<p>And then I said, I think women will have a huge role to play on everything going on with reproductive rights and Roe v.</p>
<p>Wade.</p>
<p>Yeah, usually people don't say Roe versus Wade.</p>
<p>They say Roe v.</p>
<p>Wade.</p>
<p>Yes, Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I said, that's a good point.</p>
<p>And gun control, of course.</p>
<p>So we're just kind of listing it all out.</p>
<p>We're putting everything on the table.</p>
<p>And then we're going to, it's like we're putting the buffet out and then we're going to go pick out which one do you want? Yes, Good stuff.</p>
<p>So we're moving further this into this series, this conversation around politics, politics at work on the other, on the other podcast.</p>
<p>Guys, if you have follow-up questions, be sure to let us know.</p>
<p>What's the takeaway today, Michelle? Well, so there are so many issues that we've listed that people are considering when they decide who to.</p>
<h2>Part-30</h2>
<p>that people are considering when they decide who to vote for in this election.</p>
<p>But we gave you some of the main ones today, I think a pretty comprehensive list, and we went through especially we really touched a lot on the economy here.</p>
<p>But I think the takeaway is it's tough and politics is a dirty game.</p>
<p>And when it's a little bit always hard to know what to believe.</p>
<p>So you got to make the best decision possible for balance out your news consumption.</p>
<p>Try to watch.</p>
<p>Oh, you do that, Michelle, you watch that news channels that are notoriously extremely left extremely right to give herself a balance.</p>
<p>Just if if anything, just a reality check of I think for me, the takeaway of that would be we're just so divided as a country.</p>
<p>Oh, it's really bad.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, we'll see what happens.</p>
<p>And then we will have one more episode in this series.</p>
<p>So make sure to hit follow to look out for that final episode.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
