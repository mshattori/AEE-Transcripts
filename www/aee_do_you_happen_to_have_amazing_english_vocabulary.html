<p>When you want to ask someone if they have done something</p>
<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p>ask someone if they have done something, but you need to make it clear that you have no expectations that they have.</p>
<p>What can you say?</p>
<p>Find out today.</p>
<p>Hello, Aubrey.</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>Well, did you happen to see that email I sent this morning?</p>
<p>Oh, I haven't yet.</p>
<p>What is it about?</p>
<p>Oh, I actually didn't send an email, but I wanted to use happen to start us out here.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>It came up recently on an episode we used happen.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>recently on an episode we used happen to, to soften a request and we promised to follow up.</p>
<p>So we're doing that today, sharing phrases that we use when we ask a favor or if something isn't urgent.</p>
<p>It's so important.</p>
<p>And this could also be over on our Business English podcast easily, right?</p>
<p>Because being a little bit softer about checking in on things could also be a very effective business skill.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>We do this in daily life and we do it at work because it is kind of rude just to say, you know, more blatantly.</p>
<p>Did you see that?</p>
<p>Did you do this?</p>
<p>There are phrases we use to be more respectful of someone's time.</p>
<p>And happen to is one of the top ones.</p>
<p>It's one of my favorites.</p>
<p>But before we get into what this means and other ways to say this, Aubrey, where should our listeners go as another better way to listen to the podcast?</p>
<p>Where can they go?</p>
<p>Yeah, the best way to listen is in our app.</p>
<p>You can get it at allearsenglish.com slash app app.</p>
<p>It's also the best way to find our archive, our older episodes.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>our archive, our older episodes.</p>
<p>You can search any number of vocabulary there to find older episodes that are hard to scroll back in a podcast player and access.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>And we also have now a new feature for those who are premium members over there.</p>
<p>We do a weekly roleplay recap where we talk about all the words that we learned of the week.</p>
<p>We put them into a brand new roleplay in one single conversation, right?</p>
<p>Yes, I love those roleplays.</p>
<p>If you're not getting them, you are missing out.</p>
<p>Trying to make it fun, this one recently, Lindsay was a cop and I had been in an accident.</p>
<p>We're like switching things up.</p>
<p>So yeah, you'll check those out.</p>
<p>For sure, for sure.</p>
<p>So go over, check it out at allersenglish.com slash app.</p>
<p>All right, A-P-P. All right, Aubrey, I think our listeners are ready to know what our first phrase is.</p>
<p>What does happen to really mean?</p>
<p>Let's go deeper into it.</p>
<p>Yeah, So this, it means did something sort of happen by chance?</p>
<p>Did you happen to do this?</p>
<p>All it's saying is-</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>to do this.</p>
<p>All it's taking away the intention of something like making it seem like I didn't you know purposefully and intentionally very seriously do so.</p>
<p>I just happened to do it.</p>
<p>So we often add it to questions to requests in order to make it seem more like not a big deal.</p>
<p>If you didn't do this, did you just happen to do it?</p>
<p>Right, Did you casually just stumble on my email?</p>
<p>Right, That's the vibe you're trying to send.</p>
<p>It's not exactly what you're saying, but it is the vibe you're trying to send.</p>
<p>It's all about the vibe.</p>
<p>This is really interesting when vocab can have such an effect on your tone on the vibe, especially like of an email.</p>
<p>They can't hear your tone of voice.</p>
<p>So we use vocabulary like this to create that tone.</p>
<p>Yes, it becomes very important to sometimes add extra vocabulary to make sure you're really clarifying.</p>
<p>Right, Any new examples here, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yeah, So the example from the episode before we said, did you happen to bring that costume I borrowed?</p>
<p>And we</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>that costume I borrowed.</p>
<p>And we immediately were like, Oh, this is interesting that we just very naturally added happened to so that if they didn't, it's no, it's not a big deal.</p>
<p>Just not urgent at all.</p>
<p>You know, and then contrasting, excuse me, contrasting that with, did you bring the costume?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Very different.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Very.</p>
<p>And then it's implied, you know, that it's accusatory if they didn't like, it's a big deal.</p>
<p>It's urgent and they would feel guilty if they forgot it.</p>
<p>So if you add this, then that takes all of that away.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I always, I never think of English as being that indirect of a language, but there are a lot of ways to be less direct.</p>
<p>And this is one of them, you know, there really are to respect the connection, the relationship, you're respecting their time, you're letting them know this is not urgent.</p>
<p>And that's a good way to build a connection.</p>
<p>Because imagine if everything that wasn't urgent, you didn't use this kind of language, that it would be hard to have a very strong connection with that person.</p>
<p>Right, We need to know priorities.</p>
<p>We need to know what</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>We need to know priorities.</p>
<p>We need to know what is the most important thing.</p>
<p>And then that thing that could happen next week or could happen this week is a did you happen to.</p>
<p>For example, did you happen to look at that proposal I sent you, right?</p>
<p>So I don't need it right now.</p>
<p>It could be next week, but I'm wondering if you already saw it.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And this is really interesting when it comes to work and business English because, yeah, this does imply it's not super urgent.</p>
<p>I don't need it by 5pm.</p>
<p>We would use different vocabulary.</p>
<p>We wouldn't use happen to if it is if I need it in an hour.</p>
<p>I'm not going to use happen to for sure.</p>
<p>And if you're a manager or something or just talking to colleagues, if you're in a leadership position, you do have to be clear when you need things.</p>
<p>Right, That's really important.</p>
<p>So things get done and you're not confusing your team.</p>
<p>So we're not always using this right.</p>
<p>That's really important.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So our second one is by chance.</p>
<p>These all have a similar meaning.</p>
<p>They're all added to, you know, decrease the urgency.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>decrease the urgency.</p>
<p>So for example, you might say, you know, by chance, did you decide whether to come on the trip or not?</p>
<p>So just adding by chance, instead of, did you decide whether to come on the trip or not?</p>
<p>I am, it's such a different tone where I like no big deal or not.</p>
<p>I don't mean to pressure you.</p>
<p>It's totally different.</p>
<p>Yeah, The vibe is very different.</p>
<p>Or do you have the platter you borrowed from me by chance?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This was, this is an important one too, because sometimes when people go to parties, they bring their food in Tupperware or on a platter, right?</p>
<p>Leave it at a house, someone's home.</p>
<p>And then if you want it back, yeah, you got to be careful how you deliver that.</p>
<p>It's tricky because it's not urgent.</p>
<p>You don't need it today.</p>
<p>Like you're hoping they'll return it eventually, but it's not so urgent that you'd be like, do you have the platter you borrowed from me?</p>
<p>I feel so accusatory.</p>
<p>So we would add, happen to, by chance, something like this to let them know.</p>
<p>It's kind of a reminder that you need them to return it.</p>
<p>No big deal if they didn't bring it right now.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>it.</p>
<p>No big deal if they didn't bring it right now.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>No big deal.</p>
<p>No big deal.</p>
<p>And number three, by any chance.</p>
<p>So which one do you use more often, Aubrey?</p>
<p>By any chance or by chance?</p>
<p>Let's read these examples and then I'll decide.</p>
<p>Let's see.</p>
<p>It could be, by any chance, could you give me a ride?</p>
<p>I think I say by chance more.</p>
<p>I think I'd say, by chance, could you give me a ride?</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>I like by chance more.</p>
<p>Read the second one and then you decide.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Did he mention me by any chance?</p>
<p>Did he mention me by chance?</p>
<p>Did he mention me?</p>
<p>I like the first one better.</p>
<p>It feels less cliche to me, but I think I use by any chance more.</p>
<p>Funny.</p>
<p>Yeah, we definitely, we hear both.</p>
<p>They are totally interchangeable.</p>
<p>Both are correct by chance or by any chance.</p>
<p>It probably is more about regional dialect, what you're used to hearing, what you're used to saying, but you guys can say both.</p>
<p>They'll both be understood.</p>
<p>Neither is incorrect.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I don't use by any chance very much.</p>
<p>I think I just use it when I really want to tread lightly, right?</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>tread lightly.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I feel like it's interesting just that one adding any is adding even more.</p>
<p>More.</p>
<p>No big deal.</p>
<p>By chance versus by any chance.</p>
<p>By any chance.</p>
<p>It's a little bit even less direct.</p>
<p>Less direct.</p>
<p>Yeah, It's stepping further back away from the person.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Right, Yes, Interesting.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Last one for today.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Yeah, This one's if not, no worries.</p>
<p>And you can totally add this to these others.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>If not, no worries.</p>
<p>It's like, oh, you know, by any chance, could you give me a ride?</p>
<p>If not, no worries.</p>
<p>It's another way to add or just to say it on its own to be like no big deal at all if it doesn't work out.</p>
<p>Yeah, So for example, could you watch my dog while I'm on vacation?</p>
<p>If not, no worries at all.</p>
<p>Yeah, So, and this is really respectful when you're asking for a favor.</p>
<p>You don't want someone to feel pressured like you're going to be upset if they don't do it because then it's, it's almost awkward if they do it and you feel like you've put them out.</p>
<p>It's interesting how language will help people.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>It's interesting how language will help people feel more respected and appreciated if they do the favor.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>It really matters.</p>
<p>Or if your car's in the shop, what would you say, Aubrey?</p>
<p>I might say, my car's in the shop.</p>
<p>Could you give me a ride to pick it up?</p>
<p>If not, no worries.</p>
<p>I could call an Uber.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>You know what I realized?</p>
<p>I actually use, any chance you could do this instead of by chance or by... I actually... There's a third option.</p>
<p>Yes, Good point.</p>
<p>We drop by and we'll just say, any chance you could give me a ride?</p>
<p>I say that a lot too.</p>
<p>That is the winner for me.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>That's the one I feel most comfortable with for some reason.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, Or you'd add it to this.</p>
<p>Any chance you could watch my dog while I'm on vacation?</p>
<p>If not, no worries.</p>
<p>I'd use that one a ton too.</p>
<p>And honestly, I think if you said that, if you said, any chance you could watch my dog while I'm on vacation?</p>
<p>You could stop there.</p>
<p>You wouldn't necessarily need... It's not bad, but you don't have to add the additional, if not, no worries.</p>
<p>You don't need two of these mechanisms.</p>
<p>Right, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, </p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>you're wanting to emphasize that it's not a problem if they don't do it, right?</p>
<p>Right, Like maybe that person has five kids, and they're busy, and they have a job, and they're all this, and maybe you're just worried about imposing on them, right?</p>
<p>So you want to do a double up on these phrases.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>All right, Aubrey, we are back.</p>
<p>What do we need to know about business English?</p>
<p>Yeah, So we're going to do a follow-up for this episode on business English with the phrase, it just so happens, and some related phrases.</p>
<p>As I went to add that one, and it was like, I feel like there are enough that we use more often in business English, that we could do a follow-up there.</p>
<p>That would be fantastic.</p>
<p>So guys, go over to your search bar right now.</p>
<p>If you're listening in Apple or Spotify, go and type in business English, and then find the show.</p>

<p>So you make sure that drops into your queue three days a week.</p>
<p>That's coming up soon, right, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>And there are great series.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>And there are great series where often we'll share how vocabulary is used in daily life and then a follow-up on business English, more how we use this at work.</p>
<p>You don't want to be missing those.</p>
<p>So be sure to hit follow on both shows.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You've got to be subscribed to both shows.</p>
<p>So here in our role play, fun, we are planning a friend's birthday party.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Yeah, Start us out.</p>
<p>All right, here we go.</p>
<p>By any chance, did you call Mariotti's to see if their party room is available?</p>
<p>If not, no worries.</p>
<p>Yes, I booked it for 7 to 9 PM on the 5th.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>And by chance, did they say if they'd have live music that night?</p>
<p>No, I didn't ask.</p>
<p>I can call and find out.</p>
<p>Oh, awesome, thanks.</p>
<p>If they happen to have someone scheduled, that'd be awesome.</p>
<p>And if not, let's find out if they'll let us hire someone.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Yeah, super native and natural.</p>
<p>And then I love adding any chance.</p>
<p>Both of these, you might have said, perfect.</p>
<p>Any chance they said they'd have live music that night?</p>
<p>Maybe even more common.</p>
<p>Yeah, the only tricky thing, though, for our listeners</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>Yeah, the only tricky thing, though, for our listeners with any chance, we need to change the grammar.</p>
<p>So, let's just compare this.</p>
<p>So, the first one, you said, by any chance did you call Mariottis, right?</p>
<p>How would you change the grammar if you just said, any chance you called, right?</p>
<p>So, instead of, by any chance did you call, we remove did and would say, any chance you called Mariottis.</p>
<p>So, then it becomes any chance and then the subject and a verb in past tense.</p>
<p>That is interesting how much the grammar changes.</p>
<p>That's super interesting.</p>
<p>So, we just want to watch out for that for our listeners, for our bonus of any chance, which we love, but we want to make sure we change the grammar.</p>
<p>And then I added on, if not, no worries at the end.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Yeah, You're letting me know, like, this is clearly pretty impromptu.</p>
<p>We didn't have, like, a plan to do all of this.</p>
<p>You're just asking me if I happened to already do it.</p>
<p>If not, no worry.</p>
<p>We could do it right now.</p>
<p>No big deal.</p>
<p>Yeah, That's really... All of these are really just saying, I didn't have the expectation that you've done this by now.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>All of them are saying it.</p>
<p>What else?</p>
<p>And then you said...</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>What else?</p>
<p>And then you said, perfect.</p>
<p>And by chance, did they say if they'd have live music?</p>
<p>And also the grammar would change here if you want to say any chance they said they'd have live music.</p>
<p>So again, it'd be subject, verb, and the past tense if you want to use that one.</p>
<p>And then I said, awesome, thanks.</p>
<p>If they happen to have someone scheduled, that'd be awesome.</p>
<p>And if not, let's find out if they'll let us hire someone.</p>
<p>So again, if they happen to.</p>
<p>We don't know if they will.</p>
<p>Maybe they will.</p>
<p>Maybe they won't. But if they do, here's what we do, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, And this is interesting because this type of context has nothing to do with whether we're trying to soften a request.</p>
<p>But we also use happen to this way, right?</p>
<p>Oh, if they happen to have someone scheduled, awesome.</p>
<p>If not, we'll do this.</p>
<p>We also use happen to that way just to talk about whether we don't know.</p>
<p>Just like you said, we don't know the likelihood.</p>
<p>So we'll throw that in.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Is there another episode our listeners could check out right now as we finish up today's episode to keep going, keep on this streak of All Ears English?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And this is the episode.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And this is the episode that inspired this when we used happen to in an example to soften a request.</p>
<p>It was episode 2338.</p>
<p>Here you go being great at English again.</p>
<p>Just such a fun expression we use.</p>
<p>Here you go being blank or doing blank.</p>
<p>So scroll up so you don't miss that one.</p>
<p>That's a really fun one.</p>
<p>But there's a real art to the tease here with this phrase, right?</p>
<p>You need to know exactly how to drop this and who you need to be around when you say it and how to do it.</p>
<p>So go check out that episode for sure.</p>
<p>But first, before you go, listeners, what is our takeaway for today, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is vital.</p>
<p>When you are asking a favor or making requests that aren't urgent, you do want to soften it so the other person doesn't feel imposed upon so that you aren't accidentally accusing them or creating an uncomfortable or awkward situation that is just not necessary.</p>
<p>It's true.</p>
<p>Our words have so much influence and sometimes just adding a simple, simple tiny phrase can change everything, right?</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>Everything right in interaction and especially if it's by email.</p>
<p>All right, we mentioned that at the top of the episode Mm-hmm where we can't have the tone from our voice.</p>
<p>So we need to create that tone with the words we use Yes, today's phrases are perfect to respect relationships and connection create the tone that you want through the words that you use Yes, I love it So guys if you love all there's English go ahead and hit the follow button go over hit follow on business English and we'll see You very soon.</p>
