<p>Do you ever have to ask native speakers to repeat just so that you can stay in the conversation and respond? Maybe the first time it's fine.</p>
<p>But how do you feel the 2nd, 3rd or fourth time? Embarrassed, ashamed if you've studied English your whole life, this shouldn't be happening anymore.</p>

<p>Hey there, Michelle.</p>
<p>What's shaking? Hey, Lindsay.</p>
<p>Not too much.</p>
<p>How are you? I'm good.</p>
<p>Do you have a question for me today? I am excited for this question.</p>
<p>I'm excited for this episode.</p>
<p>So the question is, do you know anyone who is mean mean? Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>I hope not.</p>
<p>Jeez.</p>
<p>I have known people.</p>
<p>I remember when I was in second grade, there was a teacher that had a reputation for being really mean.</p>
<p>And her name, ironically, her name was Mrs Dragons.</p>
<p>Dragon.</p>
<p>What a cool name.</p>
<p>I thought it was pretty cool.</p>
<p>But, you know, everyone was like, oh, she's a dragon, you know, and I just remember her being kind of mean.</p>
<p>So my second grade teacher.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>My second grade teacher for second grade.</p>
<p>Gosh, you know, teacher in second grade.</p>
<p>That sounds like that person was in the wrong job.</p>
<p>Right, Totally.</p>
<p>Do you know anyone who's mean? Um, I do, I know any, uh, it's funny that you said second grade because I was just thinking about that, this word is a little bit juvenile and when you hear it you do think of people who are from your childhood, maybe that were mean.</p>
<p>Like I knew some, I definitely knew something kids growing up.</p>
<p>It is a little juvenile.</p>
<p>I'm glad you brought that up.</p>
<p>Um, it's much more rare to hear an adult say that about someone or say it to someone like you're mean.</p>
<p>No, that's really something a kid is likely to say to another kid.</p>
<p>Uh, maybe a parent to a kid.</p>
<p>So I'm excited to get into this today for a listen.</p>
<p>I am too and we're talking about this because this was actually a listener question about this word and another word with a similar idea.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>With a similar idea.</p>
<p>So um we're gonna get to that in just a second.</p>
<p>But guys, if you haven't listened already, we did episode 2257 was let's bury the hatchet how to end an argument in English because maybe when you're arguing, somebody throws out the word mean for sure, for sure.</p>
<p>So guys go and check out that episode and all of our past episodes, we publish five days a week now in all English.</p>
<p>So you gotta hit that follow button to make sure you get all the episodes including the Saturday ones.</p>
<p>Today's episode is a Sassy Saturday.</p>
<p>We love that.</p>
<p>Sassy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So maybe we're going to be a little mean today.</p>
<p>Oh, I doubt it.</p>
<p>I doubt it.</p>
<p>I doubt it.</p>
<p>I doubt it.</p>
<p>I doubt it.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So this is, yeah, I, I am very excited for this question.</p>
<p>What do you think? I am because it came from youtube.</p>
<p>We love that.</p>
<p>And it's a question from at Ni Karos.</p>
<p>I'm having a hard time pronouncing that name, but</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>Hard time pronouncing that name.</p>
<p>But I'm going to read the question.</p>
<p>We love this listener.</p>
<p>The listener says, girls, I'm in love with you.</p>
<p>We're in love with you too.</p>
<p>Compliment.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Thanks for what you're doing.</p>
<p>After a boring day.</p>
<p>I take a walk every evening.</p>
<p>Always listening to your podcast.</p>
<p>We love that.</p>
<p>Thank you to this listener.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>It's for you guys that we do this show.</p>
<p>It's the reason why we exist.</p>
<p>You guys are the reason they said, could you explain the words nasty and mean? I heard them in a different context and I was a little confused.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is fun.</p>
<p>This is going to be a fun one to talk about and I love how this listener listens to it.</p>
<p>Told us about when uh I, I'm sorry, I don't know if it's a man or woman when they listen to us um on this, on this walk in the love.</p>
<p>Just love that.</p>
<p>And maybe guys because this is the Saturday episode.</p>
<p>Um We wonder maybe you guys are walking with us now.</p>
<p>Maybe you're on your way</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>Walking with us now, maybe you're on your way to brunch or maybe you're meeting a friend outside for a, in the park, whatever it is, we just hope you're having a really great weekend so far.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>I love that for sure.</p>
<p>Let us know what you're doing in your review of the show.</p>
<p>Let us know what you do.</p>
<p>When you listen to the podcast, you walk your dog ride the subway, what is it? You're that you're doing while you're listening to us.</p>
<p>So I'm excited for this question because we're, I love when we get into nuances.</p>
<p>Michelle.</p>
<p>Nuances.</p>
<p>Yeah, that can be a little bit tricky but there, it's so worth it to go into it.</p>
<p>So nasty and mean.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So these are very similar.</p>
<p>Um But to me when I think about it, I think of mean, is just generally the opposite of nice.</p>
<p>So maybe it's a little selfish or maybe a little conniving or maybe someone just said something mean that is a winning word.</p>
<p>Bonus word for today.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>Today.</p>
<p>That's conniving.</p>
<p>What does that mean? I mean, it's evil.</p>
<p>You're planning something a little bit for sure.</p>
<p>So, you might hear someone say something like, don't be mean.</p>
<p>I didn't do anything to you.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Or she was mean to me, your kid might come home and say that about her friend.</p>
<p>That's why you could see these themes.</p>
<p>Feel a little juvenile.</p>
<p>Right, The stuff that kids kind of deal with there are mean adults out there too for sure.</p>
<p>But they definitely, I think adults tend to get wrapped up in, in different things.</p>
<p>Right, If someone's mean to them, they might use different words to describe that person or they might just not be bothered, maybe curse words, curse words or they might be more specific in how they describe the person or they might not worry about it because they've developed a sense of, well, that's their problem.</p>
<p>Right, If they're me, I think now I don't.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>I think now I don't, yeah.</p>
<p>Meanness.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I don't let that stuff bother me as much as when I was a kid.</p>
<p>You know, I think kind of shrug it off.</p>
<p>If someone, if someone is like that, were you a sensitive kid, Michelle, I would imagine.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Yes, I was.</p>
<p>What about you? Yeah, I was really, I was really sensitive and there were mean kids sometimes and I remember, I would, I remember like, sometimes crying, like, if they were mean to me.</p>
<p>Right, Yeah, kids are sensitive.</p>
<p>So this is where this comes up and here's another phrase.</p>
<p>She can be mean, but deep down she's a nice person.</p>
<p>Now, go ahead.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I'm right now for some reason in my head.</p>
<p>Um, Meryl Streep and Devil Wears Prada is popping up when I'm thinking of a mean adult.</p>
<p>That might be one of my favorite movies.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I could imagine somebody using that word about her.</p>
<p>Right, So, it's not that it can't be used as a, about adults.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>About adults.</p>
<p>Um But an adult using it about adults is a little different.</p>
<p>Whereas like Lindsay about your teacher, you'd say that teacher is mean again, just this juvenile side.</p>
<p>And I think it's just that adults by that time have a broader range of vocabulary choices.</p>
<p>Like I would say Meryl Streep in that position would be manipulative or conniving.</p>
<p>Lots of other words, you have choices.</p>
<p>Kids don't really have that many choices and they may not think about those nuances quite yet.</p>
<p>So that's really interesting.</p>
<p>And I do want to say one other thing, sometimes we use the word mean to express something that's great.</p>
<p>Like I make a mean pasta sauce, right? And I think Aubrey and I did another episode on that or maybe you and I did, I think it was me actually, I don't know, I'd have to, I'd have to take a look, but you're right.</p>
<p>I'm like, yes, oh my God, you're right.</p>
<p>So, don't, don't discount that, don't forget about that.</p>
<p>There's also that meaning which is totally different.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>That meaning, which is totally different from what we're talking about today guys.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So, all right, I'm glad you brought that up.</p>
<p>So, now let's talk about nasty.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So that, to me is a little bit more extreme sounding.</p>
<p>Um, I'm sure we're both thinking of the same cultural context that happened in an election.</p>
<p>Are you thinking about? I think about just politics right now in general.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>About, about something that someone said, oh, I don't know specifically what you doing, a nasty woman? Oh, I actually don't remember that.</p>
<p>But, yeah, there's, there's been a lot of quotes that certain politicians, I mean, it feels like every day there's a, there's a really awful, there's some real awful quotes coming out from certain politicians.</p>
<p>I won't name names.</p>
<p>Um, yeah, it's a hard, it's gonna, it's gonna get worse.</p>
<p>Michelle, it's gonna be very intense this fall.</p>
<p>Um, so,</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>This fall.</p>
<p>Um So we're, we're here for it.</p>
<p>We're on board will weather the storm.</p>
<p>Um But yeah, so nasty is more extreme and it's also a little more versatile the way it could be used.</p>
<p>So we'll show our listeners about that, right? So this could refer to things, not just people.</p>
<p>So for example, something dirty could be nasty.</p>
<p>You could say this purse is nasty.</p>
<p>Let's clean that out.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm describing my own purse right now.</p>
<p>Oh, for sure.</p>
<p>I mean, the trash needs to be taken out.</p>
<p>It smells nasty.</p>
<p>You walk downstairs, someone has been cooking fish and it hasn't been taken out.</p>
<p>It smells take out that trash, right? Or you know, something disturbing or unpleasant can be nasty.</p>
<p>So you can even describe the weather as nasty.</p>
<p>So you could say bring an umbrella, it's nasty out there.</p>
<p>Oh, for sure, for sure.</p>
<p>That is a really common use actually to describe the weather nasty out there.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And here's another example about the trash.</p>
<p>Of course, you had a trash example when we walked in, there was a nasty smell.</p>
<p>Then we found that there was moldy fruit in the trash.</p>
<p>This sometimes happens or in the fridge, there's a funky smell coming from your fridge.</p>
<p>And then you figure out and then you grab like the moldy peach and then you, you look at it, it's like nasty.</p>
<p>I'm gonna throw this now.</p>
<p>That is nasty.</p>
<p>Oh, that's the worst.</p>
<p>Do you ever have it where you're, where you're walking by your sink or you're walking by something and, and you catch a whiff of a smell and, but you're, but you're thinking, did I have, where is that coming from? And you can't quite find it.</p>
<p>Well, what happened to me in Cambridge last week when I was there visiting? I, I guess Cambridge is just a little more urban than Denver and it was extremely humid last week on the east coast or two weeks ago and it was trash morning.</p>
<p>It was 8 a.m.</p>
<p>We went to move our car.</p>
<p>I hopped out onto the sidewalk and I was overwhelmed by a really nasty smell.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>By a really nasty smell of the trash on the side of the road.</p>
<p>Yeah, the trash didn't come by.</p>
<p>So anyways, this is very versatile.</p>
<p>I would say this word.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Michelle, what else do we need to know? Oh, ok.</p>
<p>Well, so I was going to bring up the political situation but there was a situation where, I mean, I can say it.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna, you know, Trump called Hillary Clinton a nasty woman.</p>
<p>Oh, I forgot about that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>She ended up taking that and putting a positive spin on it because like there were shirts that said nasty woman because nasty can also have this sense of, huh? I can't, I can't curse on the air but you know, when somebody maybe, yeah, like someone's a bad something.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like you are in charge, right? You're in charge.</p>
<p>You boss like you, you know, so, so they took that.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>So, so they took that word and they put it in kind of a positive light like that.</p>
<p>You're cool.</p>
<p>You're nasty.</p>
<p>Right, Sure.</p>
<p>That makes sense.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, this word is a little more interesting than mean, I would say because it has more edges.</p>
<p>It can be used repurposed in different ways.</p>
<p>Right, Right, Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>So, let's just break it down one more time.</p>
<p>I mean, again, mean, is generally more, I mean, nasty is a little juvenile sound too but mean, is generally more about a person or something.</p>
<p>Someone says like that's mean or she's mean, whereas nasty is a little bit more extreme but it can describe more things like when they said it's more versatile a setting something dirty.</p>
<p>Um, like, it wouldn't make sense to say, bring an umbrella.</p>
<p>It's mean out there or your purse is mean.</p>
<p>Right, It's in that sense.</p>
<p>Right, It's, it's just different, I mean, mean, does have lots of meanings though.</p>
<p>I mean, what do you</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>Though.</p>
<p>I mean, what do you mean? That's not, what do you mean the mean is an average, the mean number? So there's, there's lots of different uses of it.</p>
<p>But in terms of this, I think what the listener was getting to this meeting we've really discussed today another day, we can go into the mean, the average, the medium, the mean, the mode, all those things.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>You know, all those good things we learned in school and, but today, oh my gosh, I completely forgot about that one.</p>
<p>But today is just about mean versus nasty character traits or setting scenarios, trash cans, things like that.</p>
<p>Uh, Michelle, this is really fun.</p>
<p>But, you know, there is actually an even better place to consume this podcast.</p>
<p>I, because there's a place to actually consume it where it's ad free and we haven't talked about this too much.</p>
<p>We do sometimes have ads, commercials on this show.</p>
<p>But the place you can go to here.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>But the place you can go to here, just the show without any outside voices, outside commercials is where Michelle, where is it? Is the app, the All English app.</p>
<p>So we have this for I Os and Android.</p>
<p>Um There's tons of great things about this app.</p>
<p>You can get real time transcripts and you can listen to the app, the episodes at any speed, right? So you want to slow it down, you want to speed it up whatever you want to do, you can do it there more granular speeds.</p>
<p>We just updated the app this year because you guys were asking us for, you wanted to listen at one, let's say 0.8 0.9 you can actually do that on 1.11 0.2.</p>
<p>You can't do that as far as I know on Spotify or Apple, but you can do it over on the app.</p>
<p>We've also added a new premium bonus feed which recaps all of the vocabulary words for the week.</p>
<p>Michelle.</p>
<p>I think our listeners just need to go over and check it out.</p>
<p>You can try it for a seven day trial for free</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p>For a seven day trial for free guys.</p>
<p>Um, go over to all ears English dot com slash app.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Let's do a role play.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>We are friends at a restaurant.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Can we talk about the plan for the summer for a second? Uh, Michelle, I'm not in the mood.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Don't be beat about it.</p>
<p>Well, I'm sorry, I'm just tired.</p>
<p>I didn't mean it, it's ok.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>there's a bug in my food.</p>
<p>Oh, yuck.</p>
<p>That's nasty.</p>
<p>Let's call the waitress over.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>She's even pretty nasty with other customers.</p>
<p>Don't be scared.</p>
<p>This is gross.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Right, Yeah.</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>So we found a bug in the food.</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>So first I said, oh, Michelle, I'm not in the mood to talk about the summer plan or the plan for the summer.</p>
<p>Right, And you said, ok, don't be mean about it.</p>
<p>Maybe I snapped at you, but I was just a little</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p>You but I was just a little tired.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So then you said I'm just tired.</p>
<p>I did, sorry, I'm having trouble talking with my getting over a cold.</p>
<p>Sorry, I didn't mean it.</p>
<p>And, um, of course, that's a different meaning of me.</p>
<p>And what you're saying there is I didn't intend, I didn't intend to or something.</p>
<p>And then you said there's a bug in my food and I said, oh, yuck, that is nasty.</p>
<p>Now, this is referring to the example I said about the trash on the sidewalk in Cambridge or the fish in the garbage, right? This is that scenario.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>We all know.</p>
<p>Yes, Yes, And then I said, I, I got a little, I was a little scared of the waitress because I said she seemed pretty nasty with other customers.</p>
<p>Now, I could have said mean too there.</p>
<p>So that would have been a time where either one would be ok.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think as we, I think we did a good job kind of describing there that, yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, we've, we've driven that point home that</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p>Uh we've, we've driven that point home.</p>
<p>That mean is a little more juvenile nasty.</p>
<p>Might be a little more adult like or something or more interesting to use.</p>
<p>Have more uses.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>OK, Michelle, where should we leave our listeners? This has been kind of an interesting episode today.</p>
<p>Yeah, this was fun.</p>
<p>This was a fun question about the nuances, like Lindsay said, we love talking about these nuances on the show.</p>
<p>And so we really went over some specific ways to know the difference today.</p>
<p>Um And I think the moral of the story is we know we don't have any mean listeners and uh um we just uh know that these are two really good vocabulary words to try or to listen for.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I also want you to know guys, this is how we get to 99% fluency c two level which we're all working towards is actually asking these questions.</p>
<p>What is the difference between this word and that word and then paying attention and then starting to experiment</p>
<h2>Part-21</h2>
<p>Starting to experiment, plug them in, in different places in your conversations.</p>
<p>That's how we reach that fluency level.</p>
<p>It's time to really differentiate and expand our vocab.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>Thank you so much and yeah, guys, have a great day.</p>
<p>All right, have a good one.</p>
<p>Michelle.</p>
<p>Talk to you soon.</p>
<p>Bye bye.</p>
