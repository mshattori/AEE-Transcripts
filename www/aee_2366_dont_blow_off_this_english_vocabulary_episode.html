<p>Hello, Michelle, how are you?</p>
<p>I'm good, Aubrey, how are you?</p>
<p>It's so fun to be back here with you today, and I have a question.</p>
<p>Do you ever get a blowout?</p>
<p>Oh, only when I am going to get my hair cut, but I don't go</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>cut.</p>
<p>But I don't go.</p>
<p>I know some people, they just go.</p>
<p>They're not getting it cut or anything.</p>
<p>They're just going for a blowout.</p>
<p>I don't really do that.</p>
<p>How about you?</p>
<p>I've never done that.</p>
<p>I've never gone into one of those dry bars.</p>
<p>I see them.</p>
<p>And it's like, this is the price for a blowout.</p>
<p>I don't kind of have that kind of hair that I don't think that would really help that.</p>
<p>But curious if you guys listening, if that exists elsewhere, probably.</p>
<p>It's fairly new in the States that there are these dry bars where you would go just for like a blowout and a style.</p>
<p>So guys, a blowout, I mean, it's when somebody goes just to get their hair blow dried, but in a really nice way.</p>
<p>I mean, not just, oh, you're drying it after the shower or whatever.</p>
<p>It's a really nice way.</p>
<p>And for some people, they can get that and they don't have to wash their hair or do anything to it for a week, right?</p>
<p>I don't have that kind of hair either.</p>
<p>We got an interesting question today.</p>
<p>There are so many phrasal verbs with this verb.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>many phrasal verbs with this verb blow that we're going to dive into today.</p>
<p>Do you want to read this question for us, Michelle?</p>
<p>Yes, I would love to.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>It says, Hello, Lindsay, Michelle, Jessica, and Aubrey.</p>
<p>This is Mira again.</p>
<p>Hi, Mira.</p>
<p>I have been listening to the All Ears English podcast for more than three years.</p>
<p>I found listening to All Ears English to become part of my life when I drive, when I walk my dog, or even when I run some errands.</p>
<p>Thank you guys for all the effort, and I appreciate that.</p>
<p>Well, thank you so much, Mira, for listening.</p>
<p>I know, right?</p>
<p>I love this feedback.</p>
<p>I love your name, Mira, and I love your question and your feedback.</p>
<p>So thank you so, so much.</p>
<p>Now, here's the question.</p>
<p>It says, I have a question about the phrasal verb blow.</p>
<p>I know there are so many phrasal verbs related to blow, like blow up, blow off, blow out, and blow away.</p>
<p>Could you guys elaborate on these phrases for me sometime?</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards, Mira.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mira.</p>
<p>Yes, such a good question.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>Thank you, Mira.</p>
<p>Yes, such a good question.</p>
<p>There are so many and they all have such very different meanings.</p>
<p>Phrasal verbs can be so tricky to keep straight.</p>
<p>They're confusing when so many come from one verb like this.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>And this is one of those where there's just a ton.</p>
<p>So we are going to get into a bunch of them today.</p>
<p>Before we do, guys, we want to remind you to hit the follow button so you never miss anything from the All Ears English podcast.</p>
<p>Let us come to you.</p>
<p>You don't have to go looking for us.</p>
<p>We'll just come to you every day and say, hello, we're here.</p>
<p>Yes, we have five episodes every week.</p>
<p>That is amazing.</p>
<p>Very few podcasts do that.</p>
<p>So it's fun that we're with you so many days of the week.</p>
<p>It is fun.</p>
<p>All right, let's dive in here.</p>
<p>This first one, we talked about blowout when we're talking about hair, but it has another meaning.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can get a blowout on the highway.</p>
<p>What does that mean, Michelle?</p>
<p>You mean like when you're drying your hair?</p>
<p>When your tire</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>When your tire, I would say, doesn't have any air in it and then your car is in trouble?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Do you say this for a flat tire?</p>
<p>If you get a flat tire, we say we got a blowout.</p>
<p>That's funny.</p>
<p>I actually don't. I would say flat tire.</p>
<p>I wonder if it's a regional thing or if it's something that I don't know about cars.</p>
<p>No, I'm curious, but I remember watching A Christmas Story this winter and this is when he gets a flat tire on the highway and he says, ah, blowout.</p>
<p>And that's how I grew up saying it.</p>
<p>So at least it's me and the people in A Christmas Story.</p>
<p>But yeah, you would just say like, we had a blowout on the freeway.</p>
<p>That means we got a flat tire.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, exactly.</p>
<p>So let's do blow up.</p>
<p>So this one has some of these have even, I mean, even blowout, there are other meanings for that too.</p>
<p>But blow up, there are at least three.</p>
<p>So we're going to talk about three here today.</p>
<p>So the first one is inflate.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>And so the first one is inflate.</p>
<p>So you blow up a balloon or you blow up an air mattress.</p>
<p>Aubrey, do you feel comfortable sleeping on an air mattress?</p>
<p>It depends on the air mattress.</p>
<p>There are some newer ones that are actually quite comfortable.</p>
<p>But when they lose air overnight or camping, then no.</p>
<p>Terrible.</p>
<p>Awful.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't know.</p>
<p>I just can't. I feel like exactly what it feels like.</p>
<p>I feel like I'm sleeping on air and I can't. I don't know.</p>
<p>I can't do it.</p>
<p>It's not comfortable for me.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>So you blow up a balloon, blow up an air mattress.</p>
<p>Aubrey, what's another one?</p>
<p>One of the other meanings for blow up is to become angry or yell or overreact, maybe you could say.</p>
<p>I blew up at my boss yesterday.</p>
<p>This would mean you got really angry and probably yelled.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Not good.</p>
<p>Not a good one.</p>
<p>Not good.</p>
<p>This one is very interesting.</p>
<p>To become a popular fast.</p>
<p>Timothy Chalamet really blew up this year.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>really blew up this year.</p>
<p>So that's the actor.</p>
<p>He's in that new Bob Dylan movie.</p>
<p>Have you seen that?</p>
<p>Have you watched?</p>
<p>It's called A Complete Unknown.</p>
<p>I haven't seen it either.</p>
<p>I want to.</p>
<p>It looks good.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that was filmed near some of it was filmed very close to where I used to live.</p>
<p>They converted a bookstore into I think a record shop.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, So that was exciting for a little while.</p>
<p>Yeah, you're going to miss living where films are created sometimes and seeing the movie crews.</p>
<p>Yeah, we have that a lot.</p>
<p>So that was interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, Timothee Chalamet.</p>
<p>I always have trouble with his name.</p>
<p>This kind of blowing up this way.</p>
<p>It's like to become popular really fast and means you're hearing about them everywhere.</p>
<p>They're in the news.</p>
<p>They're in the media.</p>
<p>Everyone's talking about them.</p>
<p>That's kind of what it means to blow up.</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So now let's do blow off.</p>
<p>This one very different.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>Very different.</p>
<p>So this one is to dismiss or ignore or not prioritize.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you might say I'm surprised he didn't show up for the meeting.</p>
<p>He doesn't usually blow things off like this.</p>
<p>So yeah, it just means like you maybe didn't take it seriously.</p>
<p>You didn't show up at all.</p>
<p>I try never to blow anything off.</p>
<p>If someone thinks I did that, it was likely a mistake.</p>
<p>Right, that's the thing.</p>
<p>Sometimes you don't want somebody to think that you blew them off.</p>
<p>Really, there's probably another explanation.</p>
<p>Right, and we probably shouldn't assume this about people because likely, like you said, there's an explanation.</p>
<p>It was an accident.</p>
<p>They're going to let you know why.</p>
<p>It's so rare that someone just intentionally blows you off.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Or here's another example.</p>
<p>Is Mandy mad at me?</p>
<p>I said hi to her and she just totally blew me off.</p>
<p>Oh, Mandy.</p>
<p>Yeah, right?</p>
<p>This would be like you say hi and they just ignore you, look away, give you the cold shoulder.</p>
<p>That's me, but that's pretty rare.</p>
<p>But if they're mad at you, maybe.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>you baby?</p>
<p>Yep, exactly.</p>
<p>Or what's another one?</p>
<p>Blow away, this means impress.</p>
<p>So like you are going to blow them away with your speech.</p>
<p>And we often use this in passive voice to say like, I was blown away when I saw her dress or whatever, something that you're really impressed by.</p>
<p>Yeah, is there anything that's blown you away recently?</p>
<p>Oh, you know, I was just telling you, Michelle, about my son's speaking.</p>
<p>Yeah, because this examples, I've thought about this for my son.</p>
<p>He won a speech competition at his elementary school.</p>
<p>So now he's going to compete at the district level.</p>
<p>And if he places there, he'll go on to the state level.</p>
<p>I hope he blows them away.</p>
<p>I was definitely blown away by how hard he worked to memorize it.</p>
<p>That's great.</p>
<p>That's great.</p>
<p>That's so special.</p>
<p>So wishing him good luck.</p>
<p>And congrats to you.</p>
<p>So we have one last meaning here, blow over.</p>
<p>This means to sort of</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>This means to sort of fade away without serious consequences.</p>
<p>Often if something bad happens, you'll say like, oh, I hope that blows over, meaning like, I hope we can get past it without too many negative results.</p>
<p>Yeah, yes, exactly.</p>
<p>So I know this seems like a big deal, but it'll blow over.</p>
<p>A lot of times we might do this or say this to reassure someone.</p>
<p>Maybe, oh, if they're nervous about some sort of consequence, you might say, oh, it'll probably blow over.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>They don't show up to the meeting.</p>
<p>Someone thinks they blew them off.</p>
<p>And you say, no big deal.</p>
<p>It'll blow over, right?</p>
<p>They're all related.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>All right, let's do a role play, Michelle.</p>
<p>You and I are friends meeting for lunch in this role play.</p>
<p>I'll start us out.</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You look so cute.</p>
<p>I am blown away by your new hairstyle.</p>
<p>Did you get a blowout today?</p>
<p>Oh, thank you.</p>
<p>Yes, I did.</p>
<p>It looks amazing.</p>
<p>Hey, I'm so sorry I didn't show last week.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>Hey, I'm so sorry I didn't show last week.</p>
<p>I was surprised.</p>
<p>You don't usually blow things off like that.</p>
<p>But then I got your text about car troubles.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Ugh, I had a blowout on the highway.</p>
<p>It was awful.</p>
<p>Again?</p>
<p>That happened to you not long ago, right?</p>
<p>Yes, I have had bad luck with cars lately.</p>
<p>I need it to blow over.</p>
<p>Did you change those tires yourself or call someone?</p>
<p>I tried the first time and couldn't get the lug nuts off, so then I blew up.</p>
<p>I'm glad no one was there to see me yelling and stomping around.</p>
<p>This would totally happen to me.</p>
<p>I would try, I would get out the tool and try to get the lug nuts off, and then finally just call AAA.</p>
<p>I don't even know what a lug nut is.</p>
<p>It's those little bolts that hold the tire on.</p>
<p>I don't think, I've tried.</p>
<p>I've tried to get one off.</p>
<p>I'm like, I need to see if I could change a tire if I had to.</p>
<p>They're very stubborn.</p>
<p>It's hard to get them to move.</p>
<p>I bet.</p>
<p>I have definitely not ever changed.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>not ever change a flat tire and call it to AAA from inside the car.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, that's 100%. That's what I was thinking right away.</p>
<p>Okay, let's go through this role play.</p>
<p>I first said, I'm blown away by your new hairstyle.</p>
<p>That means very impressed.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And then I asked, did you get a blowout?</p>
<p>So I'm asking if she like went to the salon for this special blowout.</p>
<p>And then we are going to talk about you not showing up last week.</p>
<p>So I said, you don't usually blow things off like that.</p>
<p>So you don't normally ignore things, dismiss things, not go to something you're supposed to.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm usually more dependable than that, right?</p>
<p>But then you're asking about a text I had sent.</p>
<p>I had let you know I wasn't able to be there because I had a blowout, a flat tire on the highway.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And then you said, I've had bad luck with cars lately.</p>
<p>I needed to blow over.</p>
<p>So I needed to stop.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I need to get past this.</p>
<p>I need to move.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>I need to move past this.</p>
<p>Let's let this blow over.</p>
<p>And then you said, what was the last thing you said?</p>
<p>And I was talking about the lug nuts.</p>
<p>I said, I couldn't get them off.</p>
<p>So I blew up.</p>
<p>So this would be like I had like a mini temper tantrum there.</p>
<p>I got really mad.</p>
<p>At those lug nuts.</p>
<p>Yeah, right?</p>
<p>Frustrating.</p>
<p>Yes, very frustrating.</p>
<p>So speaking of jumping around and being upset, we have an episode that we want you to listen to of the Business English podcast.</p>
<p>That's episode 341.</p>
<p>Do phrasal verbs jump out at you?</p>
<p>So another good phrasal verb episode over on the Business English podcast.</p>
<p>Yes, if you're not following over there, be sure you're following both shows right here at All Ears English and Business English as well.</p>
<p>Lots of great vocab, phrasal verbs over there as well.</p>
<p>So be sure to hit follow.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So takeaway for today, Aubrey.</p>
<p>Yeah, phrasal verbs, people ask</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>Yeah, phrasal verbs.</p>
<p>People ask a lot about phrasal verbs, and there's a reason for it.</p>
<p>They're very tricky, right?</p>
<p>Because there are so many for each verb.</p>
<p>I mean, look at, we could have even gone on and on about just this one.</p>
<p>Exactly, right?</p>
<p>And they do make your speech sound so much more native and natural, because often the verb that we're changing into all of these phrasal verbs is a little more formal, a little less common.</p>
<p>So you want to learn these phrasal verbs and add them to your conversations.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, thanks for hanging out, Aubrey, today.</p>
<p>This was fun, and I've been enjoying recording with you.</p>
<p>So nice to see you again.</p>
<p>So fun.</p>
<p>I will see you next time.</p>
