<p id="p-18">I'm good, Aubrey, how are you?</p>
<p id="p-19">It's so fun to be back here with you today, and I have a question.</p>
<p id="p-20">Do you ever get a blowout?</p>
<p id="p-21">Oh, only when I am going to get my hair cut, but I don't go</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-22">cut.</p>
<p id="p-23">But I don't go.</p>
<p id="p-24">I know some people, they just go.</p>
<p id="p-25">They're not getting it cut or anything.</p>
<p id="p-26">They're just going for a blowout.</p>
<p id="p-27">I don't really do that.</p>
<p id="p-28">How about you?</p>
<p id="p-29">I've never done that.</p>
<p id="p-30">I've never gone into one of those dry bars.</p>
<p id="p-31">I see them.</p>
<p id="p-32">And it's like, this is the price for a blowout.</p>
<p id="p-33">I don't kind of have that kind of hair that I don't think that would really help that.</p>
<p id="p-34">But curious if you guys listening, if that exists elsewhere, probably.</p>
<p id="p-35">It's fairly new in the States that there are these dry bars where you would go just for like a blowout and a style.</p>
<p id="p-36">So guys, a blowout, I mean, it's when somebody goes just to get their hair blow dried, but in a really nice way.</p>
<p id="p-37">I mean, not just, oh, you're drying it after the shower or whatever.</p>
<p id="p-38">It's a really nice way.</p>
<p id="p-39">And for some people, they can get that and they don't have to wash their hair or do anything to it for a week, right?</p>
<p id="p-40">I don't have that kind of hair either.</p>
<p id="p-41">We got an interesting question today.</p>
<p id="p-42">There are so many phrasal verbs with this verb.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-43">many phrasal verbs with this verb blow that we're going to dive into today.</p>
<p id="p-44">Do you want to read this question for us, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-45">Yes, I would love to.</p>
<p id="p-46">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-47">It says, Hello, Lindsay, Michelle, Jessica, and Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-48">This is Mira again.</p>
<p id="p-49">Hi, Mira.</p>
<p id="p-50">I have been listening to the All Ears English podcast for more than three years.</p>
<p id="p-51">I found listening to All Ears English to become part of my life when I drive, when I walk my dog, or even when I run some errands.</p>
<p id="p-52">Thank you guys for all the effort, and I appreciate that.</p>
<p id="p-53">Well, thank you so much, Mira, for listening.</p>
<p id="p-54">I know, right?</p>
<p id="p-55">I love this feedback.</p>
<p id="p-56">I love your name, Mira, and I love your question and your feedback.</p>
<p id="p-57">So thank you so, so much.</p>
<p id="p-58">Now, here's the question.</p>
<p id="p-59">It says, I have a question about the phrasal verb blow.</p>
<p id="p-60">I know there are so many phrasal verbs related to blow, like blow up, blow off, blow out, and blow away.</p>
<p id="p-61">Could you guys elaborate on these phrases for me sometime?</p>
<p id="p-62">I'm looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p id="p-63">Best regards, Mira.</p>
<p id="p-64">Thank you, Mira.</p>
<p id="p-65">Yes, such a good question.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-66">Thank you, Mira.</p>
<p id="p-67">Yes, such a good question.</p>
<p id="p-68">There are so many and they all have such very different meanings.</p>
<p id="p-69">Phrasal verbs can be so tricky to keep straight.</p>
<p id="p-70">They're confusing when so many come from one verb like this.</p>
<p id="p-71">Oh, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-72">And this is one of those where there's just a ton.</p>
<p id="p-73">So we are going to get into a bunch of them today.</p>
<p id="p-74">Before we do, guys, we want to remind you to hit the follow button so you never miss anything from the All Ears English podcast.</p>
<p id="p-75">Let us come to you.</p>
<p id="p-76">You don't have to go looking for us.</p>
<p id="p-77">We'll just come to you every day and say, hello, we're here.</p>
<p id="p-78">Yes, we have five episodes every week.</p>
<p id="p-79">That is amazing.</p>
<p id="p-80">Very few podcasts do that.</p>
<p id="p-81">So it's fun that we're with you so many days of the week.</p>
<p id="p-82">It is fun.</p>
<p id="p-83">All right, let's dive in here.</p>
<p id="p-84">This first one, we talked about blowout when we're talking about hair, but it has another meaning.</p>
<p id="p-85">Unfortunately, you can get a blowout on the highway.</p>
<p id="p-86">What does that mean, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-87">You mean like when you're drying your hair?</p>
<p id="p-88">When your tire</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-89">When your tire, I would say, doesn't have any air in it and then your car is in trouble?</p>
<p id="p-90">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-91">Do you say this for a flat tire?</p>
<p id="p-92">If you get a flat tire, we say we got a blowout.</p>
<p id="p-93">That's funny.</p>
<p id="p-94">I actually don't. I would say flat tire.</p>
<p id="p-95">I wonder if it's a regional thing or if it's something that I don't know about cars.</p>
<p id="p-96">No, I'm curious, but I remember watching A Christmas Story this winter and this is when he gets a flat tire on the highway and he says, ah, blowout.</p>
<p id="p-97">And that's how I grew up saying it.</p>
<p id="p-98">So at least it's me and the people in A Christmas Story.</p>
<p id="p-99">But yeah, you would just say like, we had a blowout on the freeway.</p>
<p id="p-100">That means we got a flat tire.</p>
<p id="p-101">Yes, yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-102">So let's do blow up.</p>
<p id="p-103">So this one has some of these have even, I mean, even blowout, there are other meanings for that too.</p>
<p id="p-104">But blow up, there are at least three.</p>
<p id="p-105">So we're going to talk about three here today.</p>
<p id="p-106">So the first one is inflate.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-107">And so the first one is inflate.</p>
<p id="p-108">So you blow up a balloon or you blow up an air mattress.</p>
<p id="p-109">Aubrey, do you feel comfortable sleeping on an air mattress?</p>
<p id="p-110">It depends on the air mattress.</p>
<p id="p-111">There are some newer ones that are actually quite comfortable.</p>
<p id="p-112">But when they lose air overnight or camping, then no.</p>
<p id="p-113">Terrible.</p>
<p id="p-114">Awful.</p>
<p id="p-115">Yeah, I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-116">I just can't. I feel like exactly what it feels like.</p>
<p id="p-117">I feel like I'm sleeping on air and I can't. I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-118">I can't do it.</p>
<p id="p-119">It's not comfortable for me.</p>
<p id="p-120">Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-121">So you blow up a balloon, blow up an air mattress.</p>
<p id="p-122">Aubrey, what's another one?</p>
<p id="p-123">One of the other meanings for blow up is to become angry or yell or overreact, maybe you could say.</p>
<p id="p-124">I blew up at my boss yesterday.</p>
<p id="p-125">This would mean you got really angry and probably yelled.</p>
<p id="p-126">Oh, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-127">Not good.</p>
<p id="p-128">Not a good one.</p>
<p id="p-129">Not good.</p>
<p id="p-130">This one is very interesting.</p>
<p id="p-131">To become a popular fast.</p>
<p id="p-132">Timothy Chalamet really blew up this year.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-133">really blew up this year.</p>
<p id="p-134">So that's the actor.</p>
<p id="p-135">He's in that new Bob Dylan movie.</p>
<p id="p-136">Have you seen that?</p>
<p id="p-137">Have you watched?</p>
<p id="p-138">It's called A Complete Unknown.</p>
<p id="p-139">I haven't seen it either.</p>
<p id="p-140">I want to.</p>
<p id="p-141">It looks good.</p>
<p id="p-142">Yeah, I think that was filmed near some of it was filmed very close to where I used to live.</p>
<p id="p-143">They converted a bookstore into I think a record shop.</p>
<p id="p-144">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-145">Yeah, So that was exciting for a little while.</p>
<p id="p-146">Yeah, you're going to miss living where films are created sometimes and seeing the movie crews.</p>
<p id="p-147">Yeah, we have that a lot.</p>
<p id="p-148">So that was interesting.</p>
<p id="p-149">Yeah, Timothee Chalamet.</p>
<p id="p-150">I always have trouble with his name.</p>
<p id="p-151">This kind of blowing up this way.</p>
<p id="p-152">It's like to become popular really fast and means you're hearing about them everywhere.</p>
<p id="p-153">They're in the news.</p>
<p id="p-154">They're in the media.</p>
<p id="p-155">Everyone's talking about them.</p>
<p id="p-156">That's kind of what it means to blow up.</p>
<p id="p-157">Right, right, right.</p>
<p id="p-158">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-159">So now let's do blow off.</p>
<p id="p-160">This one very different.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-161">Very different.</p>
<p id="p-162">So this one is to dismiss or ignore or not prioritize.</p>
<p id="p-163">Yeah, so you might say I'm surprised he didn't show up for the meeting.</p>
<p id="p-164">He doesn't usually blow things off like this.</p>
<p id="p-165">So yeah, it just means like you maybe didn't take it seriously.</p>
<p id="p-166">You didn't show up at all.</p>
<p id="p-167">I try never to blow anything off.</p>
<p id="p-168">If someone thinks I did that, it was likely a mistake.</p>
<p id="p-169">Right, that's the thing.</p>
<p id="p-170">Sometimes you don't want somebody to think that you blew them off.</p>
<p id="p-171">Really, there's probably another explanation.</p>
<p id="p-172">Right, and we probably shouldn't assume this about people because likely, like you said, there's an explanation.</p>
<p id="p-173">It was an accident.</p>
<p id="p-174">They're going to let you know why.</p>
<p id="p-175">It's so rare that someone just intentionally blows you off.</p>
<p id="p-176">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-177">Or here's another example.</p>
<p id="p-178">Is Mandy mad at me?</p>
<p id="p-179">I said hi to her and she just totally blew me off.</p>
<p id="p-180">Oh, Mandy.</p>
<p id="p-181">Yeah, right?</p>
<p id="p-182">This would be like you say hi and they just ignore you, look away, give you the cold shoulder.</p>
<p id="p-183">That's me, but that's pretty rare.</p>
<p id="p-184">But if they're mad at you, maybe.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-185">you baby?</p>
<p id="p-186">Yep, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-187">Or what's another one?</p>
<p id="p-188">Blow away, this means impress.</p>
<p id="p-189">So like you are going to blow them away with your speech.</p>
<p id="p-190">And we often use this in passive voice to say like, I was blown away when I saw her dress or whatever, something that you're really impressed by.</p>
<p id="p-191">Yeah, is there anything that's blown you away recently?</p>
<p id="p-192">Oh, you know, I was just telling you, Michelle, about my son's speaking.</p>
<p id="p-193">Yeah, because this examples, I've thought about this for my son.</p>
<p id="p-194">He won a speech competition at his elementary school.</p>
<p id="p-195">So now he's going to compete at the district level.</p>
<p id="p-196">And if he places there, he'll go on to the state level.</p>
<p id="p-197">I hope he blows them away.</p>
<p id="p-198">I was definitely blown away by how hard he worked to memorize it.</p>
<p id="p-199">That's great.</p>
<p id="p-200">That's great.</p>
<p id="p-201">That's so special.</p>
<p id="p-202">So wishing him good luck.</p>
<p id="p-203">And congrats to you.</p>
<p id="p-204">So we have one last meaning here, blow over.</p>
<p id="p-205">This means to sort of</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-206">This means to sort of fade away without serious consequences.</p>
<p id="p-207">Often if something bad happens, you'll say like, oh, I hope that blows over, meaning like, I hope we can get past it without too many negative results.</p>
<p id="p-208">Yeah, yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-209">So I know this seems like a big deal, but it'll blow over.</p>
<p id="p-210">A lot of times we might do this or say this to reassure someone.</p>
<p id="p-211">Maybe, oh, if they're nervous about some sort of consequence, you might say, oh, it'll probably blow over.</p>
<p id="p-212">Right?</p>
<p id="p-213">They don't show up to the meeting.</p>
<p id="p-214">Someone thinks they blew them off.</p>
<p id="p-215">And you say, no big deal.</p>
<p id="p-216">It'll blow over, right?</p>
<p id="p-217">They're all related.</p>
<p id="p-218">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-219">All right, let's do a role play, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-220">You and I are friends meeting for lunch in this role play.</p>
<p id="p-221">I'll start us out.</p>
<p id="p-222">Ready?</p>
<p id="p-223">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-224">You look so cute.</p>
<p id="p-225">I am blown away by your new hairstyle.</p>
<p id="p-226">Did you get a blowout today?</p>
<p id="p-227">Oh, thank you.</p>
<p id="p-228">Yes, I did.</p>
<p id="p-229">It looks amazing.</p>
<p id="p-230">Hey, I'm so sorry I didn't show last week.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-231">Hey, I'm so sorry I didn't show last week.</p>
<p id="p-232">I was surprised.</p>
<p id="p-233">You don't usually blow things off like that.</p>
<p id="p-234">But then I got your text about car troubles.</p>
<p id="p-235">What happened?</p>
<p id="p-236">Ugh, I had a blowout on the highway.</p>
<p id="p-237">It was awful.</p>
<p id="p-238">Again?</p>
<p id="p-239">That happened to you not long ago, right?</p>
<p id="p-240">Yes, I have had bad luck with cars lately.</p>
<p id="p-241">I need it to blow over.</p>
<p id="p-242">Did you change those tires yourself or call someone?</p>
<p id="p-243">I tried the first time and couldn't get the lug nuts off, so then I blew up.</p>
<p id="p-244">I'm glad no one was there to see me yelling and stomping around.</p>
<p id="p-245">This would totally happen to me.</p>
<p id="p-246">I would try, I would get out the tool and try to get the lug nuts off, and then finally just call AAA.</p>
<p id="p-247">I don't even know what a lug nut is.</p>
<p id="p-248">It's those little bolts that hold the tire on.</p>
<p id="p-249">I don't think, I've tried.</p>
<p id="p-250">I've tried to get one off.</p>
<p id="p-251">I'm like, I need to see if I could change a tire if I had to.</p>
<p id="p-252">They're very stubborn.</p>
<p id="p-253">It's hard to get them to move.</p>
<p id="p-254">I bet.</p>
<p id="p-255">I have definitely not ever changed.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-256">not ever change a flat tire and call it to AAA from inside the car.</p>
<p id="p-257">Oh yeah, that's 100%. That's what I was thinking right away.</p>
<p id="p-258">Okay, let's go through this role play.</p>
<p id="p-259">I first said, I'm blown away by your new hairstyle.</p>
<p id="p-260">That means very impressed.</p>
<p id="p-261">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-262">And then I asked, did you get a blowout?</p>
<p id="p-263">So I'm asking if she like went to the salon for this special blowout.</p>
<p id="p-264">And then we are going to talk about you not showing up last week.</p>
<p id="p-265">So I said, you don't usually blow things off like that.</p>
<p id="p-266">So you don't normally ignore things, dismiss things, not go to something you're supposed to.</p>
<p id="p-267">Yeah, I'm usually more dependable than that, right?</p>
<p id="p-268">But then you're asking about a text I had sent.</p>
<p id="p-269">I had let you know I wasn't able to be there because I had a blowout, a flat tire on the highway.</p>
<p id="p-270">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-271">And then you said, I've had bad luck with cars lately.</p>
<p id="p-272">I needed to blow over.</p>
<p id="p-273">So I needed to stop.</p>
<p id="p-274">Right?</p>
<p id="p-275">I need to get past this.</p>
<p id="p-276">I need to move.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-277">I need to move past this.</p>
<p id="p-278">Let's let this blow over.</p>
<p id="p-279">And then you said, what was the last thing you said?</p>
<p id="p-280">And I was talking about the lug nuts.</p>
<p id="p-281">I said, I couldn't get them off.</p>
<p id="p-282">So I blew up.</p>
<p id="p-283">So this would be like I had like a mini temper tantrum there.</p>
<p id="p-284">I got really mad.</p>
<p id="p-285">At those lug nuts.</p>
<p id="p-286">Yeah, right?</p>
<p id="p-287">Frustrating.</p>
<p id="p-288">Yes, very frustrating.</p>
<p id="p-289">So speaking of jumping around and being upset, we have an episode that we want you to listen to of the Business English podcast.</p>
<p id="p-290">That's episode 341.</p>
<p id="p-291">Do phrasal verbs jump out at you?</p>
<p id="p-292">So another good phrasal verb episode over on the Business English podcast.</p>
<p id="p-293">Yes, if you're not following over there, be sure you're following both shows right here at All Ears English and Business English as well.</p>
<p id="p-294">Lots of great vocab, phrasal verbs over there as well.</p>
<p id="p-295">So be sure to hit follow.</p>
<p id="p-296">All right.</p>
<p id="p-297">So takeaway for today, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-298">Yeah, phrasal verbs, people ask</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-299">Yeah, phrasal verbs.</p>
<p id="p-300">People ask a lot about phrasal verbs, and there's a reason for it.</p>
<p id="p-301">They're very tricky, right?</p>
<p id="p-302">Because there are so many for each verb.</p>
<p id="p-303">I mean, look at, we could have even gone on and on about just this one.</p>
<p id="p-304">Exactly, right?</p>
<p id="p-305">And they do make your speech sound so much more native and natural, because often the verb that we're changing into all of these phrasal verbs is a little more formal, a little less common.</p>
<p id="p-306">So you want to learn these phrasal verbs and add them to your conversations.</p>
<p id="p-307">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-308">All right.</p>
<p id="p-309">Well, thanks for hanging out, Aubrey, today.</p>
<p id="p-310">This was fun, and I've been enjoying recording with you.</p>
<p id="p-311">So nice to see you again.</p>
<p id="p-312">So fun.</p>
<p id="p-313">I will see you next time.</p>
<p id="p-314">Bye, Michelle.</p>
