<h2>Part-01</h2>
<p id="p-1">This is an All Ears English podcast, episode 2346.</p>
<p id="p-2">This is tricky English grammar, though.</p>
<p id="p-3">Welcome to the All Ears English podcast downloaded more than 200 million times.</p>
<p id="p-4">Are you feeling stuck with your English?</p>

<p id="p-7">Do you hear native speakers use the word though, but you're not quite sure how to fit it in?</p>
<p id="p-8">Today, get three main ways that we use though and learn how it can add nuance to your English.</p>
<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p id="p-9">go and learn how we can add nuance and interest to what you're saying.</p>
<p id="p-10">Hey, Lindsay, how are you?</p>
<p id="p-11">Excellent, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-12">What's going on with you?</p>
<p id="p-13">What's new?</p>
<p id="p-14">Oh, not too much.</p>
<p id="p-15">It's a beautiful day here.</p>
<p id="p-16">I do have a question.</p>
<p id="p-17">We'll see if you can come up with something on the fly.</p>
<p id="p-18">I didn't prepare you for this question.</p>
<p id="p-19">Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-20">What's the last book you read?</p>
<p id="p-21">Oh, wow.</p>
<p id="p-22">So I just read a book.</p>
<p id="p-23">I just finished a book called Finding Alaska, and I loved it.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-24">Alaska and I loved it.</p>
<p id="p-25">It was hard to find the time to read though, to be honest.</p>
<p id="p-26">Oh, that's me.</p>
<p id="p-27">I wish I had time to read more.</p>
<p id="p-28">I need to like schedule it because yeah, it's me.</p>
<p id="p-29">Yeah, it's hard.</p>
<p id="p-30">It's hard.</p>
<p id="p-31">I think if you create a block of time in the day somehow and dedicate it to reading, it helps.</p>
<p id="p-32">Yes, that would definitely help, right?</p>
<p id="p-33">Well, you did something really interesting with your answer there that I want to point out.</p>
<p id="p-34">We are talking about today, you said, it was hard to find time to read though.</p>
<p id="p-35">And this is, we got a great question about this.</p>
<p id="p-36">I've gotten questions from students about this before too.</p>
<p id="p-37">Like, how do I know when can I put though at the end?</p>
<p id="p-38">I've also seen at the beginning, those kind of complicated in English.</p>
<p id="p-39">We're going to dive into this today.</p>
<p id="p-40">Yeah, I'm excited to get into a little higher level grammar here and really, because this is one of the elements that would bring us to that B2 level, C1 level to really make it work, make it smooth, have it make sense and convey our tone, our feelings, what's under the message, right?</p>
<p id="p-41">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-42">Right, Yeah, So let's</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-43">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-44">Right, Yes, So let's share the question here.</p>
<p id="p-45">This was on YouTube from Edwin.</p>
<p id="p-46">Would you like to read the question for us, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-47">Yes, Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-48">Another amazing conversation.</p>
<p id="p-49">I guess he's referring to a previous episode, right?</p>
<p id="p-50">Yes, Great.</p>
<p id="p-51">Thank you, Edwin.</p>
<p id="p-52">I was wondering if you could teach about the word though at the end of some sentences.</p>
<p id="p-53">For example, the movie was good.</p>
<p id="p-54">It was a bit too long, though.</p>
<p id="p-55">And Aubrey, there's nothing more natural than a phrase like this, right?</p>
<p id="p-56">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-57">We do this all the time.</p>
<p id="p-58">I just planned this episode a couple of days ago, but since then, it always kind of highlights for me.</p>
<p id="p-59">I start noticing and I've heard people do this several times since then.</p>
<p id="p-60">It's so common.</p>
<p id="p-61">100%. So I'm excited that we're focusing on this real English today.</p>
<p id="p-62">But guys, hit the follow button if you love Allers English and you believe in our method, our value, which is connection.</p>
<p id="p-63">Human connection is what matters and that's what we're after right here on the show.</p>
<p id="p-64">So we bring every teaching point.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-65">So we bring every teaching point on the podcast back to how you can use it to connect.</p>
<p id="p-66">Not always to be correct.</p>
<p id="p-67">We're going to show you how to be correct, of course, but we believe connection matters more.</p>
<p id="p-68">Right, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-69">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-70">And we're going to show three ways that we use though today.</p>
<p id="p-71">And the third one, especially, we really are using to build relationships and connect.</p>
<p id="p-72">So be sure to stay to the end so you don't miss that one.</p>
<p id="p-73">But we want to share, when I was looking through questions that have been sent to us, there was another one that was pretty similar, but it's more about though versus but.</p>
<p id="p-74">So I'm going to do that as a follow up.</p>
<p id="p-75">So be sure to hit follow, guys, so that you don't miss that sort of part two to this.</p>
<p id="p-76">Yeah, a bit of a mini series we've got going on here.</p>
<p id="p-77">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-78">Yeah, Where do we start today, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-79">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-80">So as an FYI, though can go at the beginning, middle or end of a sentence.</p>
<p id="p-81">So it is either being used as a conjunction to join two clauses.</p>
<p id="p-82">And when it's a conjunction, it means despite the fact that or</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-83">despite the fact that, or even though.</p>
<p id="p-84">So let's give an example sentence of it being used as a conjunction, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-85">Okay, so here we go.</p>
<p id="p-86">So, though we called in our order, it wasn't ready when we arrived.</p>
<p id="p-87">Yeah, Exactly, right?</p>
<p id="p-88">So it's at the beginning of a dependent clause.</p>
<p id="p-89">Though we called in our order, it wasn't ready when we arrived.</p>
<p id="p-90">And this is a conjunction to join two ideas.</p>
<p id="p-91">Yeah, But it can also be used as an adverb.</p>
<p id="p-92">Yeah, go ahead.</p>
<p id="p-93">Just one question about that.</p>
<p id="p-94">We could also say, although, right?</p>
<p id="p-95">Although we called in our order.</p>
<p id="p-96">Is that correct?</p>
<p id="p-97">Yes, although or even though.</p>
<p id="p-98">Or despite the fact that, right?</p>
<p id="p-99">We do have lots of options in English.</p>
<p id="p-100">So if you have said though a few times, you could use one of these other options.</p>
<p id="p-101">They all mean the same.</p>
<p id="p-102">All right, good.</p>
<p id="p-103">So let's transition into the adverb use, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-104">What does it look like?</p>
<p id="p-105">So it can also be used as an adverb.</p>
<p id="p-106">And when we use it as adverb, it means despite this.</p>
<p id="p-107">Very similar, just a different function in the sentence.</p>
<p id="p-108">So for example, he felt guilty about.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-109">So, for example, he felt guilty about lying to his mom, though he wasn't about to fess up.</p>
<p id="p-110">Yeah, he wasn't about to fess up.</p>
<p id="p-111">He may have felt guilty, but he wasn't gonna say anything about it.</p>
<p id="p-112">Yeah, and it means but, right?</p>
<p id="p-113">He felt guilty, but he wasn't gonna tell her the truth.</p>
<p id="p-114">Yeah, Exactly, you could also say but here.</p>
<p id="p-115">So, we're going to talk about three different ways we use though in English.</p>
<p id="p-116">Some of these example sentences, it's being used as a conjunction, sometimes as an adverb, and we're also going to show how we use it at the end.</p>
<p id="p-117">So, let's start.</p>
<p id="p-118">The first use is adding contrasting information.</p>
<p id="p-119">Yes, so used to add the information that contrasts with what we've already said, right?</p>
<p id="p-120">Exactly, so something has already been stated, and then we use though to contrast it in some way.</p>
<p id="p-121">Okay, so how does that look, Aubrey, when it's at the beginning of a sentence?</p>
<p id="p-122">Yeah, so at the beginning, you might say, though I know I shouldn't eat ice cream every day, I just can't resist it.</p>
<p id="p-123">So, we're contrasting what we know we should do with what.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-124">we know we should do with what we actually do.</p>
<p id="p-125">And then we can also have the option of putting it in the middle.</p>
<p id="p-126">So, here's how it looks when we put it in the middle of the sentence.</p>
<p id="p-127">They went to the same university, though they never met there.</p>
<p id="p-128">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-129">Yes, right?</p>
<p id="p-130">And then at the end, you might say, I like shopping, not when it's crowded, though.</p>
<p id="p-131">And then what's interesting is to see that all of these sentences could be reworded to put the though at the end or the beginning.</p>
<p id="p-132">It's all just about how you're constructing the sentence.</p>
<p id="p-133">So, you have lots of options.</p>
<p id="p-134">And when you throw it at the end here, I think it's the most native and natural.</p>
<p id="p-135">We do this all the time.</p>
<p id="p-136">It's a little more informal when we speak this way.</p>
<p id="p-137">And I think you do need to pay attention to intonation here too.</p>
<p id="p-138">Our listeners really want to make sure because when we say it at the end, it feels like the intonation is different, right?</p>
<p id="p-139">Not when it's crowded, though.</p>
<p id="p-140">Do you think so?</p>
<p id="p-141">We're emphasizing though a little more.</p>
<p id="p-142">So, all of these sentences, we could adjust.</p>
<p id="p-143">I could say, they went to the same university, they never met there.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-144">They went to the same university.</p>
<p id="p-145">They never met there though.</p>
<p id="p-146">And you are hitting though a little stronger to sort of emphasize the contrast.</p>
<p id="p-147">Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-148">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-149">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-150">So what's number two, Aubrey, that we need to know?</p>
<p id="p-151">Two is like you mentioned, you're replacing but or however.</p>
<p id="p-152">In this case, it's used as a subordinating conjunction.</p>
<p id="p-153">So this indicates that something you have said is less true than usual.</p>
<p id="p-154">So it's a similar, but it's a slightly different meaning.</p>
<p id="p-155">You're not just contrasting information.</p>
<p id="p-156">You're sort of saying whatever I'm saying is out of the usual is out is not normal.</p>
<p id="p-157">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-158">So for example, when we put it at the beginning, we could say, though, I don't usually buy popcorn at the movies.</p>
<p id="p-159">I'm getting some today.</p>
<p id="p-160">Yes, Yes, Or in the middle.</p>
<p id="p-161">I don't usually drink soda, though.</p>
<p id="p-162">I drink a lot today.</p>
<p id="p-163">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-164">Or at the end, I usually never skip class.</p>
<p id="p-165">I didn't go today, though.</p>
<p id="p-166">Yes, Yeah, And for all of these, I think this is what's especially</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-167">all of these, I think this is what's especially interesting.</p>
<p id="p-168">Every time you see though, it could be tacked on at the end, like our listener mentioned, right?</p>
<p id="p-169">You could say, I don't usually drink soda.</p>
<p id="p-170">I drank a lot today though.</p>
<p id="p-171">And it's really, they're very interchangeable.</p>
<p id="p-172">It's the same meaning.</p>
<p id="p-173">I would say it's the slightest bit more maybe informal, sort of casual conversational.</p>
<p id="p-174">I mean, at the end, when it's at the end.</p>
<p id="p-175">Yes, When it's at the end.</p>
<p id="p-176">I agree with that.</p>
<p id="p-177">It feels, yeah, it feels more down to earth maybe, but small difference.</p>
<p id="p-178">Very small difference.</p>
<p id="p-179">Maybe more, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-180">More spoken, spoken English.</p>
<p id="p-181">And you might just be tacking it on at the end because you're sort of thinking as you speak and you're realizing you need that though.</p>
<p id="p-182">If I say, I don't usually drink soda.</p>
<p id="p-183">And then I realized I need to admit I drink a lot today though.</p>
<p id="p-184">So then I might be adding it because I'm sort of not realizing the function here until the end.</p>
<p id="p-185">A hundred percent.</p>
<p id="p-186">I think that is what's happening actually.</p>
<p id="p-187">A lot.</p>
<p id="p-188">Yeah, You're thinking out loud and you're adding words as you're thinking how the sentence is sounding, right?</p>
<p id="p-189">How does it sound?</p>
<p id="p-190">I never skip class, but I didn't go today.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-191">get to the end and I'm like, I need to add though.</p>
<p id="p-192">I didn't go today though.</p>
<p id="p-193">Right, right.</p>
<p id="p-194">All right.</p>
<p id="p-195">The third one is to show appreciation.</p>
<p id="p-196">Tell us about this one.</p>
<p id="p-197">Yeah, we add though to thanks.</p>
<p id="p-198">It means the same as like, thank you anyway, or thanks regardless.</p>
<p id="p-199">And you are using it to indicate appreciation for an offer or a gesture that you cannot accept for some reason, or it's not needed.</p>
<p id="p-200">Hmm.</p>
<p id="p-201">Yes, I don't need a ride.</p>
<p id="p-202">Thanks, though.</p>
<p id="p-203">Yeah, So you've been offered a ride and maybe you are going to walk home, uh, or you're going to take a lift or someone's coming to get you, right?</p>
<p id="p-204">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-205">And so you could just say, no, thank you.</p>
<p id="p-206">But that actually could come off as a little bit unappreciative or like, this is a great way to show that you appreciate the offer.</p>
<p id="p-207">And we'll just be like, Oh no, thanks though.</p>
<p id="p-208">Yeah, And actually that gives me an idea.</p>
<p id="p-209">We could do another episode, Aubrey, on how to decline an offer for something.</p>
<p id="p-210">Yeah, We say lots of interesting things.</p>
<p id="p-211">We say things like, I'm good.</p>
<p id="p-212">Thanks.</p>
<p id="p-213">Right, Things like that, that are.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-214">thanks, right?</p>
<p id="p-215">Things like that that are kind of slangy.</p>
<p id="p-216">So for another day for another day.</p>
<p id="p-217">Yeah, that's definitely a good follow up because there are so many ways where we're trying to let someone know we appreciate the offer without we don't want to just say thank you or it does sound a little ungrateful.</p>
<p id="p-218">It's interesting.</p>
<p id="p-219">Yes, 100% All right.</p>
<p id="p-220">Anything else we need here before we take a quick break?</p>
<p id="p-221">Yeah, I just had that one.</p>
<p id="p-222">One more example to say if someone's offered you maybe a ride, you can say no, I'm okay.</p>
<p id="p-223">Thanks, though.</p>
<p id="p-224">That'd be another one to bring up on that whole and whole episode of ways to say that.</p>
<p id="p-225">Yeah, I think when someone does make an offer, the more words you can give the better, because that kind of softens the blow, right?</p>
<p id="p-226">No, thank you.</p>
<p id="p-227">It's a little sharp.</p>
<p id="p-228">Yeah, Okay, Aubrey, we're back for a role play.</p>
<p id="p-229">Let's see how all this comes together in a conversation here.</p>
<p id="p-230">We're meeting for lunch.</p>
<p id="p-231">Yeah, I want to start us.</p>
<p id="p-232">Yes, I thought I had been to every Thai place in town.</p>
<p id="p-233">I haven't been here, though.</p>
<p id="p-234">It's my favorite.</p>
<p id="p-235">Thai is often too spicy for me, though this curry is just right.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-236">though this curry is just right.</p>
<p id="p-237">Do you need a ride home after?</p>
<p id="p-238">I know your car was in the shop.</p>
<p id="p-239">No, I got it back today.</p>
<p id="p-240">Thanks though.</p>
<p id="p-241">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-242">Very typical conversation, right?</p>
<p id="p-243">Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-244">And we used all three and they do have such different functions.</p>
<p id="p-245">That's easy.</p>
<p id="p-246">So this first one you said, I thought I had been to every Thai place in town.</p>
<p id="p-247">I haven't been here though.</p>
<p id="p-248">And the intonation is very different.</p>
<p id="p-249">We're rising on, haven't been here though.</p>
<p id="p-250">I haven't been here though.</p>
<p id="p-251">That's that first meaning of just to really contrast what's usual with what's happening today.</p>
<p id="p-252">Yeah, You're also showing a sense of optimism in your voice.</p>
<p id="p-253">You're interested.</p>
<p id="p-254">You're excited to be somewhere new.</p>
<p id="p-255">There's a lot in there in that intonation, I think.</p>
<p id="p-256">Yeah, Let's see.</p>
<p id="p-257">And then you said, it's my favorite.</p>
<p id="p-258">Thai is often too spicy for me, though this curry is just right.</p>
<p id="p-259">And there is also a change in intonation there too.</p>
<p id="p-260">That's true, right?</p>
<p id="p-261">You have to listen to how our voices rise and fall.</p>
<p id="p-262">And this is that second use where we're saying what normally happens, normally Thai is too spicy.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-263">normally happens.</p>
<p id="p-264">Normally, Thai is too spicy for me.</p>
<p id="p-265">And then we say, though, this curry is just right.</p>
<p id="p-266">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-267">And then we finished up with a kind of, uh, not accepting an invitation.</p>
<p id="p-268">What was it, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-269">Yeah, So you had offered me a ride home thinking my car was in the shop.</p>
<p id="p-270">I said, Oh no, I got it back today.</p>
<p id="p-271">Thanks though.</p>
<p id="p-272">And this is really, it's just a great, very native, natural way to show appreciation for the offer.</p>
<p id="p-273">Yeah, Where should we leave our listeners?</p>
<p id="p-274">First of all, reminder to hit the follow button.</p>
<p id="p-275">Don't forget, don't finish the episode without doing that guys.</p>
<p id="p-276">And then what do we want to say about contrasting as far as connecting?</p>
<p id="p-277">Yeah, it is a great way to connect to contrast something because whenever something is out of the ordinary, it can create an interesting conversation.</p>
<p id="p-278">You want to highlight it, right?</p>
<p id="p-279">We have all of us kind of go through the humdrum of the day when there is a contrast, Oh, something's happening that's very different from the day to day.</p>
<p id="p-280">This is a great way to connect, to point it out.</p>
<p id="p-281">That's actually a really good point.</p>
<p id="p-282">I love that point.</p>
<p id="p-283">Aubrey, nuance, the interesting things in life are usually...</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-284">nuance.</p>
<p id="p-285">The interesting things in life are usually nuanced.</p>
<p id="p-286">Someone that never skips school but they did today, right?</p>
<p id="p-287">Someone that follows a diet but they decided to skip their diet plan today and go out of, you know, take, like, enjoy the day.</p>
<p id="p-288">These are interesting stories and moments to connect on.</p>
<p id="p-289">So show it clearly.</p>
<p id="p-290">Yes, anything out of the ordinary.</p>
<p id="p-291">We want to know why, right?</p>
<p id="p-292">We find out more about someone when we find out that they left their normal routine for some reason.</p>
<p id="p-293">Yeah, so it's a key connection skill and it's also just very natural.</p>
<p id="p-294">We use this all of the time.</p>
<p id="p-295">So I want our listeners to focus on really adopting this.</p>
<p id="p-296">Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-297">Add this to your language.</p>
<p id="p-298">Start noticing it.</p>
