<p id="p-19">Hey, Lindsay, how are you?</p>
<p id="p-20">I'm doing fantastic, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-21">How's everything in your world today?</p>
<p id="p-22">Everything's good.</p>
<p id="p-23">Lindsay, do you have any stores near you that have just everything you could possibly want or a restaurant?</p>
<p id="p-24">Something that you just know there's everything there?</p>
<p id="p-25">Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-26">Well, usually that's...</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-27">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-28">Well, usually that's a diner for me, but you know what, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-29">Diners are not really a thing out here.</p>
<p id="p-30">Yeah, sadly, it's really an East Coast.</p>
<p id="p-31">I think the diner was invented on the East Coast, I have a feeling.</p>
<p id="p-32">I feel like I've read that it was invented in Jersey, but I'm not sure.</p>
<p id="p-33">Our listeners will have to research that.</p>
<p id="p-34">I have a feeling it's Jersey because Jersey is like the diner state.</p>
<p id="p-35">Yeah, there's a lot of diners here, a lot.</p>
<p id="p-36">But okay, what is a diner?</p>
<p id="p-37">A diner is the place where you can go and get pretty much anything.</p>
<p id="p-38">When I think of a restaurant where I could get anything, usually they have huge, well, in New York and New Jersey, they're often open all night, which is very cool.</p>
<p id="p-39">You get a huge menu and it's got tons of things on it.</p>
<p id="p-40">Usually the food is not necessarily outstanding, but it's good enough for a midnight snack or a nice breakfast with your friends.</p>
<p id="p-41">And it's just a true experience, cultural experience.</p>
<p id="p-42">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-43">Yeah, so we love diners here in New Jersey.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-44">Yeah, we love diners here in New Jersey.</p>
<p id="p-45">So today we are going to answer a really fun question from Omid that came to us on YouTube.</p>
<p id="p-46">Yeah, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-47">And here is the question.</p>
<p id="p-48">By the way, guys, don't forget that we have an entire YouTube channel for All Ears English.</p>
<p id="p-49">So if you'd rather watch this episode, which some people prefer to listen, some people prefer to watch, go over to YouTube and hit the subscribe button today so you don't miss a single episode.</p>
<p id="p-50">We put all five episodes over there on All Ears English on YouTube.</p>
<p id="p-51">That's right.</p>
<p id="p-52">All right, so here's Omid's question.</p>
<p id="p-53">Hi, Lindsay and Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-54">I love your podcast a lot and the way both of you explain the natural expressions.</p>
<p id="p-55">Recently, I've come across an idiom called you name it, we've got it.</p>
<p id="p-56">And was wondering if there's a common daily natural expression, if this is a common natural expression in conversation.</p>
<p id="p-57">Could you please make a video and explain about it?</p>
<p id="p-58">Thanks so much.</p>
<p id="p-59">I love you all.</p>
<p id="p-60">Omid from Iran.</p>
<p id="p-61">Beautiful.</p>
<p id="p-62">All right.</p>
<p id="p-63">Yeah, that is a great question.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-64">All right, yeah, that is a great question.</p>
<p id="p-65">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-66">Yeah, definitely now that you're saying it, it makes me think of diners.</p>
<p id="p-67">100%. We're gonna get into this today.</p>
<p id="p-68">Great question.</p>
<p id="p-69">Guys, remember to hit the follow button wherever you listen to All Ears English.</p>
<p id="p-70">So, Lindsay, do you hear people say this?</p>
<p id="p-71">You name it, we've got it.</p>
<p id="p-72">This feels like something you'd hear from someone in the 90s, like spinning a sign outside of a dollar store or something, you know, trying to get people in there.</p>
<p id="p-73">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-74">It just feels like something from an age of heavy commercialism, right?</p>
<p id="p-75">But yeah, you might hear it, especially in a Walmart, a big box store.</p>
<p id="p-76">Yes, I think Kmart's gone now.</p>
<p id="p-77">I think Kmart's gone, isn't it?</p>
<p id="p-78">Kmart?</p>
<p id="p-79">Do you remember Kmart?</p>
<p id="p-80">Of course, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-81">No, I do remember Kmart.</p>
<p id="p-82">But yeah, actually, yeah, now that you think of it, I know there was one in New York that closed down.</p>
<p id="p-83">I think they're closing.</p>
<p id="p-84">But I didn't realize they were all gone.</p>
<p id="p-85">I haven't seen a Kmart.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-86">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-87">I haven't seen a Kmart in a while.</p>
<p id="p-88">No, there might still be a few.</p>
<p id="p-89">It's a competitor to Walmart, but Walmart kind of won out in the end.</p>
<p id="p-90">But essentially, these big box stores are kind of common in the United States, right?</p>
<p id="p-91">We can walk in, we can buy pretty much anything in that store.</p>
<p id="p-92">Yeah, I think we did a whole episode about Costco, didn't we?</p>
<p id="p-93">We did.</p>
<p id="p-94">Costco for sure.</p>
<p id="p-95">The Costco effect.</p>
<p id="p-96">Yes, The Costco effect, that's right.</p>
<p id="p-97">So, yeah, I mean, you would hear this.</p>
<p id="p-98">You might hear it at a store, like a big box store, restaurant, cafe.</p>
<p id="p-99">I mean, I was also thinking some sort of client service, like a party planner, a florist, something like that.</p>
<p id="p-100">Anywhere where you're getting something from a selection of items.</p>
<p id="p-101">Who might say this?</p>
<p id="p-102">Who's going to be the person who says this?</p>
<p id="p-103">Well, I think certainly the owner of the business, if they're present on the floor of the store or the restaurant, the barista, maybe just a floor manager.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-104">The floor manager, someone who's in charge of selling, maybe?</p>
<p id="p-105">Or signs?</p>
<p id="p-106">I think more often you'd see this on a sign, actually.</p>
<p id="p-107">Ah, could be that too.</p>
<p id="p-108">Yeah, I mean, and if you're the one doing the buying, you could say it.</p>
<p id="p-109">I mean, let's say you're recommending a store to someone, you could say, oh, you name it, they've got it, right?</p>
<p id="p-110">But let's do some examples here.</p>
<p id="p-111">Here we're at the coffee shop.</p>
<p id="p-112">All right, perfect.</p>
<p id="p-113">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-114">Let's do it, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-115">All right, what kind of milk do you have?</p>
<p id="p-116">Almond milk, cashew milk, soy, 2%, half and half, you name it, we've got it.</p>
<p id="p-117">Great.</p>
<p id="p-118">Yeah, I guess your local barista might say that too, right?</p>
<p id="p-119">Though I find that often these trendy cafes tend to have just one thing, like they might have almond milk and then that's it.</p>
<p id="p-120">Maybe almond milk and skim milk.</p>
<p id="p-121">They usually don't have the whole gamut of options from what I've seen, at least.</p>
<p id="p-122">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-123">Yeah, it really depends.</p>
<p id="p-124">Well, you don't get any milk, right, because you drink it black.</p>
<p id="p-125">No, I don't.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-126">Because you drink it black.</p>
<p id="p-127">No, I don't. That's right.</p>
<p id="p-128">But usually, like, I'll hear, you know, if someone I'm with asks for it or something, yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-129">Yeah, Awesome.</p>
<p id="p-130">All right.</p>
<p id="p-131">So here we go.</p>
<p id="p-132">Here's another one.</p>
<p id="p-133">Now we're at the shoe store.</p>
<p id="p-134">All right.</p>
<p id="p-135">Do you have a size seven?</p>
<p id="p-136">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-137">You name it.</p>
<p id="p-138">We've got it.</p>
<p id="p-139">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-140">All right.</p>
<p id="p-141">Well, I would hope they would have all this size, but not always, right?</p>
<p id="p-142">Not always.</p>
<p id="p-143">No, not always at all.</p>
<p id="p-144">But yeah, Lindsay, I mean, so how does this feel to you?</p>
<p id="p-145">You've kind of touched on it.</p>
<p id="p-146">It seems to you, like, to me, I felt it's kind of casual, cool, and breezy.</p>
<p id="p-147">But to you, the way you're talking about it, it sounds like you have a different impression of it.</p>
<p id="p-148">No, I mean, I think it's common.</p>
<p id="p-149">I think it sounds, it just depends on what kind of store you're in.</p>
<p id="p-150">It just reminds me of just a heavily commercial environment, right?</p>
<p id="p-151">Where people, there's just a lot of buying happening, right?</p>
<p id="p-152">We have everything you could possibly want, right?</p>
<p id="p-153">Right, right.</p>
<p id="p-154">It reminds me of a bygone era, you know?</p>
<p id="p-155">Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-156">Yeah, I mean, I think it's generally positive.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-157">I mean, I think it's generally positive.</p>
<p id="p-158">I mean, like the only context I could think of it is totally different.</p>
<p id="p-159">I mean, like talking about sickness.</p>
<p id="p-160">So, for example, let's do this.</p>
<p id="p-161">Lindsay, well, I'll ask you, did you get a lot of the typical winter illnesses this year?</p>
<p id="p-162">No, not really.</p>
<p id="p-163">I actually don't think I got a head cold this year.</p>
<p id="p-164">What about you, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-165">Did you stay healthy or did you catch something?</p>
<p id="p-166">I mean, I definitely had a few colds, but I'm scared to say anything because it was a really everybody on the East Coast was super sick this whole winter.</p>
<p id="p-167">But you might hear something like this.</p>
<p id="p-168">Oh, it's been such a rough winter.</p>
<p id="p-169">Yeah, Oh, gosh.</p>
<p id="p-170">Did you get the flu?</p>
<p id="p-171">You name it, we got it.</p>
<p id="p-172">Stomach bug, flu, all of it.</p>
<p id="p-173">Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-174">Yeah, So that's another good example.</p>
<p id="p-175">Or I guess another scenario could be if you have a friend over to your house and they're not feeling well, maybe they need like aspirin.</p>
<p id="p-176">You have all the kinds of aspirin, Tylenol, Advil.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-177">of aspirin, Tylenol, Advil, whatever it is.</p>
<p id="p-178">Then you open your medicine cabinet, you name it, we've got it.</p>
<p id="p-179">What do you need, right?</p>
<p id="p-180">Yeah, right, right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-181">But generally you would hear this more in a commercial sense.</p>
<p id="p-182">You go to a store, it's really about buying things, right?</p>
<p id="p-183">Yeah, yep, yep, yep.</p>
<p id="p-184">Okay, love it.</p>
<p id="p-185">Michelle, what are some other things that we might say?</p>
<p id="p-186">Because we don't want to always be saying the same thing, especially if we work on the floor of a store, a big box store.</p>
<p id="p-187">What else could we say?</p>
<p id="p-188">All right, well, you could say anything and everything.</p>
<p id="p-189">For example, check out our candy selection.</p>
<p id="p-190">We have anything and everything you could think of.</p>
<p id="p-191">Oh, nice.</p>
<p id="p-192">Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.</p>
<p id="p-193">Also you could say, we've got it all.</p>
<p id="p-194">So you could say, yes, we do have a ton of stickers.</p>
<p id="p-195">We've got it all, dinosaur stickers, stars, princesses, all of it.</p>
<p id="p-196">Yes, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-197">So this is good before listing things or after.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-198">before listing things or after listing things, right?</p>
<p id="p-199">For example, we have a giant selection.</p>
<p id="p-200">So this is maybe more direct, more commercial sounding.</p>
<p id="p-201">We have a giant selection of gift wrap here, so take a look around.</p>
<p id="p-202">Yeah, Yeah, I mean, and you could also use it to recommend something to someone, right?</p>
<p id="p-203">So if you want to talk about a place's inventory, you name it, they've got it, right?</p>
<p id="p-204">So like, you know, Target.</p>
<p id="p-205">Oh, head on over to Target if you're looking for XYZ, you name it, they've got it, right?</p>
<p id="p-206">I mean, Lindsay, do you shop at any, like what's your big box store of choice?</p>
<p id="p-207">Not really.</p>
<p id="p-208">Yeah, I think it's Amazon, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-209">Yeah, that's the way we're all going, right?</p>
<p id="p-210">I mean, if I need toilet paper or just like printer paper for my printer, I will usually just go to Amazon.</p>
<p id="p-211">Yeah, so that's what I do.</p>
<p id="p-212">What about</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-213">So that's what I do.</p>
<p id="p-214">What about you, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-215">Do you go to Target?</p>
<p id="p-216">I will go to Target, but I make the mistake of going with my kids to these places.</p>
<p id="p-217">I'm like, oh, let's do it.</p>
<p id="p-218">It's horrible.</p>
<p id="p-219">I mean, it is just, it is a nightmare.</p>
<p id="p-220">They see something they want, right?</p>
<p id="p-221">And then they... Yeah, they all walk out with toys.</p>
<p id="p-222">I don't think I bought anything for myself in a year.</p>
<p id="p-223">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-224">I'm like, oh, can I look?</p>
<p id="p-225">And no.</p>
<p id="p-226">Oh, no.</p>
<p id="p-227">We just have to go to Costco a couple times because we had my daughter's birthday party.</p>
<p id="p-228">Oh, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-229">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-230">Yeah, so we were there and then it's, yeah, it's an experience.</p>
<p id="p-231">Guys, you should listen to, we just did an episode about saying experience.</p>
<p id="p-232">So definitely head on over and listen to that one.</p>
<p id="p-233">But yeah, so let's do another role play.</p>
<p id="p-234">We've done a few mini ones.</p>
<p id="p-235">Let's do one more before we go.</p>
<p id="p-236">All right, and this time we're in a flower shop.</p>
<p id="p-237">I love...</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-238">All right, and this time we're in a flower shop.</p>
<p id="p-239">I love being in flower shops, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-240">It's just I want to smell everything, you know?</p>
<p id="p-241">It's just it's an awesome experience.</p>
<p id="p-242">So here you work at a flower shop.</p>
<p id="p-243">Lucky you.</p>
<p id="p-244">That sounds like a dream retirement plan.</p>
<p id="p-245">Yes, And I am looking for flowers.</p>
<p id="p-246">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-247">Yes, Hi, do you have azaleas?</p>
<p id="p-248">Yes, we have a giant selection.</p>
<p id="p-249">Feel free to take a look around.</p>
<p id="p-250">Oh, thanks.</p>
<p id="p-251">Oh, wow.</p>
<p id="p-252">You've got it all.</p>
<p id="p-253">Look at these.</p>
<p id="p-254">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-255">Thanks.</p>
<p id="p-256">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-257">Anything and everything.</p>
<p id="p-258">I see.</p>
<p id="p-259">Oh, and do you have tulips?</p>
<p id="p-260">Yellow tulips?</p>
<p id="p-261">Oh, yes.</p>
<p id="p-262">You name it, we've got it right over there in that corner.</p>
<p id="p-263">Excellent.</p>
<p id="p-264">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-265">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-266">So yeah, I definitely I agree that it's friendly.</p>
<p id="p-267">It's kind of showing good service at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-268">But what I was saying earlier, broadly, it points to like a massive amount of selection in a commercial market, you know, so it's kind of both like the person on the floor is</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-269">Like the person on the floor is being friendly, but also there are a ton of options, which I don't think is true everywhere, right?</p>
<p id="p-270">Like there's just a lot of things you could buy because our economy is so dependent on buying.</p>
<p id="p-271">Yeah, right?</p>
<p id="p-272">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-273">Do you buy flowers for your home?</p>
<p id="p-274">I wish I did more often.</p>
<p id="p-275">I wish I did.</p>
<p id="p-276">Because when I do, I think, oh, this was a great thing to do.</p>
<p id="p-277">It just brightens up the kitchen.</p>
<p id="p-278">I think you told me once you did do that a lot.</p>
<p id="p-279">That's really funny that you remember that.</p>
<p id="p-280">Yeah, I used to.</p>
<p id="p-281">I always get into it.</p>
<p id="p-282">I'm like, oh, I'm going to start buying flowers every week, and then it never happens.</p>
<p id="p-283">My friend gave me some flowers recently because she was going on vacation, and she's like, these flowers are just going to die, so you might as well enjoy them for a little bit.</p>
<p id="p-284">Beautiful.</p>
<p id="p-285">Yeah, So I have some tulips.</p>
<p id="p-286">They're all dying, but that's, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-287">But I think especially in the springtime, it's really nice to bring spring.</p>
<p id="p-288">Tulips are a spring flower, right?</p>
<p id="p-289">Or no, they're a winter, spring, winter.</p>
<p id="p-290">I don't know anything.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-291">I don't know anything about flowers, do you?</p>
<p id="p-292">We'll change the subject quickly.</p>
<p id="p-293">Let's go back to the roleplayers.</p>
<p id="p-294">Anyway, let's talk about boy bands of the early 2000s.</p>
<p id="p-295">That is your wheelhouse.</p>
<p id="p-296">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-297">All right, good stuff.</p>
<p id="p-298">Next episode, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-299">All right.</p>
<p id="p-300">So here I asked you, do you have azaleas?</p>
<p id="p-301">And you said, yes, we have a giant selection, right?</p>
<p id="p-302">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-303">And then you said, oh, wow, you've got it all.</p>
<p id="p-304">Look at all these.</p>
<p id="p-305">I mean, this sounds like an amazing shop.</p>
<p id="p-306">Totally.</p>
<p id="p-307">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-308">And then you said, yep, thanks.</p>
<p id="p-309">Anything and everything, right?</p>
<p id="p-310">Anything and everything, as you said.</p>
<p id="p-311">And then you said what, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-312">Well, you asked me, do you have yellow tulips?</p>
<p id="p-313">And I said, yes, you name it, we've got it right over there in that corner.</p>
<p id="p-314">Right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-315">Very friendly salesperson on the floor.</p>
<p id="p-316">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-317">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-318">And Michelle, is there another episode that we could check out today?</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-319">that we could check out today just as we're finishing up today's episode?</p>
<p id="p-320">Yes, this was really fun.</p>
<p id="p-321">I loved this episode.</p>
<p id="p-322">We had a good time with this one.</p>
<p id="p-323">Really good one.</p>
<p id="p-324">Check out episode 2385 that was Order in the Court, Everyday Courtroom English.</p>
<p id="p-325">Yes, Order in the Court.</p>
<p id="p-326">That was one of my favorite episodes.</p>
<p id="p-327">It is so cool when we take these, I don't know, these fields, these industries, these areas of life and we bring it into English.</p>
<p id="p-328">Yeah, I love that kind of episode.</p>
<p id="p-329">Yeah, So Michelle, what's the takeaway for today?</p>
<p id="p-330">Oh man, well, we've talked today a lot about really commercialism and buying things and how we express that in different contexts.</p>
<p id="p-331">It can be used in kind of a car salesman type of way, like anything and everything.</p>
<p id="p-332">But at the same time, your local barista could say it as well.</p>
<p id="p-333">So you will hear this.</p>
<p id="p-334">Good to know.</p>
<p id="p-335">And yeah, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-336">And it's important to know</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-337">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-338">And it's important to know if someone says this, they're not trying to push things on you most of the time, right?</p>
<p id="p-339">Unless you are in a salesy situation, maybe like a car buying situation, they're just trying to be friendly.</p>
<p id="p-340">So love it.</p>
<p id="p-341">Good stuff, Michelle, and you have a good day.</p>
<p id="p-342">I'll see you very soon.</p>
<p id="p-343">All right.</p>
<p id="p-344">Thanks, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-345">Bye.</p>
