<p>Hey, Lindsay, how are you?</p>
<p>I'm doing fantastic, Michelle.</p>
<p>How's everything in your world today?</p>
<p>Everything's good.</p>
<p>Lindsay, do you have any stores near you that have just everything you could possibly want or a restaurant?</p>
<p>Something that you just know there's everything there?</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>Well, usually that's...</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Well, usually that's a diner for me, but you know what, Michelle?</p>
<p>Diners are not really a thing out here.</p>
<p>Yeah, sadly, it's really an East Coast.</p>
<p>I think the diner was invented on the East Coast, I have a feeling.</p>
<p>I feel like I've read that it was invented in Jersey, but I'm not sure.</p>
<p>Our listeners will have to research that.</p>
<p>I have a feeling it's Jersey because Jersey is like the diner state.</p>
<p>Yeah, there's a lot of diners here, a lot.</p>
<p>But okay, what is a diner?</p>
<p>A diner is the place where you can go and get pretty much anything.</p>
<p>When I think of a restaurant where I could get anything, usually they have huge, well, in New York and New Jersey, they're often open all night, which is very cool.</p>
<p>You get a huge menu and it's got tons of things on it.</p>
<p>Usually the food is not necessarily outstanding, but it's good enough for a midnight snack or a nice breakfast with your friends.</p>
<p>And it's just a true experience, cultural experience.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we love diners here in New Jersey.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>Yeah, we love diners here in New Jersey.</p>
<p>So today we are going to answer a really fun question from Omid that came to us on YouTube.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love it.</p>
<p>And here is the question.</p>
<p>By the way, guys, don't forget that we have an entire YouTube channel for All Ears English.</p>
<p>So if you'd rather watch this episode, which some people prefer to listen, some people prefer to watch, go over to YouTube and hit the subscribe button today so you don't miss a single episode.</p>
<p>We put all five episodes over there on All Ears English on YouTube.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>All right, so here's Omid's question.</p>
<p>Hi, Lindsay and Michelle.</p>
<p>I love your podcast a lot and the way both of you explain the natural expressions.</p>
<p>Recently, I've come across an idiom called you name it, we've got it.</p>
<p>And was wondering if there's a common daily natural expression, if this is a common natural expression in conversation.</p>
<p>Could you please make a video and explain about it?</p>
<p>Thanks so much.</p>
<p>I love you all.</p>
<p>Omid from Iran.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Yeah, that is a great question.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>All right, yeah, that is a great question.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely now that you're saying it, it makes me think of diners.</p>
<p>100%. We're gonna get into this today.</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>Guys, remember to hit the follow button wherever you listen to All Ears English.</p>
<p>So, Lindsay, do you hear people say this?</p>
<p>You name it, we've got it.</p>
<p>This feels like something you'd hear from someone in the 90s, like spinning a sign outside of a dollar store or something, you know, trying to get people in there.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>It just feels like something from an age of heavy commercialism, right?</p>
<p>But yeah, you might hear it, especially in a Walmart, a big box store.</p>
<p>Yes, I think Kmart's gone now.</p>
<p>I think Kmart's gone, isn't it?</p>
<p>Kmart?</p>
<p>Do you remember Kmart?</p>
<p>Of course, yeah.</p>
<p>No, I do remember Kmart.</p>
<p>But yeah, actually, yeah, now that you think of it, I know there was one in New York that closed down.</p>
<p>I think they're closing.</p>
<p>But I didn't realize they were all gone.</p>
<p>I haven't seen a Kmart.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I haven't seen a Kmart in a while.</p>
<p>No, there might still be a few.</p>
<p>It's a competitor to Walmart, but Walmart kind of won out in the end.</p>
<p>But essentially, these big box stores are kind of common in the United States, right?</p>
<p>We can walk in, we can buy pretty much anything in that store.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think we did a whole episode about Costco, didn't we?</p>
<p>We did.</p>
<p>Costco for sure.</p>
<p>The Costco effect.</p>
<p>Yes, The Costco effect, that's right.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I mean, you would hear this.</p>
<p>You might hear it at a store, like a big box store, restaurant, cafe.</p>
<p>I mean, I was also thinking some sort of client service, like a party planner, a florist, something like that.</p>
<p>Anywhere where you're getting something from a selection of items.</p>
<p>Who might say this?</p>
<p>Who's going to be the person who says this?</p>
<p>Well, I think certainly the owner of the business, if they're present on the floor of the store or the restaurant, the barista, maybe just a floor manager.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>The floor manager, someone who's in charge of selling, maybe?</p>
<p>Or signs?</p>
<p>I think more often you'd see this on a sign, actually.</p>
<p>Ah, could be that too.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, and if you're the one doing the buying, you could say it.</p>
<p>I mean, let's say you're recommending a store to someone, you could say, oh, you name it, they've got it, right?</p>
<p>But let's do some examples here.</p>
<p>Here we're at the coffee shop.</p>
<p>All right, perfect.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Let's do it, Michelle.</p>
<p>All right, what kind of milk do you have?</p>
<p>Almond milk, cashew milk, soy, 2%, half and half, you name it, we've got it.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess your local barista might say that too, right?</p>
<p>Though I find that often these trendy cafes tend to have just one thing, like they might have almond milk and then that's it.</p>
<p>Maybe almond milk and skim milk.</p>
<p>They usually don't have the whole gamut of options from what I've seen, at least.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it really depends.</p>
<p>Well, you don't get any milk, right, because you drink it black.</p>
<p>No, I don't.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>Because you drink it black.</p>
<p>No, I don't. That's right.</p>
<p>But usually, like, I'll hear, you know, if someone I'm with asks for it or something, yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, Awesome.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So here we go.</p>
<p>Here's another one.</p>
<p>Now we're at the shoe store.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Do you have a size seven?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>You name it.</p>
<p>We've got it.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, I would hope they would have all this size, but not always, right?</p>
<p>Not always.</p>
<p>No, not always at all.</p>
<p>But yeah, Lindsay, I mean, so how does this feel to you?</p>
<p>You've kind of touched on it.</p>
<p>It seems to you, like, to me, I felt it's kind of casual, cool, and breezy.</p>
<p>But to you, the way you're talking about it, it sounds like you have a different impression of it.</p>
<p>No, I mean, I think it's common.</p>
<p>I think it sounds, it just depends on what kind of store you're in.</p>
<p>It just reminds me of just a heavily commercial environment, right?</p>
<p>Where people, there's just a lot of buying happening, right?</p>
<p>We have everything you could possibly want, right?</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>It reminds me of a bygone era, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think it's generally positive.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>I mean, I think it's generally positive.</p>
<p>I mean, like the only context I could think of it is totally different.</p>
<p>I mean, like talking about sickness.</p>
<p>So, for example, let's do this.</p>
<p>Lindsay, well, I'll ask you, did you get a lot of the typical winter illnesses this year?</p>
<p>No, not really.</p>
<p>I actually don't think I got a head cold this year.</p>
<p>What about you, Michelle?</p>
<p>Did you stay healthy or did you catch something?</p>
<p>I mean, I definitely had a few colds, but I'm scared to say anything because it was a really everybody on the East Coast was super sick this whole winter.</p>
<p>But you might hear something like this.</p>
<p>Oh, it's been such a rough winter.</p>
<p>Yeah, Oh, gosh.</p>
<p>Did you get the flu?</p>
<p>You name it, we got it.</p>
<p>Stomach bug, flu, all of it.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>Yeah, So that's another good example.</p>
<p>Or I guess another scenario could be if you have a friend over to your house and they're not feeling well, maybe they need like aspirin.</p>
<p>You have all the kinds of aspirin, Tylenol, Advil.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>of aspirin, Tylenol, Advil, whatever it is.</p>
<p>Then you open your medicine cabinet, you name it, we've got it.</p>
<p>What do you need, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, right, right, exactly.</p>
<p>But generally you would hear this more in a commercial sense.</p>
<p>You go to a store, it's really about buying things, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, yep, yep, yep.</p>
<p>Okay, love it.</p>
<p>Michelle, what are some other things that we might say?</p>
<p>Because we don't want to always be saying the same thing, especially if we work on the floor of a store, a big box store.</p>
<p>What else could we say?</p>
<p>All right, well, you could say anything and everything.</p>
<p>For example, check out our candy selection.</p>
<p>We have anything and everything you could think of.</p>
<p>Oh, nice.</p>
<p>Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.</p>
<p>Also you could say, we've got it all.</p>
<p>So you could say, yes, we do have a ton of stickers.</p>
<p>We've got it all, dinosaur stickers, stars, princesses, all of it.</p>
<p>Yes, I love it.</p>
<p>So this is good before listing things or after.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>before listing things or after listing things, right?</p>
<p>For example, we have a giant selection.</p>
<p>So this is maybe more direct, more commercial sounding.</p>
<p>We have a giant selection of gift wrap here, so take a look around.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, I mean, and you could also use it to recommend something to someone, right?</p>
<p>So if you want to talk about a place's inventory, you name it, they've got it, right?</p>
<p>So like, you know, Target.</p>
<p>Oh, head on over to Target if you're looking for XYZ, you name it, they've got it, right?</p>
<p>I mean, Lindsay, do you shop at any, like what's your big box store of choice?</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it's Amazon, Michelle.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's the way we're all going, right?</p>
<p>I mean, if I need toilet paper or just like printer paper for my printer, I will usually just go to Amazon.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that's what I do.</p>
<p>What about</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>So that's what I do.</p>
<p>What about you, Michelle?</p>
<p>Do you go to Target?</p>
<p>I will go to Target, but I make the mistake of going with my kids to these places.</p>
<p>I'm like, oh, let's do it.</p>
<p>It's horrible.</p>
<p>I mean, it is just, it is a nightmare.</p>
<p>They see something they want, right?</p>
<p>And then they... Yeah, they all walk out with toys.</p>
<p>I don't think I bought anything for myself in a year.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I'm like, oh, can I look?</p>
<p>And no.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>We just have to go to Costco a couple times because we had my daughter's birthday party.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we were there and then it's, yeah, it's an experience.</p>
<p>Guys, you should listen to, we just did an episode about saying experience.</p>
<p>So definitely head on over and listen to that one.</p>
<p>But yeah, so let's do another role play.</p>
<p>We've done a few mini ones.</p>
<p>Let's do one more before we go.</p>
<p>All right, and this time we're in a flower shop.</p>
<p>I love...</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>All right, and this time we're in a flower shop.</p>
<p>I love being in flower shops, Michelle.</p>
<p>It's just I want to smell everything, you know?</p>
<p>It's just it's an awesome experience.</p>
<p>So here you work at a flower shop.</p>
<p>Lucky you.</p>
<p>That sounds like a dream retirement plan.</p>
<p>Yes, And I am looking for flowers.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yes, Hi, do you have azaleas?</p>
<p>Yes, we have a giant selection.</p>
<p>Feel free to take a look around.</p>
<p>Oh, thanks.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>You've got it all.</p>
<p>Look at these.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Anything and everything.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Oh, and do you have tulips?</p>
<p>Yellow tulips?</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>You name it, we've got it right over there in that corner.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>So yeah, I definitely I agree that it's friendly.</p>
<p>It's kind of showing good service at the same time.</p>
<p>But what I was saying earlier, broadly, it points to like a massive amount of selection in a commercial market, you know, so it's kind of both like the person on the floor is</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>Like the person on the floor is being friendly, but also there are a ton of options, which I don't think is true everywhere, right?</p>
<p>Like there's just a lot of things you could buy because our economy is so dependent on buying.</p>
<p>Yeah, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Do you buy flowers for your home?</p>
<p>I wish I did more often.</p>
<p>I wish I did.</p>
<p>Because when I do, I think, oh, this was a great thing to do.</p>
<p>It just brightens up the kitchen.</p>
<p>I think you told me once you did do that a lot.</p>
<p>That's really funny that you remember that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I used to.</p>
<p>I always get into it.</p>
<p>I'm like, oh, I'm going to start buying flowers every week, and then it never happens.</p>
<p>My friend gave me some flowers recently because she was going on vacation, and she's like, these flowers are just going to die, so you might as well enjoy them for a little bit.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>Yeah, So I have some tulips.</p>
<p>They're all dying, but that's, yeah.</p>
<p>But I think especially in the springtime, it's really nice to bring spring.</p>
<p>Tulips are a spring flower, right?</p>
<p>Or no, they're a winter, spring, winter.</p>
<p>I don't know anything.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>I don't know anything about flowers, do you?</p>
<p>We'll change the subject quickly.</p>
<p>Let's go back to the roleplayers.</p>
<p>Anyway, let's talk about boy bands of the early 2000s.</p>
<p>That is your wheelhouse.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>All right, good stuff.</p>
<p>Next episode, Michelle.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So here I asked you, do you have azaleas?</p>
<p>And you said, yes, we have a giant selection, right?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And then you said, oh, wow, you've got it all.</p>
<p>Look at all these.</p>
<p>I mean, this sounds like an amazing shop.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And then you said, yep, thanks.</p>
<p>Anything and everything, right?</p>
<p>Anything and everything, as you said.</p>
<p>And then you said what, Michelle?</p>
<p>Well, you asked me, do you have yellow tulips?</p>
<p>And I said, yes, you name it, we've got it right over there in that corner.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>Very friendly salesperson on the floor.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>And Michelle, is there another episode that we could check out today?</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>that we could check out today just as we're finishing up today's episode?</p>
<p>Yes, this was really fun.</p>
<p>I loved this episode.</p>
<p>We had a good time with this one.</p>
<p>Really good one.</p>
<p>Check out episode 2385 that was Order in the Court, Everyday Courtroom English.</p>
<p>Yes, Order in the Court.</p>
<p>That was one of my favorite episodes.</p>
<p>It is so cool when we take these, I don't know, these fields, these industries, these areas of life and we bring it into English.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love that kind of episode.</p>
<p>Yeah, So Michelle, what's the takeaway for today?</p>
<p>Oh man, well, we've talked today a lot about really commercialism and buying things and how we express that in different contexts.</p>
<p>It can be used in kind of a car salesman type of way, like anything and everything.</p>
<p>But at the same time, your local barista could say it as well.</p>
<p>So you will hear this.</p>
<p>Good to know.</p>
<p>And yeah, I love it.</p>
<p>And it's important to know</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And it's important to know if someone says this, they're not trying to push things on you most of the time, right?</p>
<p>Unless you are in a salesy situation, maybe like a car buying situation, they're just trying to be friendly.</p>
<p>So love it.</p>
<p>Good stuff, Michelle, and you have a good day.</p>
<p>I'll see you very soon.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Thanks, Lindsay.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Take care.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
