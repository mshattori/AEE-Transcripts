<p>Has anyone lashed out at you? Last week? We talked about idioms to say you're angry.</p>
<p>But today, what can you say if you're on the receiving end of this anger? How can you share these experiences with others in English? Listen in today.</p>
<p>Hey there, Aubrey, what's going on today? How you doing today is a wonderful day.</p>
<p>I'm so excited and I can't wait to hear your answer to this question.</p>
<p>Lindsay.</p>
<p>Have you ever really bitten someone's head off? Oh, man, I don't know if I'm not sure if this would qualify as biting someone's head off because I feel like when you bite someone's head off it's out of the blue.</p>
<p>It's unexpected.</p>
<p>It's like more than you would think.</p>
<p>It's kind of coming more from you.</p>
<p>But I was in an, um, a verbal altercation, I guess you could say just an argument with someone.</p>
<p>Um, there's very few people that I don't like, but this particular person I do not like.</p>
<p>And I came head to head with her verbally, uh, about a month ago when I was out in California and I, I would say I was assertive.</p>
<p>I stood my ground and I asked her to leave.</p>
<p>Um, it, it wasn't a exactly biting someone's head off.</p>
<p>But I love that you're making the distinction here because I very much agree.</p>
<p>You held your ground.</p>
<p>You were assertive, there was an altercation, but I agree.</p>
<p>I wouldn't call that biting someone's head off because this is so much more extreme.</p>
<p>Like you have to really yell at someone, snap at someone that needs to be really elevated emotions to where later you might say I should have had handled that more calmly, maybe.</p>
<p>Whereas it sounds like your interaction with this woman, it sounds like you stayed pretty calm and were right.</p>
<p>Usually it's more like she bit our heads off like she was like, she was kind of attacking my brother actually.</p>
<p>And then I started talking to her.</p>
<p>I was just like, if you're not happy with this leave, you know, just leave.</p>
<p>And so, so the difference is with biting someone's head off.</p>
<p>It's always one person that's out of sync and that one person is acting out, the other person is usually just taking it in being the victim or not really responding or something.</p>
<p>Right, We are going to share more about this idiom because I think there's so much here.</p>
<p>That's really interesting.</p>
<p>We use it to exaggerate even if it wasn't that bad.</p>
<p>You might be like she really bit my head off.</p>
<p>Right? Because you're sharing the story and exaggerating.</p>
<p>So we're going to dive into it and a few related idioms in English.</p>
<p>I love, I use them when I'm telling a story.</p>
<p>I think it adds a lot of interest that makes it more fun and interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you know, this happens to all of us at some point.</p>
<p>Someone bites your head off or you bite someone else's head off.</p>
<p>We're going to encounter this kind of moment.</p>
<p>It's such a violent, right? We'll get into it.</p>
<p>But of course, it's not literal, you imagine, right? All right.</p>
<p>Where do we start today then, Aubrey.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we first want to share that.</p>
<p>This is part two of a series and part one was Saturday, June 15th.</p>
<p>It was called four idioms to use when you see red.</p>
<p>And these were idioms about just when you get extremely anger, angry, you might be able to hold it in, you might not react.</p>
<p>Um Today's idioms are related but they're more about when you don't hold it in, you get super angry and you lash out or someone lashes out at you.</p>
<p>We're going to share these idioms but make sure to scroll up.</p>
<p>So you don't miss part one.</p>
<p>So we're really turning up the heat with these summer Saturday episodes.</p>
<p>Right? I'll bring all about anger and showing how to, you know, but they do say actually I have heard statisticss that violence increases in the summer.</p>
<p>I have heard that because of hot weather or maybe it's what I heard was more hot, hotter climates that can happen.</p>
<p>Uh, because I do think there's something about heat, like physical weather, heat, heat in the air that can make it easier to kind of lose it in a sense.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm so curious about that and it could just be discomfort if someone is uncomfortable or not.</p>
<p>We're already going to be a little bit maybe annoyed or frustrated and then they come out, you know, they say, I mean, do you see that in your, I do, I see that in myself, you know, I'm more likely to just sort of, uh, be less patient in a hot summer evening than I am in like a cool winter.</p>
<p>It's just, there's a difference.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So, yes, we do this right.</p>
<p>We might be yelling or criticizing someone heatedly.</p>
<p>I love this adverb heatedly.</p>
<p>It means when we say some things with heat and we're talking about emotion, it just means elevated, right? And especially heatedly we're talking about with anger.</p>
<p>You wouldn't say something nicely heatedly.</p>
<p>Yes, for sure, for sure.</p>
<p>So that was a bonus phrase for today, right? Aubrey, little bonus for a listener, guys write that one down and by the way, if you're consuming this episode in the app, check it out, make sure you're listening in the app, most of our episodes are transcribed right inside the app.</p>
<p>So you'll be able to tap on words and save them to your personal power list.</p>
<p>Yes, Yes, Then you don't have to write it down.</p>
<p>You can just click it.</p>
<p>You get an example, sentence, a definition so easy.</p>
<p>Yes, Good stuff.</p>
<p>Let's start with number one.</p>
<p>Aubrey.</p>
<p>What is it? Yes, So this is a phrasal verb.</p>
<p>I used it a moment ago.</p>
<p>Lash out because it's just so perfect.</p>
<p>Like you might say her client lashed out at her when she didn't file the paperwork on time.</p>
<p>It means you are angrily, you know, either yelling at someone or snapping at someone.</p>
<p>We say that, but it's definitely lash out.</p>
<p>It's like you said, Lindsay, it's sort of out of nowhere.</p>
<p>It's out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Maybe it's built up to the person that's being lashed out at.</p>
<p>It feels like very extreme and sort of out of nowhere unexpected.</p>
<p>They don't, maybe they don't know it's been building up.</p>
<p>I mean, this is why we have to talk about our feelings, you know, and we experience them because so we're not bottling them up.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that's when we lash out.</p>
<p>I feel this in myself.</p>
<p>I let a lot of things go and I'm just like, it's not worth it, but I'm building up emotion, maybe resentment and then I lash out at someone, someone's going to bear the brunt of it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We're all all guilty of that in some way.</p>
<p>Right, Lash out.</p>
<p>So the next example, I've seen a few celebrities lash out at paparazzi.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, I mean we hear those stories.</p>
<p>Someone grabs the camera and smashes it.</p>
<p>Right, This is coming from this anger, right? It's an action.</p>
<p>They do heatedly.</p>
<p>They're upset.</p>
<p>Maybe if they weren't angry, they wouldn't do that.</p>
<p>They would speak more kindly calmly.</p>
<p>But you get angry, you get emotional and then you lash out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It makes me think a little bit of because we've been watching the Crown and you know, there's a narrative in maybe it's true.</p>
<p>I don't really know.</p>
<p>I'm not on the inside of the royal family, of course, but you know, with Princess Diana and everything that happened with the paparazzi chasing her and then for the boys and the family just being so angry at paparazzi over so many years.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would imagine.</p>
<p>I can't imagine what that's like.</p>
<p>I can't imagine.</p>
<p>No, I can't either.</p>
<p>This is why I, I'm very open about that.</p>
<p>I wouldn't want to be famous.</p>
<p>I think I would lash out at paparazzi if they were following me around or my Children.</p>
<p>If I felt my Children were threatened, I could see myself lashing out.</p>
<p>So it's better that no one knows me.</p>
<p>Mama bear would come out as we say, we don't need that.</p>
<p>Ok? If you guys heard the first episode of this series, you heard a crazy story about me lashing out at a mom at soccer.</p>
<p>Oh, it's a good story.</p>
<p>Go check the first episode.</p>
<p>So you don't miss it.</p>
<p>What's the status of your relationship with her? Now, are you guys? Ok, or no, I had, I hadn't met her then and I still haven't met her now.</p>
<p>I just yelled at her across the circle.</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe better.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>And this one's good.</p>
<p>Number two, tear into someone.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Yeah, very similar meaning to lash out.</p>
<p>We use it a ton.</p>
<p>You might say that coach was really tearing into his team and we've all seen this on the sidelines and the coach is just yelling really heatedly angrily.</p>
<p>Then we would say this, wow, he's really tearing into them.</p>
<p>Yeah, the coach is bright red and it looks like his head is about to explode, tears off his tie and throws it.</p>
<p>I feel like basketball coaches in the US are notorious for this.</p>
<p>The most famous example would be Bobby Knight right from Indianapolis back from the nineties.</p>
<p>I don't know anything about basketball, but I know Bobby Knight was famous for, I think, like throwing things at his team and just really, really lost it.</p>
<p>So many A S US coach, basketball coach does it.</p>
<p>Now, I couldn't tell you his name, but I find myself hardly watching the game.</p>
<p>I'm just watching him because he's getting so heated and upset.</p>
<p>He'll take off his tie and throw it.</p>
<p>He's stomping around.</p>
<p>It's so entertaining.</p>
<p>I had a, let's see, I was in the band in middle school and I had a, what do you call it? Like a, um, he was the conductor of the band or the kind of our teacher, a band teacher, he would just lose it.</p>
<p>Sometimes he would get so upset, especially at the drums.</p>
<p>All the drummers up there would mess up and he would start throwing things at us.</p>
<p>He was crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was wild.</p>
<p>It was like, oh, should you be a teacher? You have to have such patience as a teacher when a teacher lashes out and loses their temper.</p>
<p>I'm always kind of like, oh, no, you maybe chose the wrong person.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>You really need to have incredible patience.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So then another example she really tore into me when I thought, when she thought I hit her car.</p>
<p>Yes, And I have seen this, I have seen like someone, you know, you think there's an accident and then they tear.</p>
<p>Like what are you, da, da, da da.</p>
<p>Whether you did hit the car or not? Road rage, right? We see this a lot.</p>
<p>Someone will tear into someone else for sure.</p>
<p>And then they have their camera filming.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Just like people lose it so easily.</p>
<p>It's crazy.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Number three, bite someone's head off.</p>
<p>This is what we just talked about.</p>
<p>We talked about this one at the top of the episode.</p>
<p>Right? And this is very extreme.</p>
<p>Like you said, we might use it to exaggerate.</p>
<p>Right? Ok.</p>
<p>You don't have to bite my head off when someone really was just like, no, I don't want to do that.</p>
<p>Maybe they weren't that extreme.</p>
<p>This one, I don't know about you, Lindsay.</p>
<p>I use this a lot to exaggerate what someone else, what they were saying to let them know.</p>
<p>I still feel like they're either unreasonable or a little too heated.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So, just of pushing them back a little, letting them know they're a little out of line.</p>
<p>Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>And maybe they, maybe they weren't really biting my head off but whatever was happening, it was enough elevated, escalated heated that I'm like, ok, let's step back.</p>
<p>Let's take a chill pill.</p>
<p>Sometimes you have to send people signals.</p>
<p>Right, You have to send signals and maybe you need to exaggerate for them to get that message because people just see the stars when they're angry.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>They see red we taught in that and you don't need to kind of calm them down a little and escalate the situation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then he bit my head off when I was late to the meeting.</p>
<p>So this would be even worse in a business context.</p>
<p>Right? And this happens.</p>
<p>Right? And when you're telling the story to someone at work, this might be how you said it like, wow, he really bit my head off when I was late and maybe it was just like a firm rebuke.</p>
<p>But this is how it felt.</p>
<p>And when you tell the story, this is how you're going to say it interesting.</p>
<p>So it can happen at the workplace and it can happen in our social lives, in our community, things like that.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>OK, Oh, this next one feels a little bit more sinister.</p>
<p>Right, What is that? Yes, it's rake someone over the coals.</p>
<p>I grew up saying this.</p>
<p>What about you, Lindsay? Have you heard this? She really raked me over the coals, I guess.</p>
<p>I guess this kind of thing didn't happen to me that much.</p>
<p>I don't know, I didn't say it that much but I know it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yes, Right, We do say it.</p>
<p>I would say the other three we've taught are a little more common, I think because like you said, Lindsay, this feels more extreme.</p>
<p>I don't know that I would say this to, you know, I wouldn't say to someone OK, don't rake me over the coals, right? I would say, don't bite my head off.</p>
<p>So what would be an example of, you know, where that would make sense? What would someone do? You might say it if you're telling a story and saying that someone yelled at you or was something extreme, right? And this is usually more about a personal critique or criticism.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be so much about like they hit my car.</p>
<p>She really raked me over the coals.</p>
<p>It's more like she told me all of the things wrong with me and all the things she thinks I'm not doing.</p>
<p>That's what we mean.</p>
<p>When we say we're being raked over the coals, it also could have an element of public embarrassment, right? Maybe she did that in front of all your close friends and family too, right? Certainly possible.</p>
<p>It could, it could be just one person though, if someone, I'm alone with someone and they're telling me all the things, maybe all the ways, I'm a bad parent, I'd be like, wow, she really raked me over the coal.</p>
<p>So it involves a lot of stuff they're throwing at you.</p>
<p>Right? I think so.</p>
<p>It has to sort of be like multiple critiques whether you feel like they're earned or not.</p>
<p>Yes, Or here's another sample sentence.</p>
<p>I didn't mean to rake her over the coals, but I was pretty upset.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you might say this about yourself if you had this altercation.</p>
<p>And you like imagine Lindsay that experience you had with this woman.</p>
<p>If you then went off to say you have done this and this and you are this and this and there's sort of, you know, multiple personal attacks or personal critiques that are heated, then she could go home and be like, wow, that Lindsay lady really rich over the coal.</p>
<p>You didn't do that.</p>
<p>I did not do that.</p>
<p>No, no, it was enough just to ask her to leave.</p>
<p>Please go home.</p>
<p>It was the better choice.</p>
<p>You took the high road.</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>All right, cool.</p>
<p>Aubrey.</p>
<p>Let's go into a role play, shall we? Let's do it in this role play.</p>
<p>I'm telling you about my daughter's teacher.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>Yes, My daughter is really struggling with her teacher.</p>
<p>I guess he lashes out at the students really often.</p>
<p>Oh, no, you have to have so much patience as a high school teacher.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>I guess whenever someone is late to class he really tears into them.</p>
<p>I feel bad for those students.</p>
<p>I had a teacher in high school that bit my head off once and it was awful.</p>
<p>She said yesterday he really raked her over the coals in front of the whole class.</p>
<p>Oh, that's hard.</p>
<p>That's hard for so terrible.</p>
<p>I have had my Children have had teachers like this, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Maybe not this extreme.</p>
<p>Like if he raked her over the coals in front of the class.</p>
<p>He would be like, you know, telling her you're always late and your assignments are terrible and that's just worst case scenario.</p>
<p>It's very extreme.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, that's really bad.</p>
<p>Hard for kids when they're just, you know, maybe the teacher says it in front of friends and they're, they're just trying to hide and blend in.</p>
<p>You do not want that public criticism or ostracism, which is like when they then are getting sort of left out or excluded worst case scenario for a teenager for sure.</p>
<p>And so first we used lashes out.</p>
<p>So you said my daughter's really struggling with her teacher, I guess he lashes out at the students really often.</p>
<p>Yeah, which does happen, right? That's just like angrily yelling, criticizing.</p>
<p>It's pretty extreme.</p>
<p>It's not like, you know, he reprimands the this is, that's very different, that sounds very calm and collected.</p>
<p>He's letting them know these behaviors need to change.</p>
<p>Lashing out is not calm and collected.</p>
<p>That means he has lost his temper and is yelling yes, 100%.</p>
<p>And then what did you say, Aubrey? Yes, And then I said, yeah, if someone's late, he really tears into them.</p>
<p>And this is like if someone's late and he comes in and he's like, why are you always always late? What is happening? This is going to be a conversation with the administrator like this would be that right? He's tearing into them, he's yelling at them about something.</p>
<p>This is not a calm interaction.</p>
<p>And then I said, oh, I feel bad for these students.</p>
<p>I had a teacher in high school that bit my head off once and it was awful.</p>
<p>We can all relate.</p>
<p>Like I shared the story about my band teacher, you know, and usually it's about the teacher about them not having control of their emotions.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Right, Because teenagers, yeah, they're going to try to get your goat.</p>
<p>I mean, I say that they're going to try and upset you.</p>
<p>They're going to try and create this interaction.</p>
<p>They're teasing.</p>
<p>So if the teacher doesn't have patience, this is going to happen.</p>
<p>They're teasing.</p>
<p>They're testing.</p>
<p>Right, There's a lot of testing that kids do for trying to get the other students to laugh just inevitable.</p>
<p>And then you said she said yesterday he really raked her over the coals in front of the whole class.</p>
<p>Right, Worst case scenario.</p>
<p>That's a very extreme.</p>
<p>I love all of these.</p>
<p>It is really a fun connection moment as a takeaway here to use these to exaggerate.</p>
<p>Like, maybe it wasn't that extreme.</p>
<p>It can get you in trouble.</p>
<p>Right, Someone might be like, ok, now, wait, what did they actually say? Because you're making it feel really extreme.</p>
<p>Maybe you might have to admit like, ok, it wasn't that bad but it really, I really hated it or whatever.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love this.</p>
<p>This is so cool.</p>
<p>Aubrey.</p>
<p>What's a takeaway today? I mean, I like that in the last few weekends we've been really going through.</p>
<p>It's not all, always perfect connection.</p>
<p>There are moments of conflict in life that's normal.</p>
<p>And how can we go and talk about it later? How can we take solace in our friends and share experiences? These are the words to do it.</p>
<p>Right, I agree.</p>
<p>I love this.</p>
<p>Right, We, we all try to keep our cool, but everyone has their moments like you said and discussing when this happens, admitting faults is a great way to deepen connections in English.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Glad we talked about this today, Aubrey guys go back and get that other episode from last weekend to complete this series.</p>
<p>This will be the final episode in this series, Aubrey.</p>
<p>No, absolutely.</p>
<p>And really when we talked about keeping your cool recently, that's very related as well.</p>
<p>So yes, be sure you're following here guys for all of these great episodes.</p>
