<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-19">see number one.</p>
<p id="p-20">Hello, Michelle, how are you doing?</p>
<p id="p-21">I'm good.</p>
<p id="p-22">How are you, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-23">Absolutely fantastic.</p>
<p id="p-24">Michelle, do you know anyone who is a huge sports fan?</p>
<p id="p-25">I know many people who are huge sports fans.</p>
<p id="p-26">I have friends who are huge sports fans.</p>
<p id="p-27">My nephew has turned into quite a huge sports fan.</p>
<p id="p-28">Number one, he plays sports.</p>
<p id="p-29">He's very athletic, which means that he's not from my family.</p>
<p id="p-30">But number two, he knows a lot about sports.</p>
<p id="p-31">Have you ever had this experience where you're friends with someone who is a huge sports fan and you're spending time with them and they're keep on checking the game?</p>
<p id="p-32">Yeah, sure.</p>
<p id="p-33">Yes, Yeah, I have friends who are like that, who they'll be sitting there watching.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-34">that who they'll be sitting there watching the game.</p>
<p id="p-35">And I have even done that once before.</p>
<p id="p-36">I remember last Mother's Day, there was a big Knicks game and I was just sitting watching the TV.</p>
<p id="p-37">But I'm normally not like that.</p>
<p id="p-38">Yeah, it can happen.</p>
<p id="p-39">And this is timely because we're in the middle of football season, which is the most like sports.</p>
<p id="p-40">I think there are just it's such a fanatic sport in America, in the United States of America.</p>
<p id="p-41">People are just so into their football.</p>
<p id="p-42">And people just go crazy.</p>
<p id="p-43">Especially if you went to a big university where you had a college team, you're going to be familiar with this term.</p>
<p id="p-44">And yeah, we're going to get into it today.</p>
<p id="p-45">So I am excited to talk about what Michelle today?</p>
<p id="p-46">Well, we're going to talk about how to share that you're a huge fan of a team or a school.</p>
<p id="p-47">Mostly those things.</p>
<p id="p-48">So this expression is going to be a this is a fun.</p>
<p id="p-49">It's kind of a gross sounding.</p>
<p id="p-50">It sounds a little disturbing, but it's not meant in this way.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-51">But it's not meant in this way.</p>
<p id="p-52">So yeah, the expression is I bleed color and color basically so yeah, you're When I mean we are taught we are basically saying I bleed these teams colors this school's colors And what does that mean?</p>
<p id="p-53">Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-54">What does yeah, we say I bleed these colors on me We'll just put it into context right away.</p>
<p id="p-55">Yeah So I think that my high school was actually sports were a bigger deal than my college because I went to a small college in Virginia and you know, but in high school, we had the high school football games and we were orange and black, right?</p>
<p id="p-56">So we were the Blackbirds And you say I bleed orange and black right with a grimacing look on your face like you're a big fan, right?</p>
<p id="p-57">You fully feel your team you believe in your team you stand for your team.</p>
<p id="p-58">Okay, right So you there is so much so that it's in your blood.</p>
<p id="p-59">It's who you are.</p>
<p id="p-60">Yeah so yeah, if</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-61">Yeah, So yeah, if you were to get a cut, the idea is that those are the colors that would come out because it's so true to who you are.</p>
<p id="p-62">And what about you, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-63">Knicks fan?</p>
<p id="p-64">What colors are the Knicks?</p>
<p id="p-65">Blue and orange?</p>
<p id="p-66">No.</p>
<p id="p-67">Blue and orange.</p>
<p id="p-68">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-69">Blue and orange.</p>
<p id="p-70">And actually, my high school was also blue and orange.</p>
<p id="p-71">So I always felt good about that.</p>
<p id="p-72">So I could say I bleed orange and blue or I bleed blue and orange.</p>
<p id="p-73">But you could be a Denver Broncos fan too, because I'm pretty sure the Denver Broncos also do orange and blue.</p>
<p id="p-74">Yeah, Oh, okay.</p>
<p id="p-75">Yeah, I mean, so Lindsay, but when would something like this come up?</p>
<p id="p-76">I mean, why?</p>
<p id="p-77">I mean, not out of nowhere, you're gonna say, I bleed orange and blue.</p>
<p id="p-78">When would this come up?</p>
<p id="p-79">This is all about not being tone deaf about knowing who you're around, right?</p>
<p id="p-80">This is about when you're around, you're a fanatic, you're a big fan, and you're around other big fans.</p>
<p id="p-81">This is when you would say this, right?</p>
<p id="p-82">You might say, I bleed orange and blue and then flex your muscles and whatever.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-83">And whatever, go tailgate with people, right?</p>
<p id="p-84">So this is not about saying this in a crazy way at work on Monday, if people, other people don't feel the same way.</p>
<p id="p-85">This is about who you're around in the moment.</p>
<p id="p-86">Right, Right, Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-87">So, you know, if it's just connecting with someone over sports and it, you know, it doesn't have to be professional sports.</p>
<p id="p-88">It could be college sports.</p>
<p id="p-89">It could also... College sports.</p>
<p id="p-90">Sorry, I was just gonna say, I think in the US, college sports are kind of people might prefer college football over pro football.</p>
<p id="p-91">A lot of people.</p>
<p id="p-92">It's just a little more interesting, I guess.</p>
<p id="p-93">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-94">Yeah, Yeah, So a lot of people really, really, really follow college sports.</p>
<p id="p-95">I mean, when I said my friend was watching the game the other day, he was watching his college's football game.</p>
<p id="p-96">So people really, really get into it over college sports.</p>
<p id="p-97">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-98">Or it could, if it's not about sports necessarily, it could just be your school in general.</p>
<p id="p-99">Maybe.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-100">in general, maybe all your family went to this one university.</p>
<p id="p-101">So it could be, you know, you know, you're a place you're fond of, like your college or university.</p>
<p id="p-102">It doesn't have to be about a sports team.</p>
<p id="p-103">It's more about showing pride for something.</p>
<p id="p-104">Totally.</p>
<p id="p-105">That's a really good point.</p>
<p id="p-106">And in that case, maybe it's other things you might say like go Blackbirds or for my high school, or I know for people that went to Notre Dame, they say like Irish or something like that.</p>
<p id="p-107">Right, I don't know exactly what they say.</p>
<p id="p-108">But anyways, there are certain code words, expressions that you might say to other fans.</p>
<p id="p-109">And especially if you're if you're your family's kind of a legacy at that school.</p>
<p id="p-110">Yeah, it's it's gonna be a big deal in your family if that's the kind of setup for right education.</p>
<p id="p-111">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-112">Right, Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-113">So, guys, we also want to take this time to thank those of you who have reviewed us because we appreciate you so much.</p>
<p id="p-114">So Lindsay wants to give a shout out to some listeners here today.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-115">a shout out to some listeners here today.</p>
<p id="p-116">I do.</p>
<p id="p-117">I would love to.</p>
<p id="p-118">I want to say thank you to Tunkay Goumas from Turkey who left us a five star review.</p>
<p id="p-119">And Ivana HC from the US also left us a five star review.</p>
<p id="p-120">And Ivana says, I have to say the new approach of releasing series on specific topics like the Olympics and politics is awesome.</p>
<p id="p-121">I love these topics.</p>
<p id="p-122">And they've helped me connect more deeply.</p>
<p id="p-123">Oh, that's great.</p>
<p id="p-124">That's great.</p>
<p id="p-125">Yeah, So special you to Tunkay and Ivana.</p>
<p id="p-126">And if you want to hear your name announced on the show, guys, go and leave us a review wherever you listen, whether it's in the podcast, Spotify, Apple, or in the iO Android app, leave us a review.</p>
<p id="p-127">Yeah, Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-128">Yes, Thank you so much.</p>
<p id="p-129">I'm so glad you like these, those series.</p>
<p id="p-130">And speaking of this isn't a series, but we have been just a couple episodes, episode 2301.</p>
<p id="p-131">We answered a listener question who was asking more for sports questions to talk about</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-132">sports questions, to talk about sports in English.</p>
<p id="p-133">So, we did episode 2301, Rookie Mistakes in English, and it's not necessarily a series, but we wanted to do another sports-type episode today.</p>
<p id="p-134">So, you'll start to notice we're going to potentially be doing a little bit more sports-related topics just because, to help this listener out, we're going to, and this is such a good connection topic.</p>
<p id="p-135">So, listen to that episode if you haven't yet.</p>
<p id="p-136">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-137">I'm so glad that our listeners are loving the show.</p>
<p id="p-138">So, Michelle, let's dive into some examples because that's how we show that real English.</p>
<p id="p-139">Yeah, Okay.</p>
<p id="p-140">Oh, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-141">I can't miss the game.</p>
<p id="p-142">It's my alma mater.</p>
<p id="p-143">I bleed red and yellow.</p>
<p id="p-144">I'm so glad you like the sweatshirt I got you.</p>
<p id="p-145">I know you bleed purple and yellow, so I couldn't resist.</p>
<p id="p-146">Sorry, that's not a role play.</p>
<p id="p-147">It was two separate examples.</p>
<p id="p-148">I'm clearly not listening to you.</p>
<p id="p-149">You bleed red and yellow, not purple and yellow.</p>
<p id="p-150">What am I even doing?</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-151">doing.</p>
<p id="p-152">Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-153">So yeah, in the first one, I'm saying it's so what is an alma mater?</p>
<p id="p-154">Yeah, all the modern to the important keyword.</p>
<p id="p-155">So this just means where you got your university degree as a your bachelor's degree.</p>
<p id="p-156">I don't think you would say that about your master's right?</p>
<p id="p-157">Not really.</p>
<p id="p-158">Or would you?</p>
<p id="p-159">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-160">I think so.</p>
<p id="p-161">I mean, you could say it about both then.</p>
<p id="p-162">Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p id="p-163">I mean, I have so Okay, sure.</p>
<p id="p-164">Why not?</p>
<p id="p-165">Yeah, So whenever you studied where you went to school, okay.</p>
<p id="p-166">Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-167">And then in the second example, you said I'm so glad you got like the sweatshirt.</p>
<p id="p-168">I know you bleed purple and yellow.</p>
<p id="p-169">So I couldn't resist.</p>
<p id="p-170">So what does that mean?</p>
<p id="p-171">And that's, oh, that's a fun episode idea.</p>
<p id="p-172">When somebody says I couldn't resist is a good one.</p>
<p id="p-173">Yeah, So again, guys, the mistake I made here, I thought this was a connected conversation.</p>
<p id="p-174">These are just two separate comments, right?</p>
<p id="p-175">Yeah, the second what I said, I'm so glad you like the sweatshirt.</p>
<p id="p-176">I know you bleed purple and yellow.</p>
<p id="p-177">So basically, I'm I probably just got you a logo sweatshirt of your school, which is</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-178">logo sweatshirt of your school, which is a different school, different logo colors, right?</p>
<p id="p-179">Purple and yellow.</p>
<p id="p-180">Yep, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-181">I mean, Lindsay, do you ever wear gear supporting sports teams or your alma mater?</p>
<p id="p-182">Do you have any of that?</p>
<p id="p-183">I guess when I went to school, I had like my school t-shirt.</p>
<p id="p-184">Not a ton of that, actually, unless I'm gifted something and it's a free t-shirt.</p>
<p id="p-185">I never turn down free t-shirts, you know, but no, I don't wear a lot of sports stuff.</p>
<p id="p-186">What about you?</p>
<p id="p-187">Nicks all the way.</p>
<p id="p-188">Yeah, I do.</p>
<p id="p-189">I do have Nick stuff.</p>
<p id="p-190">And now that we're we've moved a little bit, we have we're starting to get into some Eagles.</p>
<p id="p-191">OK, Sports gear.</p>
<p id="p-192">Philadelphia Eagles.</p>
<p id="p-193">Yes, Philadelphia Eagles.</p>
<p id="p-194">And but also just yesterday, I picked up what we got it delivered.</p>
<p id="p-195">It was because now my son is in elementary school and they had a fundraiser selling gear for the school.</p>
<p id="p-196">So I got a hoodie for this, you know, supporting the school.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-197">for this, you know, supporting the school.</p>
<p id="p-198">So it can even be I mean, I don't know that I would say about my son's elementary school that I bleed those colors.</p>
<p id="p-199">Yeah, right.</p>
<p id="p-200">But you know, just a way to Yeah, no, not that quite strong.</p>
<p id="p-201">I think it's nice.</p>
<p id="p-202">But yeah, just getting this gear can be can be fun.</p>
<p id="p-203">And you know, I have next up Dan actually just got shoes with next color.</p>
<p id="p-204">So it's just fun to get in the spirit.</p>
<p id="p-205">Well, I think there is something there like humans want to show that they're they're they're part of it.</p>
<p id="p-206">It's an identity.</p>
<p id="p-207">We want to show our identity, whether it's a Knicks fan, which says a lot about you, you're from New York, right?</p>
<p id="p-208">You're passionate, maybe, or any school organization, we want to show that identity sometimes, right?</p>
<p id="p-209">Not all the time, because sometimes we want to differentiate and not show it.</p>
<p id="p-210">Right, But yeah, so super interesting the way humans think.</p>
<p id="p-211">Yes, definitely.</p>
<p id="p-212">Isn't it frustrating when you can't express the nuances of your opinion?</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-213">express the nuances of your opinions, when you can't explain exactly what you mean, or when your English statements don't match the complexity of your thinking.</p>
<p id="p-214">We solve all of these problems in our new C1 Fluency course.</p>
<p id="p-215">It's live now and our special offer ends November 17th.</p>

<p id="p-218">See you there.</p>
<p id="p-219">All right, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-220">So there are other ways that we can say that we have pride for a team, a place, a school, a club, right?</p>
<p id="p-221">For example, yeah, I'm a lifelong something fan.</p>
<p id="p-222">Like I'm a lifelong Yankees fan.</p>
<p id="p-223">Right, Yeah, </p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-224">Right, Yeah, Or you could be more just descriptive.</p>
<p id="p-225">I've been a blank fan since blank.</p>
<p id="p-226">So I've been a fan of the Knicks since I was a little kid.</p>
<p id="p-227">Mm hmm.</p>
<p id="p-228">Right, And often these teams do go back to childhood for us.</p>
<p id="p-229">Right, Yeah, It associates it with going to games with our parents and things.</p>
<p id="p-230">So it's a big deal.</p>
<p id="p-231">It's a big part of our identity.</p>
<p id="p-232">I have a ton of X pride.</p>
<p id="p-233">I have a ton of Eagles pride.</p>
<p id="p-234">And of course, I can imagine our listeners will apply this to their own sports.</p>
<p id="p-235">I'm imagining soccer.</p>
<p id="p-236">Big deal.</p>
<p id="p-237">Yes, Globally, much bigger deal globally than it is here in the US.</p>
<p id="p-238">Right, So you could talk about your soccer team this way using these expressions.</p>
<p id="p-239">Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-240">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-241">So this is huge for connection.</p>
<p id="p-242">It is about your identity and especially like let's say your team is doing well or there's a big game coming up.</p>
<p id="p-243">You might even see if you live in the area where that team plays, you're going to see other people wearing their sports gear.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-244">their sports gear that shows their pride for that team.</p>
<p id="p-245">And so it can be a source of connection there as well.</p>
<p id="p-246">And then, you know, oh, oh my gosh, did you watch the game last night?</p>
<p id="p-247">Or people might even just say, if they see what you're wearing.</p>
<p id="p-248">I mean, sometimes if I see somebody with a Knicks shirt, I might just go, go Knicks, right?</p>
<p id="p-249">And you feel that connection.</p>
<p id="p-250">So it's just fun.</p>
<p id="p-251">Or even college, you know, I living in Denver, I hear a lot of go Buffs and Buffs are the mascot of Colorado University.</p>
<p id="p-252">Like Boulder, you know, University of Colorado Boulder, who by the way, right now, Dion Sanders is their coach.</p>
<p id="p-253">You know, Dion Sanders, the football player.</p>
<p id="p-254">I do know.</p>
<p id="p-255">Yeah, so they brought in a pro player, which has been interesting.</p>
<p id="p-256">So go Buffs, right?</p>
<p id="p-257">I hear people saying that even now, people in their forties saying that to each other who may have both gone to Colorado University.</p>
<p id="p-258">So yeah, interesting.</p>
<p id="p-259">Yeah, sports can really connect people together.</p>
<p id="p-260">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-261">So not a bad thing to learn about sports, know about it, even if it's not necessarily your thing.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-262">about it, even if it's not necessarily your thing, you know, you don't need to become a huge sports fan, but it's good to know about these things.</p>
<p id="p-263">Yeah, it's kind of nice when you can talk about anything with anyone, honestly, just have a little bit of basic knowledge of most things.</p>
<p id="p-264">It can go a long way for connection.</p>
<p id="p-265">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-266">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-267">Yes, Let's do a role play.</p>
<p id="p-268">All right.</p>
<p id="p-269">So we are strangers and we're sitting next to each other at a Knicks game.</p>
<p id="p-270">Of course.</p>
<p id="p-271">Yeah, Okay.</p>
<p id="p-272">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-273">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-274">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-275">Oh, your Jersey is so awesome.</p>
<p id="p-276">Oh, thanks.</p>
<p id="p-277">I bleed blue and orange, so I have so much gear.</p>
<p id="p-278">Oh, same.</p>
<p id="p-279">I've been a Knicks fan since the nineties.</p>
<p id="p-280">Oh, that's the best.</p>
<p id="p-281">I'm a lifelong fan for sure.</p>
<p id="p-282">I have a ton of Knicks pride.</p>
<p id="p-283">Let's get that championship.</p>
<p id="p-284">For sure.</p>
<p id="p-285">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-286">All right.</p>
<p id="p-287">So here you use the key phrase of the episode.</p>
<p id="p-288">I bleed blue and orange.</p>
<p id="p-289">Again, you're saying you're just a big Knicks fan, right?</p>
<p id="p-290">And then you're being very descriptive.</p>
<p id="p-291">I have been a Knicks fan since the nineties.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-292">a Knicks fan since the 90s.</p>
<p id="p-293">And then I said, I'm a lifelong fan.</p>
<p id="p-294">You said I'm a lifelong fan for sure.</p>
<p id="p-295">Yeah, And then you said I have a ton of Knicks pride.</p>
<p id="p-296">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-297">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-298">Yeah, I guess if I were going to be a fan of any team, it would probably be Boston Red Sox, but I just like to go for the beer and the hot dogs.</p>
<p id="p-299">That's okay.</p>
<p id="p-300">I don't care about the game.</p>
<p id="p-301">That's okay.</p>
<p id="p-302">But that's good.</p>
<p id="p-303">I mean, you can still, I don't think you have to be a huge, huge fan of the sport to care about the team or to like the experience.</p>
<p id="p-304">It's not that you need to know.</p>
<p id="p-305">Sometimes Dan will make fun of me if I'm trying to say I'm a fan of a team and he'll say, name three players on that team.</p>
<p id="p-306">He can't either.</p>
<p id="p-307">But yeah.</p>
<p id="p-308">And, and we, or we'll make up names.</p>
<p id="p-309">Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-310">But it's just fun to, it's just fun, especially, you know, if that team is in the playoffs or has a big game, it can be kind of fun to, to just be a part of the team spirit.</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p id="p-311">be a part of the team spirit.</p>
<p id="p-312">And I think I would encourage our listeners, guys, go to these games if you can, if you can get tickets, because there's nothing like that feeling in the summer when you're in a baseball stadium and someone cracks the bat, that sound of the bat cracking and you get it out, it goes into the stand and like the momentum, everyone stands up.</p>
<p id="p-313">It's the coolest feeling.</p>
<p id="p-314">It's almost like you get like a wave of energy up your whole body.</p>
<p id="p-315">It's very cool.</p>
<p id="p-316">It's very cool.</p>
<p id="p-317">So yeah, have those experiences as much as you can and connect at home when you're watching these games to talk about it the next day at a party, right?</p>
<p id="p-318">This is connection right here.</p>
<p id="p-319">Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-320">And guys, we did do speaking of series, we did do a whole series on basketball.</p>
<p id="p-321">So definitely head on over and I'm not listening to them all out.</p>
<p id="p-322">But part one is basketball in English part one vocabulary for the game.</p>
<p id="p-323">So lots of stuff for you guys to learn about sports here, basketball, talking about being a big fan.</p>
<p id="p-324">And yeah, anything else you want to add, Lindsay?</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p id="p-325">And yeah.</p>
<p id="p-326">Anything else you want to add, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-327">Yeah, I mean, the stuff of connection is right here in front of us, right?</p>
<p id="p-328">We don't need to think of these brilliant ideas to connect.</p>
<p id="p-329">All we have to do is think about who's in front of us.</p>
<p id="p-330">What do they care about?</p>
<p id="p-331">Be able to talk about it and genuinely be interested.</p>
<p id="p-332">That's connection right there.</p>
<p id="p-333">Right, Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-334">OK, Thank you so much, Lindsay, for talking about this with me today.</p>
<p id="p-335">And guys, have a good day.</p>
<p id="p-336">All right.</p>
