<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>see number one.</p>
<p>Hello, Michelle, how are you doing?</p>
<p>I'm good.</p>
<p>How are you, Lindsay?</p>
<p>Absolutely fantastic.</p>
<p>Michelle, do you know anyone who is a huge sports fan?</p>
<p>I know many people who are huge sports fans.</p>
<p>I have friends who are huge sports fans.</p>
<p>My nephew has turned into quite a huge sports fan.</p>
<p>Number one, he plays sports.</p>
<p>He's very athletic, which means that he's not from my family.</p>
<p>But number two, he knows a lot about sports.</p>
<p>Have you ever had this experience where you're friends with someone who is a huge sports fan and you're spending time with them and they're keep on checking the game?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>Yes, Yeah, I have friends who are like that, who they'll be sitting there watching.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>that who they'll be sitting there watching the game.</p>
<p>And I have even done that once before.</p>
<p>I remember last Mother's Day, there was a big Knicks game and I was just sitting watching the TV.</p>
<p>But I'm normally not like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, it can happen.</p>
<p>And this is timely because we're in the middle of football season, which is the most like sports.</p>
<p>I think there are just it's such a fanatic sport in America, in the United States of America.</p>
<p>People are just so into their football.</p>
<p>And people just go crazy.</p>
<p>Especially if you went to a big university where you had a college team, you're going to be familiar with this term.</p>
<p>And yeah, we're going to get into it today.</p>
<p>So I am excited to talk about what Michelle today?</p>
<p>Well, we're going to talk about how to share that you're a huge fan of a team or a school.</p>
<p>Mostly those things.</p>
<p>So this expression is going to be a this is a fun.</p>
<p>It's kind of a gross sounding.</p>
<p>It sounds a little disturbing, but it's not meant in this way.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>But it's not meant in this way.</p>
<p>So yeah, the expression is I bleed color and color basically so yeah, you're When I mean we are taught we are basically saying I bleed these teams colors this school's colors And what does that mean?</p>
<p>Lindsay?</p>
<p>What does yeah, we say I bleed these colors on me We'll just put it into context right away.</p>
<p>Yeah So I think that my high school was actually sports were a bigger deal than my college because I went to a small college in Virginia and you know, but in high school, we had the high school football games and we were orange and black, right?</p>
<p>So we were the Blackbirds And you say I bleed orange and black right with a grimacing look on your face like you're a big fan, right?</p>
<p>You fully feel your team you believe in your team you stand for your team.</p>
<p>Okay, right So you there is so much so that it's in your blood.</p>
<p>It's who you are.</p>
<p>Yeah so yeah, if</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>Yeah, So yeah, if you were to get a cut, the idea is that those are the colors that would come out because it's so true to who you are.</p>
<p>And what about you, Michelle?</p>
<p>Knicks fan?</p>
<p>What colors are the Knicks?</p>
<p>Blue and orange?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Blue and orange.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Blue and orange.</p>
<p>And actually, my high school was also blue and orange.</p>
<p>So I always felt good about that.</p>
<p>So I could say I bleed orange and blue or I bleed blue and orange.</p>
<p>But you could be a Denver Broncos fan too, because I'm pretty sure the Denver Broncos also do orange and blue.</p>
<p>Yeah, Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, so Lindsay, but when would something like this come up?</p>
<p>I mean, why?</p>
<p>I mean, not out of nowhere, you're gonna say, I bleed orange and blue.</p>
<p>When would this come up?</p>
<p>This is all about not being tone deaf about knowing who you're around, right?</p>
<p>This is about when you're around, you're a fanatic, you're a big fan, and you're around other big fans.</p>
<p>This is when you would say this, right?</p>
<p>You might say, I bleed orange and blue and then flex your muscles and whatever.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>And whatever, go tailgate with people, right?</p>
<p>So this is not about saying this in a crazy way at work on Monday, if people, other people don't feel the same way.</p>
<p>This is about who you're around in the moment.</p>
<p>Right, Right, Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>So, you know, if it's just connecting with someone over sports and it, you know, it doesn't have to be professional sports.</p>
<p>It could be college sports.</p>
<p>It could also... College sports.</p>
<p>Sorry, I was just gonna say, I think in the US, college sports are kind of people might prefer college football over pro football.</p>
<p>A lot of people.</p>
<p>It's just a little more interesting, I guess.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, So a lot of people really, really, really follow college sports.</p>
<p>I mean, when I said my friend was watching the game the other day, he was watching his college's football game.</p>
<p>So people really, really get into it over college sports.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Or it could, if it's not about sports necessarily, it could just be your school in general.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>in general, maybe all your family went to this one university.</p>
<p>So it could be, you know, you know, you're a place you're fond of, like your college or university.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be about a sports team.</p>
<p>It's more about showing pride for something.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>That's a really good point.</p>
<p>And in that case, maybe it's other things you might say like go Blackbirds or for my high school, or I know for people that went to Notre Dame, they say like Irish or something like that.</p>
<p>Right, I don't know exactly what they say.</p>
<p>But anyways, there are certain code words, expressions that you might say to other fans.</p>
<p>And especially if you're if you're your family's kind of a legacy at that school.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's it's gonna be a big deal in your family if that's the kind of setup for right education.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Right, Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>So, guys, we also want to take this time to thank those of you who have reviewed us because we appreciate you so much.</p>
<p>So Lindsay wants to give a shout out to some listeners here today.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>a shout out to some listeners here today.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I would love to.</p>
<p>I want to say thank you to Tunkay Goumas from Turkey who left us a five star review.</p>
<p>And Ivana HC from the US also left us a five star review.</p>
<p>And Ivana says, I have to say the new approach of releasing series on specific topics like the Olympics and politics is awesome.</p>
<p>I love these topics.</p>
<p>And they've helped me connect more deeply.</p>
<p>Oh, that's great.</p>
<p>That's great.</p>
<p>Yeah, So special you to Tunkay and Ivana.</p>
<p>And if you want to hear your name announced on the show, guys, go and leave us a review wherever you listen, whether it's in the podcast, Spotify, Apple, or in the iO Android app, leave us a review.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>Yes, Thank you so much.</p>
<p>I'm so glad you like these, those series.</p>
<p>And speaking of this isn't a series, but we have been just a couple episodes, episode 2301.</p>
<p>We answered a listener question who was asking more for sports questions to talk about</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>sports questions, to talk about sports in English.</p>
<p>So, we did episode 2301, Rookie Mistakes in English, and it's not necessarily a series, but we wanted to do another sports-type episode today.</p>
<p>So, you'll start to notice we're going to potentially be doing a little bit more sports-related topics just because, to help this listener out, we're going to, and this is such a good connection topic.</p>
<p>So, listen to that episode if you haven't yet.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I'm so glad that our listeners are loving the show.</p>
<p>So, Michelle, let's dive into some examples because that's how we show that real English.</p>
<p>Yeah, Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, here we go.</p>
<p>I can't miss the game.</p>
<p>It's my alma mater.</p>
<p>I bleed red and yellow.</p>
<p>I'm so glad you like the sweatshirt I got you.</p>
<p>I know you bleed purple and yellow, so I couldn't resist.</p>
<p>Sorry, that's not a role play.</p>
<p>It was two separate examples.</p>
<p>I'm clearly not listening to you.</p>
<p>You bleed red and yellow, not purple and yellow.</p>
<p>What am I even doing?</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>doing.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So yeah, in the first one, I'm saying it's so what is an alma mater?</p>
<p>Yeah, all the modern to the important keyword.</p>
<p>So this just means where you got your university degree as a your bachelor's degree.</p>
<p>I don't think you would say that about your master's right?</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>Or would you?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>I mean, you could say it about both then.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>I mean, I have so Okay, sure.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Yeah, So whenever you studied where you went to school, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And then in the second example, you said I'm so glad you got like the sweatshirt.</p>
<p>I know you bleed purple and yellow.</p>
<p>So I couldn't resist.</p>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>And that's, oh, that's a fun episode idea.</p>
<p>When somebody says I couldn't resist is a good one.</p>
<p>Yeah, So again, guys, the mistake I made here, I thought this was a connected conversation.</p>
<p>These are just two separate comments, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, the second what I said, I'm so glad you like the sweatshirt.</p>
<p>I know you bleed purple and yellow.</p>
<p>So basically, I'm I probably just got you a logo sweatshirt of your school, which is</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>logo sweatshirt of your school, which is a different school, different logo colors, right?</p>
<p>Purple and yellow.</p>
<p>Yep, exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, Lindsay, do you ever wear gear supporting sports teams or your alma mater?</p>
<p>Do you have any of that?</p>
<p>I guess when I went to school, I had like my school t-shirt.</p>
<p>Not a ton of that, actually, unless I'm gifted something and it's a free t-shirt.</p>
<p>I never turn down free t-shirts, you know, but no, I don't wear a lot of sports stuff.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>Nicks all the way.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do.</p>
<p>I do have Nick stuff.</p>
<p>And now that we're we've moved a little bit, we have we're starting to get into some Eagles.</p>
<p>OK, Sports gear.</p>
<p>Philadelphia Eagles.</p>
<p>Yes, Philadelphia Eagles.</p>
<p>And but also just yesterday, I picked up what we got it delivered.</p>
<p>It was because now my son is in elementary school and they had a fundraiser selling gear for the school.</p>
<p>So I got a hoodie for this, you know, supporting the school.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>for this, you know, supporting the school.</p>
<p>So it can even be I mean, I don't know that I would say about my son's elementary school that I bleed those colors.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>But you know, just a way to Yeah, no, not that quite strong.</p>
<p>I think it's nice.</p>
<p>But yeah, just getting this gear can be can be fun.</p>
<p>And you know, I have next up Dan actually just got shoes with next color.</p>
<p>So it's just fun to get in the spirit.</p>
<p>Well, I think there is something there like humans want to show that they're they're they're part of it.</p>
<p>It's an identity.</p>
<p>We want to show our identity, whether it's a Knicks fan, which says a lot about you, you're from New York, right?</p>
<p>You're passionate, maybe, or any school organization, we want to show that identity sometimes, right?</p>
<p>Not all the time, because sometimes we want to differentiate and not show it.</p>
<p>Right, But yeah, so super interesting the way humans think.</p>
<p>Yes, definitely.</p>
<p>Isn't it frustrating when you can't express the nuances of your opinion?</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>express the nuances of your opinions, when you can't explain exactly what you mean, or when your English statements don't match the complexity of your thinking.</p>
<p>We solve all of these problems in our new C1 Fluency course.</p>
<p>It's live now and our special offer ends November 17th.</p>
<p>Go to AllEarsEnglish.com slash C1 to save up to $100 and get a free $99 bonus course, Advanced Listening with Multiple Speakers.</p>
<p>Go to AllEarsEnglish.com slash C1.</p>
<p>See you there.</p>
<p>All right, Michelle.</p>
<p>So there are other ways that we can say that we have pride for a team, a place, a school, a club, right?</p>
<p>For example, yeah, I'm a lifelong something fan.</p>
<p>Like I'm a lifelong Yankees fan.</p>
<p>Right, Yeah, </p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>Right, Yeah, Or you could be more just descriptive.</p>
<p>I've been a blank fan since blank.</p>
<p>So I've been a fan of the Knicks since I was a little kid.</p>
<p>Mm hmm.</p>
<p>Right, And often these teams do go back to childhood for us.</p>
<p>Right, Yeah, It associates it with going to games with our parents and things.</p>
<p>So it's a big deal.</p>
<p>It's a big part of our identity.</p>
<p>I have a ton of X pride.</p>
<p>I have a ton of Eagles pride.</p>
<p>And of course, I can imagine our listeners will apply this to their own sports.</p>
<p>I'm imagining soccer.</p>
<p>Big deal.</p>
<p>Yes, Globally, much bigger deal globally than it is here in the US.</p>
<p>Right, So you could talk about your soccer team this way using these expressions.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So this is huge for connection.</p>
<p>It is about your identity and especially like let's say your team is doing well or there's a big game coming up.</p>
<p>You might even see if you live in the area where that team plays, you're going to see other people wearing their sports gear.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>their sports gear that shows their pride for that team.</p>
<p>And so it can be a source of connection there as well.</p>
<p>And then, you know, oh, oh my gosh, did you watch the game last night?</p>
<p>Or people might even just say, if they see what you're wearing.</p>
<p>I mean, sometimes if I see somebody with a Knicks shirt, I might just go, go Knicks, right?</p>
<p>And you feel that connection.</p>
<p>So it's just fun.</p>
<p>Or even college, you know, I living in Denver, I hear a lot of go Buffs and Buffs are the mascot of Colorado University.</p>
<p>Like Boulder, you know, University of Colorado Boulder, who by the way, right now, Dion Sanders is their coach.</p>
<p>You know, Dion Sanders, the football player.</p>
<p>I do know.</p>
<p>Yeah, so they brought in a pro player, which has been interesting.</p>
<p>So go Buffs, right?</p>
<p>I hear people saying that even now, people in their forties saying that to each other who may have both gone to Colorado University.</p>
<p>So yeah, interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, sports can really connect people together.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So not a bad thing to learn about sports, know about it, even if it's not necessarily your thing.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>about it, even if it's not necessarily your thing, you know, you don't need to become a huge sports fan, but it's good to know about these things.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's kind of nice when you can talk about anything with anyone, honestly, just have a little bit of basic knowledge of most things.</p>
<p>It can go a long way for connection.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yes, Let's do a role play.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So we are strangers and we're sitting next to each other at a Knicks game.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Yeah, Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Oh, your Jersey is so awesome.</p>
<p>Oh, thanks.</p>
<p>I bleed blue and orange, so I have so much gear.</p>
<p>Oh, same.</p>
<p>I've been a Knicks fan since the nineties.</p>
<p>Oh, that's the best.</p>
<p>I'm a lifelong fan for sure.</p>
<p>I have a ton of Knicks pride.</p>
<p>Let's get that championship.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So here you use the key phrase of the episode.</p>
<p>I bleed blue and orange.</p>
<p>Again, you're saying you're just a big Knicks fan, right?</p>
<p>And then you're being very descriptive.</p>
<p>I have been a Knicks fan since the nineties.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p>a Knicks fan since the 90s.</p>
<p>And then I said, I'm a lifelong fan.</p>
<p>You said I'm a lifelong fan for sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, And then you said I have a ton of Knicks pride.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess if I were going to be a fan of any team, it would probably be Boston Red Sox, but I just like to go for the beer and the hot dogs.</p>
<p>That's okay.</p>
<p>I don't care about the game.</p>
<p>That's okay.</p>
<p>But that's good.</p>
<p>I mean, you can still, I don't think you have to be a huge, huge fan of the sport to care about the team or to like the experience.</p>
<p>It's not that you need to know.</p>
<p>Sometimes Dan will make fun of me if I'm trying to say I'm a fan of a team and he'll say, name three players on that team.</p>
<p>He can't either.</p>
<p>But yeah.</p>
<p>And, and we, or we'll make up names.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>But it's just fun to, it's just fun, especially, you know, if that team is in the playoffs or has a big game, it can be kind of fun to, to just be a part of the team spirit.</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p>be a part of the team spirit.</p>
<p>And I think I would encourage our listeners, guys, go to these games if you can, if you can get tickets, because there's nothing like that feeling in the summer when you're in a baseball stadium and someone cracks the bat, that sound of the bat cracking and you get it out, it goes into the stand and like the momentum, everyone stands up.</p>
<p>It's the coolest feeling.</p>
<p>It's almost like you get like a wave of energy up your whole body.</p>
<p>It's very cool.</p>
<p>It's very cool.</p>
<p>So yeah, have those experiences as much as you can and connect at home when you're watching these games to talk about it the next day at a party, right?</p>
<p>This is connection right here.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>And guys, we did do speaking of series, we did do a whole series on basketball.</p>
<p>So definitely head on over and I'm not listening to them all out.</p>
<p>But part one is basketball in English part one vocabulary for the game.</p>
<p>So lots of stuff for you guys to learn about sports here, basketball, talking about being a big fan.</p>
<p>And yeah, anything else you want to add, Lindsay?</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p>And yeah.</p>
<p>Anything else you want to add, Lindsay?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, the stuff of connection is right here in front of us, right?</p>
<p>We don't need to think of these brilliant ideas to connect.</p>
<p>All we have to do is think about who's in front of us.</p>
<p>What do they care about?</p>
<p>Be able to talk about it and genuinely be interested.</p>
<p>That's connection right there.</p>
<p>Right, Absolutely.</p>
<p>OK, Thank you so much, Lindsay, for talking about this with me today.</p>
<p>And guys, have a good day.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Take care, Michelle.</p>
