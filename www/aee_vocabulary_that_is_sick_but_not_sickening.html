<p>Hello, Lindsay.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>Hey, Aubrey.</p>
<p>I'm feeling pretty good.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>So you're not sick.</p>
<p>When's the last time you were sick?</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>When's the last time you were sick?</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, sick.</p>
<p>I was sick in January.</p>
<p>I had to sit out a couple of episodes and wasn't feeling so great, but I'm recovered.</p>
<p>So I'm glad you're feeling better, feeling 100 percent.</p>
<p>Yeah, What about you?</p>
<p>Have you been sick lately?</p>
<p>No, it's been a long time since I can't even remember the last time I felt sick, luckily, because a year or more.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you know, it's when we recover from being sick is when we feel grateful for our health.</p>
<p>Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>We don't really appreciate it until we lose it.</p>
<p>It's so true.</p>
<p>Today we do have a great question from a listener talking about the word sick and sickening.</p>
<p>Right, All the different ways that we use this word.</p>
<p>Which we use them a lot of different ways in English.</p>
<p>So I'm excited to dive in.</p>
<p>Do you want me to read the question?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, please do.</p>
<p>This is from Mateus Proficio.</p>
<p>Hi, guys.</p>
<p>I was watching a TV show, a British one, and heard the expression, how you like them apples.</p>
<p>And in American movies, how about them apples?</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>And in American movies, how about them apples?</p>
<p>Both are used in the United States and can I throw them in a conversation?</p>
<p>Are they out of style?</p>
<p>There's also another one.</p>
<p>It's sickening, but by the context, it meant something good, I guess.</p>
<p>Is it okay to use this expression in a good way?</p>
<p>Thanks, love the show each day a lot more.</p>
<p>Oh, beautiful.</p>
<p>Mateos, thank you.</p>
<p>I know, right?</p>
<p>Amazing questions.</p>
<p>And we talked recently about this phrase, how do you like them apples?</p>
<p>So stay to the end.</p>
<p>We'll share that episode so you can go and listen to it for the answer to this first question.</p>
<p>And today we're going to dive into the second part of his question about is sickening?</p>
<p>Because we do sometimes use this positively.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm excited.</p>
<p>And how do you like them apples?</p>
<p>It's also a very important movie reference and you'll figure that out towards the end of the episode.</p>
<p>Yeah, you're going to hear about that in that episode.</p>
<p>That's good.</p>
<p>So I love that Mateos is asking this high level question because he's maybe heard native speakers take a word that seems</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>Native speakers take a word that seems negative, but is sometimes, occasionally in the right context, being used in a positive way.</p>
<p>That is super high level, right?</p>
<p>It is super high level and confusing because you will hear both.</p>
<p>You will hear sickening used to mean very negative and then also to mean extremely positive.</p>
<p>How confusing is that?</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>We have to pay attention to context.</p>
<p>And that's what we try to do here in All Ears English is teach you everything in the context of a conversation.</p>
<p>So shall we just dive right into it, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yeah, let's dive in.</p>
<p>So sickening is an adjective.</p>
<p>It can be used negatively to mean something is super disappointing or disgusting, right?</p>
<p>And for example, his behavior is sickening.</p>
<p>That means you find it appalling.</p>
<p>You think it is, you know, atrocious, despicable.</p>
<p>Disgusting, yes.</p>
<p>Sickening.</p>
<p>Yes, And maybe it makes you feel sick how bad it is, right?</p>
<p>Or that politician's actions are sickening.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>transactions are sickening, right?</p>
<p>We've all been there where we see someone doing things that are just unacceptable.</p>
<p>So we call them sickening.</p>
<p>I think I'm permanently sickened right now.</p>
<p>I'm sickened by everything that's going on.</p>
<p>So that's a side point.</p>
<p>But then there are moments when you can use it in a positive way, right?</p>
<p>So here's an example.</p>
<p>That couple is so in love, it's sickening.</p>
<p>Now, what is happening here, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Let's break this down.</p>
<p>Yeah, so maybe you see a couple embracing, kissing, and you might say this to a friend, especially if you're not in a relationship or you're a little bit bitter.</p>
<p>But really what you're saying is that it's beautiful.</p>
<p>Like, this is beautiful.</p>
<p>They're so in love.</p>
<p>It's actually extremely positive.</p>
<p>But we use this almost like slang to be kind of funny, be like, that is sickening.</p>
<p>That's so beautiful.</p>
<p>Or maybe like, that baby is so cute, it's sickening.</p>
<p>Those words that we like.</p>
<p>Sickening.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that's definitely</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>I think that's definitely a valid way to use it, especially when you want to be really emphatic.</p>
<p>And if you come back to another kind of physical response, let's say, I guess a lot of our listeners, if you've tasted American desserts, you might feel that they are sickening, right?</p>
<p>They're very sweet.</p>
<p>This is another important piece here, Aubrey.</p>
<p>Physically sickening.</p>
<p>Something is overly sweet or overly intense.</p>
<p>So I think that's kind of related to this idea of, oh, this couple in love, it's like the metaphorical version of overdoing it on sweetness or intensity.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Exactly, right?</p>
<p>And you can, any smell or there are a lot of things that you could find sickening, and you literally mean this is kind of making me sick to my stomach, like a dessert that's too sweet, a very strong smell that's noxious, right?</p>
<p>But we also use it, yeah, just like you said, that overly sweet feeling, sort of metaphorically for love or</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>It's kind of the love or babies.</p>
<p>Is there any kind of food that you find sickening, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Anything that most people like, but for you, it's just maybe too rich or too intense?</p>
<p>The only thing I find sickening is a food in the United States called sloppy joes.</p>
<p>Have you ever had sloppy joes?</p>
<p>We used to have that a lot as a kid.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Same.</p>
<p>And I hate them so much.</p>
<p>It's like hamburger with like red sauce and you just slop it on a bun.</p>
<p>I find it disgusting.</p>
<p>I find it sickening.</p>
<p>I don't know how anyone can eat it.</p>
<p>That's so funny.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>I was saying in another episode, I went to a steakhouse on Tuesday night and I ordered, I don't really eat steak, so I ordered gnocchi and it was an appetizer, but it was kind of sickening because it didn't have that great of a flavor, but it was just really creamy.</p>
<p>It must have been 5,000 calories on a plate.</p>
<p>Too rich.</p>
<p>Sickening.</p>
<p>After I had eaten three or four of them, it was sickening.</p>
<p>It was too much.</p>
<p>The other thing, just mentioning a steakhouse, if a steak</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>Just mentioning a steakhouse, if a steak is too rare or it's like bloody, I find that sickening too.</p>
<p>Like I get it, I don't want it overcooked, but I also don't want it bleeding on my plate.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So that's good.</p>
<p>So when you think about using that in a positive way, it's kind of the metaphorical version of how you feel when you eat sloppy joes or when I ate the gnocchi, right?</p>
<p>This is a good way to think of it, I think.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>And what's interesting, we're going to also share sicken and sick because sick we use positively a lot.</p>
<p>But first let's go over the verb sicken.</p>
<p>So the adjective is sickening, the verb is sicken.</p>
<p>So this is to make someone feel disgusted or appalled.</p>
<p>So all of these examples, you could change them a little and say, you know, her behavior sickens me.</p>
<p>I find it sickening, it sickens me.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Her behavior sickens me.</p>
<p>I think this might be a new usage for a lot of our listeners.</p>
<p>So I'm really excited for them to get this today and start using this.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>get this today and start using this, or politicians often sicken me with their actions or their rhetoric, right?</p>
<p>Yes, and in the same way, we can use this positively, just like sickening, to be like, oh, that couple is so cute kissing, it sickens me.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly, right, that's a good point too.</p>
<p>It can also be used in that positive way, and we're just saying it's a different reaction we're having.</p>
<p>It's too much, right?</p>
<p>Exactly, just using it as a verb instead of an adjective, but with the exact same meaning.</p>
<p>It's overly sickly sweet.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>And then, if this is in your personality, again, this is the cool thing about our listeners at their level, right?</p>
<p>They have a choice whether to use things that fit in their personality or maybe don't. I don't think this next way is in everyone's personality to say.</p>
<p>I don't think I would say this, but Aubrey, what is it?</p>
<p>We've really wound up with this.</p>
<p>This is sick as an adjective used positively.</p>
<p>It's slang to mean something</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>Literally, it's slang to mean something is cool or impressive.</p>
<p>It is, like you said, part of someone's personality, and you have to remember it means cool, like hip.</p>
<p>It can't just mean good, right?</p>
<p>You wouldn't be like, that TV is sick.</p>
<p>I really like it.</p>
<p>I bet it was expensive.</p>
<p>It has to be something that it's like a direct synonym for something being really cool, right?</p>
<p>Like her tattoos are sick.</p>
<p>I love them.</p>
<p>And you have to really drive it home with your intonation.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it won't work.</p>
<p>Your tattoos are sick.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>So her tattoos are sick.</p>
<p>I love them.</p>
<p>What else might we comment on?</p>
<p>Anything that's cool, like maybe there's a graffiti painting that you walk past.</p>
<p>You're like, that is sick.</p>
<p>Like you're commenting that it's impressive.</p>
<p>You think it's very cool.</p>
<p>Oh, that's so sick.</p>
<p>Or I could imagine like two dudes looking at their car engine, bringing up the hood.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, your engine is sick, right?</p>
<p>It's a special engine or I don't know.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>special engine or I don't know, something like that.</p>
<p>And this is, it's been around for a long time.</p>
<p>You might see it in a movie from the 50s, 60s, 70s.</p>
<p>Someone's like, oh, sick, man, that's so cool.</p>
<p>But we still hear it today.</p>
<p>I still hear people say sick.</p>
<p>Has it been around since the 50s?</p>
<p>That's so funny.</p>
<p>I thought it was sort of a new or a, I don't know, new thing.</p>
<p>But I'd have to look it up.</p>
<p>I feel like I've heard it forever, but it could be one of those things that's just permeated the culture so much that it feels like it's been around forever.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>I feel like you could have maybe heard it in Fast Times in Ridgemont High or something like that, like the 70s.</p>
<p>Yeah, that makes sense.</p>
<p>I bet that's about when it came about in the 70s.</p>
<p>Let's do a little mini role play here because often you'll use it to respond to something.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>So here we go.</p>
<p>Hey, I've started making graffiti art.</p>
<p>It's really fun.</p>
<p>Sick.</p>
<p>I want to see.</p>
<p>And I'm just saying cool.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Sick.</p>
<p>So that's why I'm saying this is not in my personality to say this.</p>
<p>It just wouldn't. It would feel too.</p>
<p>I would say if...</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>I would say it feels a little young when you hear this.</p>
<p>I'm going to say that.</p>
<p>And I think it is mostly younger people that use it.</p>
<p>Like you said, it doesn't mean you can't, but the intonation is really important.</p>
<p>What you're saying it about is really important.</p>
<p>You wouldn't use this for just anything.</p>
<p>It has to be something that really is pretty cool and unique.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Anything else we need to know here, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yeah, So like I had kind of mentioned before, be careful what you describe this about.</p>
<p>We would never say like, that symphony was sick.</p>
<p>The movie was sick, especially with that intonation, because of course, sick also means ill, like you are not feeling well.</p>
<p>And so if you don't use it about the right things and with the intonation, it could be extremely confusing.</p>
<p>Wait, you're sick?</p>
<p>You feel sick?</p>
<p>What's happening?</p>
<p>I mean, I think you could say that movie was sick.</p>
<p>You just have to deliver it the right way.</p>
<p>I mean, don't you think anything could be sick because it's in our view?</p>
<p>That was amazing.</p>
<p>That movie was sick.</p>
<p>Oh, you should have seen it.</p>
<p>You didn't see it?</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>You should have seen it.</p>
<p>You didn't see it?</p>
<p>Okay, maybe if it's like an action film, something you would call cool.</p>
<p>If it's like a romance, you would never call it sick, right?</p>
<p>Because you wouldn't call it cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, it has to be... I agree.</p>
<p>So certain genres, maybe a sci-fi movie or something.</p>
<p>Oh, this concept was sick, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, If you would call it cool, be like, oh, the effects were so cool.</p>
<p>You'd be like, the effects were so sick.</p>
<p>But if like a romance, even a romantic comedy, if you wouldn't call it cool, that romance is so cool.</p>
<p>No, you would never say that.</p>
<p>You might choose different words.</p>
<p>You might choose different words.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was so sweet or touching.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Heartfelt.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>All right, good.</p>
<p>Okay, Aubrey, let's bring it to life for our listeners.</p>
<p>So here we are friends and we're just chatting at lunchtime.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'll start us.</p>
<p>I love your wallet.</p>
<p>Is it new?</p>
<p>Yes, I found it on sale for an amazing price.</p>
<p>Sick, I love a good deal.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>a good deal.</p>
<p>Hey, have you spoken to Natalia?</p>
<p>She told me what her ex did.</p>
<p>Yes, I feel terrible for her.</p>
<p>What he did sickens me.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>The whole situation is sickening.</p>
<p>Let's get her a gift or flowers or something and see if she needs to talk.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>That's what good friends do, right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And we use them all here, I first.</p>
<p>And I wasn't saying the wallet was sick.</p>
<p>If it were really cool, I maybe could be like, sick wallet.</p>
<p>But I am talking about the deal.</p>
<p>Like, I love a good price, a good deal.</p>
<p>So I'm saying like, oh, that's cool.</p>
<p>You got a good deal.</p>
<p>Sick.</p>
<p>Yeah, interesting.</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>And then, oh yeah, I said, so it sounds like her ex did something really bad.</p>
<p>And then you said, yes, I feel terrible for her.</p>
<p>What he did sickens me.</p>
<p>And this is in a very negative way, right?</p>
<p>Exactly, right?</p>
<p>Whatever he's done, you know, he treated her poorly.</p>
<p>And so we're saying, I say what he did sickens me.</p>
<p>And then you say the whole situation is sickening, using that as an adjective.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>using that as an adjective, this is a negative way to use that, right?</p>
<p>Where it literally, we mean that it sickens us.</p>
<p>We feel sick because of what he did.</p>
<p>And I think anytime in English when we can create that imagery, right?</p>
<p>You're seeing something happening in front of you, whether it's something in the news or something that happened to your friend, and you're saying it's the equivalent of you feeling physically sick.</p>
<p>That's powerful, right?</p>
<p>And we maybe could have added here like, oh, they used to be such a cute couple.</p>
<p>It was sickening how adorable they were and how perfect they were for each other.</p>
<p>And then it would be the positive meaning.</p>
<p>No, that's a really good one.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>This is a really high level episode.</p>
<p>If you really think about it, guys, come back, listen again, and then start experimenting with one version, whether it's the positive sickening, the negative one, or the word sicken.</p>
<p>Also, try one of these, okay?</p>
<p>Yes, and thank you, Mateos, for this amazing question.</p>
<p>So interesting.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>amazing question, so interesting and we want to share where you can find the answer to the first part of his question.</p>
<p>It was All Ears English episode 2312.</p>
<p>So you could scroll up or you could come find it on our blog.</p>
<p>It was called Them's the Breaks, When to Throw Out Grammar Rules.</p>
<p>Actually, the best way to find an older episode, it's not that old, but get the app and then you can search the episode number on the app.</p>
<p>Yeah, go into the app, just go into the app store, type in All Ears English.</p>
<p>You can download the app for free.</p>
<p>You can listen for free to all the episodes and you'll be able to find the episodes much faster by using that search bar.</p>
<p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>And maybe our listeners need to go to that episode to find out where that quote is from.</p>
<p>Many of them already know, right?</p>
<p>If you don't, you don't want to miss out on that episode because it is a movie quote that has really permeated the culture we use it all the time.</p>
<p>And it breaks grammar rules.</p>
<p>So that episode gives you some details about when you can break grammar rules, expressions, what we use, like that, them's the breaks.</p>
<p>That's not grammatical.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p>That's not grammatical.</p>
<p>No, be aware, exactly.</p>
<p>Any takeaway for our listeners today?</p>
<p>I think we've, this has been high level.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Yes, it's very high level.</p>
<p>Words like sick and sickening are not just used to talk about being ill, right?</p>
<p>We want you to be able to use today's phrases to connect about something being cool or upsetting in English.</p>
<p>And we want you to be aware of these multiple meanings for words so that you're not confused when you hear them.</p>
<p>All right, sounds good.</p>
<p>Aubrey, I'll see you very soon in the next episode.</p>
<p>You have a good day.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>You too.</p>
<p>Thanks, Lindsay.</p>
<p>You too next time.</p>
