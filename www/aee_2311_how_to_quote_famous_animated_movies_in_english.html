<p>Hello Michelle.</p>
<p>Hey Michelle, question for you.</p>
<p>Yes, what is it?</p>
<p>Do you like animated movies?</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>animated movies?</p>
<p>You know, like Disney movies?</p>
<p>So I do.</p>
<p>I wouldn't say I'm... I love the Disney movies that I grew up with, you know.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>I have... Actually, my best friend, she is an animator and... Really?</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>So she is really into all of the movies and she knows all of them and I don't really as much.</p>
<p>I guess with my kids I'll get a little bit more into it.</p>
<p>But generally, I don't watch that much other than the old ones.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>Yeah, It reminds me of my childhood for sure.</p>
<p>But there's still... Even as an adult, there's still some good... Like the movie Inside Out.</p>
<p>I remember watching that recent... I think that's animated.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm pretty sure it is.</p>
<p>Yeah, I remember watching that on a plane just in the last five years and bawling.</p>
<p>That means crying.</p>
<p>I can't... I know.</p>
<p>I've seen some of Inside Out, but I can't pay attention to it because it's one...</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>pay attention to it because it's what I again, I'm not good with the coming of age.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, too emotional.</p>
<p>That's, that's really about me.</p>
<p>That's a fun fact is my my biggest thing is just time going by too fast.</p>
<p>And so when there's anything like that, it's it's it's so painful for me.</p>
<p>I can't I can't even watch those things.</p>
<p>So okay, well, everyone has their own triggers, right?</p>
<p>The things that we like to avoid for sure.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I get it.</p>
<p>Also sad dog movies.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no, no, no, like old yeller, old yeller.</p>
<p>I could just broke my heart when I was a kid.</p>
<p>I did not watch it again.</p>
<p>No, no, exactly.</p>
<p>So what are we getting into Michelle today?</p>
<p>Before we get into it, I just want to let our listeners know we like to do these fun Spotify polls.</p>
<p>Yeah, So at the towards the end of this episode, we are going to put in a Spotify poll.</p>
<p>It's a great way to interact with us.</p>
<p>So we get to see what you guys are thinking.</p>
<p>And then we will</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>to see what you guys are thinking, and then we will announce the results on a future episode.</p>
<p>Excellent, excellent.</p>
<p>And today, we're going to answer a listener question.</p>
<p>We're going to talk about Disney movies, about animated movies.</p>
<p>They're not all Disney, I guess.</p>
<p>Animated movies, Pixar and different brands are emerging, for sure.</p>
<p>But we'll talk about those and some famous quotes.</p>
<p>But first, I do want to, Michelle, say a special thank you to certain special listeners that went ahead and left us a review.</p>
<p>You guys took the time to go to wherever you're listening, the app or Apple Podcasts, and write a review for the show.</p>
<p>And I see some five-star reviews here, Michelle.</p>
<p>Ooh, yay.</p>
<p>Yes, a special thank you to me, Edison, from Taiwan.</p>
<p>There was an anonymous five-star review.</p>
<p>We love those, too, on October 26.</p>
<p>And merrybaby135 from Japan.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, guys, for reviewing the show.</p>
<p>We love it, and we are going to try to announce your name on the show.</p>
<p>You go and review the show, guys, so go leave a review.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>the show guys so go leave a review whether you're in the iOS Android app that's a good place to listen or whether you're an Apple podcast or Spotify or any other place you get your podcasts okay yeah absolutely thank you guys so much before we get started and read the listener question Lindsay do you have a favorite animated movie wow that's a hard question yeah I really like Lion King I think Lion King is the kind of one that I liked more when I saw it later in life actually believe it or not and I saw it on Broadway too which was amazing oh you guys wanted to do that oh yeah I've heard it's incredible I love I like Sleeping Beauty um I like Beauty and the Beast I love Lion King I mean I remember every day after school coming home and sitting with my brother and we would watch the Lion King that was our favorite one I remember I had I had a we had two little neon chairs I had an orange one and he had a green one and I still remember that but Little Mermaid was the first movie that I ever saw in the theater okay</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>the first movie that I ever saw in the theater.</p>
<p>OK, Yeah, that was a big one, too, in my childhood.</p>
<p>Just hearing you describe these moments with your brother makes me think that this, what our listeners are going to learn today, is going to be powerful.</p>
<p>Because for a lot of our listeners, if you guys are in your 30s, 40s, maybe 50s, or even 20s, when you quote lines from these movies, it sends the person back to the movie, which sends them back to usually good feelings about childhood, and experiences, and good memories, right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>There's a lot.</p>
<p>Because as adults, if we talk about these, we share these movies, it's generally probably something that you watched when you were a kid, of course, depending on how old you are.</p>
<p>But yeah, thinking about Beauty and the Beast, I mean, yeah, for each of these movies, I can talk about why I like them, and a memory I have with them.</p>
<p>And these animated films are kind of special in that way.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I'm so excited to get deeper into this episode today.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>So to get deeper into this episode today, I'm going to read the listener question.</p>
<p>Shall I, Michelle?</p>
<p>Go ahead and read it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So did this come from YouTube?</p>
<p>We don't know.</p>
<p>We don't know where this came from, but that's okay.</p>
<p>I'm not sure.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So the listener says, Hi, Lindsay and Michelle, I'm Sophia.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your amazing podcast.</p>
<p>I really enjoy listening to it and have learned so much from both of you.</p>
<p>That is so nice.</p>
<p>Thank you, Sophia.</p>
<p>I have a quick question about the phrase, be my guest.</p>
<p>Could you explain how to use it in conversation?</p>
<p>Use in advance.</p>
<p>Yeah, Okay.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Sophia, this is an awesome question.</p>
<p>I love this question.</p>
<p>So we actually, over six years ago, talked about this expression.</p>
<p>So of course you want to know that it was covered, but I did, I thought, Oh, I recognize this.</p>
<p>I think I did this.</p>
<p>So episode 985, that was be our guest.</p>
<p>When should you use this phrase?</p>
<p>So definitely guys go over and listen to that one.</p>
<p>Not just to give, to answer Sophia's question.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>To answer Sophia's question, Be My Guest could be used in a genuine or a sarcastic way.</p>
<p>So we'll give a couple of examples and then we're going to go into something inspired by this question.</p>
<p>So Lindsay, what's an example?</p>
<p>Yes, So Be My Guest could be used, like we said, a genuine or a sarcastic way, as you said.</p>
<p>So if you're cold, please be my guest.</p>
<p>Take a blanket from the drawer over there, right?</p>
<p>So when you're hosting someone, it's a way of showing people that they should help themselves or make themselves comfortable.</p>
<p>It's like, you know, make yourself at home.</p>
<p>That idea.</p>
<p>Yes, Yes, Or if you don't want to be the one, no, if you if you want to be the one to tell her the bad news, be my guest.</p>
<p>That's a little more sarcastic, right?</p>
<p>Yes, A little more with an attitude.</p>
<p>Yes, Yes, Or I don't want to argue with you, but sounds like you want to argue.</p>
<p>Be my guest.</p>
<p>OK, So it's welcoming someone in a certain way.</p>
<p>But whether that way.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>in a certain way, but whether that way is a good way or kind of a snarky way, that depends on the context.</p>
<p>So definitely head over to that episode 985 because we really get deep into it on that one.</p>
<p>But so, Lindsay, today I thought we would do a spin on this question.</p>
<p>So when I hear Be My Guest, I think of Be Our Guest, which is from what movie, Lindsay?</p>
<p>The Beauty and the Beast.</p>
<p>I almost start in my head.</p>
<p>I start the tune starting.</p>
<p>Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Now I'm going to have it stuck in my head all day.</p>
<p>I think it was Lumiere who sings lead on this one.</p>
<p>It's when in Beauty and the Beast, they're all, you know, she doesn't want to go to dinner, I think, because of the Beast.</p>
<p>And then they all put on a big show for her.</p>
<p>And it's just it's this extremely special moment in the movie.</p>
<p>It's a very cheerful song if you don't know it.</p>
<p>Definitely go and listen to it.</p>
<p>It's that's another great movie.</p>
<p>It must have been amazing writing these movies, you know, writing these scripts and orchestrating those moments in.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>Demonstrating those moments in and just like the music bringing it all together.</p>
<p>What a cool career.</p>
<p>That would be.</p>
<p>Yeah Oh my gosh for sure.</p>
<p>So yeah, that's be my guest.</p>
<p>That's what it really makes me think of that's amazing scene So we're gonna talk about expressions from animated films or maybe the song titles that you may hear in everyday life So it's not that be my guest comes from the movie I think it exists on as an expression on its own, but I think When you hear it, it's hard not to think of beauty and the beast.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>No ingrained in our culture Yeah, that's an important point Michelle.</p>
<p>We already had that expression I'm sure we did I'm sure in the English language and we knew what it meant and we would deploy it and use it But then the movie used grabbed it and then now we think of it as the movie, right?</p>
<p>Right, It's interesting how that change It's hard.</p>
<p>It's hard to hear that without thinking of It's hard to say be my guess, you know, even if you're angry and you say be my guest</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>And you say, be my guest, and then somebody might just in their head think, oh, yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>So I'm excited to get into these, Michelle, we're going to go into what are these?</p>
<p>I think we have four of them from one famous movie or five of them.</p>
<p>So let's get right into it.</p>
<p>I bet our listeners are wondering which ones are going to highlight me.</p>
<p>Yes, Okay, so the first one is just keep swimming.</p>
<p>So do you know this one, Lindsay?</p>
<p>Yeah, I you know what?</p>
<p>So Finding Nemo is a movie that I only saw more recently.</p>
<p>So it's not internalized as much for me as these older ones are.</p>
<p>Yeah, So that's funny.</p>
<p>I also saw it recently for the first time.</p>
<p>So but I knew even I mean, I had seen bits and pieces.</p>
<p>But I even though I hadn't seen it, I knew the expression.</p>
<p>I knew it was fun just because people would always say it.</p>
<p>And huh, yep.</p>
<p>Yeah, So I mean, this basically means just keep moving on with your life.</p>
<p>I don't remember exactly where it was used in the movie, but it</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>where it was used in the movie.</p>
<p>But, you know, it's it's the idea it's used about fish, but it's teaching this moral lesson of move on with your life, even though it can be tough.</p>
<p>It's kind of like saying, hang in there or hang on.</p>
<p>Yeah, So would this be something where you'd say maybe if someone's going through a breakup, potentially, depending on their mood or.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, You want to.</p>
<p>This is definitely very cute sounding.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I think you save it when, you know, the person is in an OK enough mood to maybe not the day after a breakup.</p>
<p>So maybe well into that time.</p>
<p>Yeah, Maybe.</p>
<p>Yeah, Like maybe.</p>
<p>OK, maybe it's well after their breakup and they're getting into dating again and they're saying it's like so.</p>
<p>And then you might say, OK, come on, just keep swimming.</p>
<p>You can do this.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, Or maybe they've had a couple of disappointing first dates and you're trying to encourage them to get back out there and book another date.</p>
<p>Right, OK, Yes, I love that.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>Yes, I love that.</p>
<p>Yes, Exactly.</p>
<p>So the next one is from The Lion King, Lindsay, which we both love.</p>
<p>So what is this?</p>
<p>Hakuna Matata.</p>
<p>Right, So this one so famous, especially with our generation, millennials, maybe Gen X. This comes from The Lion King, of course.</p>
<p>Yes, And it means no worries, I guess, in Swahili.</p>
<p>I don't speak Swahili, so I can't speak to that.</p>
<p>But that's what we looked up.</p>
<p>Right, That's what.</p>
<p>Yes, So the movie was based in Africa, right, I imagine.</p>
<p>And how would we use this, Michelle?</p>
<p>Right, So you could say something like, I know you're worried about your schedule this month, but like Timon and Pumbaa say, Hakuna Matata.</p>
<p>You got this.</p>
<p>Oh, I always think that the names from The Lion King would make great dog's names, you know.</p>
<p>Oh, that is so cute.</p>
<p>Pumbaa.</p>
<p>Pumbaa.</p>
<p>That is cute.</p>
<p>Pumbaa the dog.</p>
<p>That's adorable.</p>
<p>So cute.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>And we'll be right back for three more phrases.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>Three more phrases.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay, Michelle, we're back.</p>
<p>So what is the next one?</p>
<p>Now we're going like 20 years forward.</p>
<p>Yeah, the timeline.</p>
<p>We're going into the future.</p>
<p>Yes, So this one is, I looked this one up, to be honest, because I haven't seen Frozen, but I have to.</p>
<p>I mean, it's so popular.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, of course you could do, you could say, let it go from Frozen.</p>
<p>That's one.</p>
<p>But I found this one, which I thought was interesting, is some people are worth melting for.</p>
<p>Oh, beautiful.</p>
<p>Do you remember this, Lindsay?</p>
<p>Oh, beautiful.</p>
<p>Do you remember this?</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>Oh, beautiful.</p>
<p>Do you remember this, Lindsay?</p>
<p>I don't remember that moment.</p>
<p>Was that set by the snowman?</p>
<p>Yeah, Yes, What's his name?</p>
<p>I can't remember his name.</p>
<p>Oh, Olaf.</p>
<p>Olaf.</p>
<p>Yes, Frozen is one of those movies that even if you don't know it, you know the names of Elsa, Anna, Olaf, and you know, you can't get away from it.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>I mean, my niece was so into this for a few years.</p>
<p>She couldn't stop talking about Elsa and Anna, right?</p>
<p>All the characters, Olaf, oh my gosh.</p>
<p>So it's basically the idea, what we're conveying here is we can sacrifice ourselves for some people, right?</p>
<p>They're worth it.</p>
<p>They're worth it.</p>
<p>So what would be a sample sentence?</p>
<p>You could say something like, oh, okay, I'll be the one to share the bad news.</p>
<p>You just relax.</p>
<p>You're worth melting for.</p>
<p>It's like... Yeah, that's interesting.</p>
<p>Because apparently... Lindsay, I don't know.</p>
<p>Maybe you know better than I do, but apparently maybe... I don't want to give away things from the movie, but something about Olaf melting.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>But something about Olaf melting, I don't know what I want to say.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yes, Do you remember?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I'm not close enough to the story to... I just kind of watched it with my niece and you know what I mean?</p>
<p>So yes.</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of these stories can have sad endings at times, right?</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>So this idea is, okay, I'm going to share this news with you because it's worth it.</p>
<p>You know, being honest with you, is that what we're kind of saying?</p>
<p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>Maybe sacrifice... Maybe sacrificing yourself, you know, maybe, you know, you're like, I'm doing something bad to myself for you.</p>
<p>That's how I take it.</p>
<p>If we have any Frozen fans who want to add that, if you want to correct me, but that's how I understood it.</p>
<p>It's a nice line though.</p>
<p>It's really... It is nice.</p>
<p>I could see people, I don't know, using that in wedding vows if they're really big Disney fans or something.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, It's a nice line.</p>
<p>It's kind of romantic, I think.</p>
<p>Right, Yeah, It's a nice line.</p>
<p>Yeah, </p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p>thought too until I looked into I think how it was used in the movie and then I thought oh wait I don't know maybe not maybe definitely look into this before you put it into your wedding yeah make sure you know the context a bunch of angry brides yeah and that actually is important right because often when we're using these lines in our lives we are referring back to the context of the movie and we're not really changing the meaning of the phrase and applying it to a different scenario wouldn't you say Michelle right right exactly yeah it is really a reference to the movie I think mm-hmm 100% yeah okay what's the next one okay yeah so this is Toy Story so it's to infinity and beyond yeah and a Toy Story is another example of I can only watch the first one and they get sadder and sadder as time goes on I think especially the third one they say is so sad</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p>The third one, they say, is so sad with the going to college and, oh, I can't do it.</p>
<p>So but you know this expression, Lindsay, right?</p>
<p>Yes, Yes, This one is definitely in the cultural, you know, in our narrative culturally.</p>
<p>Right, And then going back to Aladdin, going back another 25 years again.</p>
<p>This one is one that I grew up with, Aladdin, for sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, Oh, I love Aladdin.</p>
<p>Yeah, This was one of the first big, big Disney movies, I think.</p>
<p>I mean, there were bigger ones before in the 70s, but when Disney really came about in the 80s and 90s and just kind of exploded.</p>
<p>Right, Yep.</p>
<p>Yeah, So this is A Whole New World.</p>
<p>Now, so this is come this is the there's a song called A Whole New World in Aladdin.</p>
<p>And so you can you can use it to talk about a change or a difference or maybe a bit of magic.</p>
<p>And it's not just from Aladdin.</p>
<p>This comes from other places as well.</p>
<p>If you if you reference it, people will like.</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p>it, people will likely think of Aladdin.</p>
<p>So you could say it's a whole new world out there.</p>
<p>Yes, I like that.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>And that one also could come.</p>
<p>I mean, there's the Brave New World, which comes from the book, right?</p>
<p>I mean, that's also so that one could have a that one might not be as straightforward.</p>
<p>I've heard it in different contexts in different ways.</p>
<p>So yeah, but yeah, Aladdin.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>Yeah, Oh, great movie.</p>
<p>Great movie.</p>
<p>So Lindsay, we've talked about making pop culture references before.</p>
<p>And this is a great start for animated films.</p>
<p>So I tried to choose some of the more famous ones, and ones that have stood the test of time.</p>
<p>Lindsay, what does that mean?</p>
<p>If it's stood the test of time?</p>
<p>That's a great question.</p>
<p>It's dirt.</p>
<p>It's been durable.</p>
<p>It means that the phrase hasn't been canceled in any way, right?</p>
<p>Like deemed kind of sexist or racist.</p>
<p>And you know, it's lasted like it's still applied.</p>
<p>It's still relevant.</p>
<p>In 2024, as relevant</p>
<h2>Part-21</h2>
<p>in 2024, as relevant as it was in 1994.</p>
<p>Right, Right, Yes, Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>And I do think Broadway helps in that way.</p>
<p>I mean, because there is Aladdin on Broadway.</p>
<p>There's, you know, Beauty and the Beast has been on a lot of these.</p>
<p>I mean, I think even Frozen, certainly The Lion King.</p>
<p>So I think a lot of those help keep these alive as well.</p>
<p>And then they've even made new versions of Beauty and the Beast.</p>
<p>Yeah, they call it the live action version, Beauty and the Beast and Little Mermaid and and Aladdin.</p>
<p>So a lot of these have new versions, updated versions.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's interesting for sure.</p>
<p>And if you have a chance to see any of these on Broadway, definitely recommend it for sure.</p>
<p>So, Michelle, let's do a quick role play.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Let's dive into it.</p>
<p>Bring these phrases into action.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>So we are friends getting to the airport to go on a friend's vacation.</p>
<p>OK, fine.</p>
<p>This is going to be the best.</p>
<p>I'm actually excited to get to the terminal.</p>
<p>I hear it's a whole new world in there.</p>
<p>Same.</p>
<p>Let's get something to eat.</p>
<h2>Part-22</h2>
<p>there.</p>
<p>Same.</p>
<p>Let's get something to eat.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>Look at that line.</p>
<p>Oh, it's okay, Lindsay.</p>
<p>Just keep swimming.</p>
<p>We have plenty of time.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>Hakuna Matata.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>One of us needs to call the hotel.</p>
<p>I really don't want to.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Some people are worth melting for.</p>
<p>Thanks, Lindsay.</p>
<p>To infinity and beyond.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I think this is a little bit intense, right?</p>
<p>Of course, we're not going to.</p>
<p>Yes, This is quite a conversation.</p>
<p>Although, although sometimes people might like to have a little competition.</p>
<p>Oh, you used it.</p>
<p>You used an animated one.</p>
<p>I'm going to use one.</p>
<p>You use it.</p>
<p>Right, Yeah, So it is possible.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Right, So we've talked about that on the show where someone might drop a certain kind of line like from Seinfeld.</p>
<p>And then the response is someone drops another line from Seinfeld.</p>
<p>It's like matching themes, right?</p>
<p>With each other.</p>
<p>And if you're</p>
<h2>Part-23</h2>
<p>Right, With each other.</p>
<p>And if you're able to do that, it's really, really, really, it's a C2 native, even a lot of native speakers can't do it, honestly.</p>
<p>So it's pretty good.</p>
<p>Yeah, So that's what the vibe that we're going for here.</p>
<p>Yeah, So, Michelle, what did you say?</p>
<p>I said, I'm actually excited to get to the terminal.</p>
<p>But, Lindsay, have you ever been to, you know, a terminal at the airport and you heard that they redid it or it's really nice now?</p>
<p>Yeah, LaGuardia, I think.</p>
<p>Didn't they redo parts of LaGuardia terminal?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't know, but I know Newark has one terminal.</p>
<p>I think it's terminal C. I don't know.</p>
<p>But I love it.</p>
<p>Is it nice?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I mean, it's not that nice, but for an airport, I think it's nice.</p>
<p>So and then I said, it's a whole new world in there.</p>
<p>It's a whole new world.</p>
<p>So meaning it looks very different from renovations and it adds a sense of magic, what you're saying here.</p>
<p>Right, Yeah, Yeah, Because we're invoking Disney.</p>
<p>And then you said, it's okay, Lindsay, just keep swimming.</p>
<p>We have plenty of time.</p>
<p>Right, We have plenty of time.</p>
<h2>Part-24</h2>
<p>Right, I'm saying all the lines so long and then you encourage me just keep walking Do the thing you need to do drop off your bag check in just keep taking action.</p>
<p>Yes, Yes, exactly and you said Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You're right Hakuna.</p>
<p>Matata.</p>
<p>So you're saying no worries.</p>
<p>We you know, we're good Yeah, and then you said oh no, none of us one of us needs to call the hotel.</p>
<p>I really don't want to And so you said okay some people are worth melting for so you're saying, you know I value your friendship and I'll it's it's to me if I understand correctly It's kind of like I'll take one for the team.</p>
<p>Yeah, there's another good.</p>
<p>We could do a whole episode about that Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And then and then I say thanks you say, thanks, Lindsay And then I say to infinity and beyond let's go and this one is the most Animated I guess and again, I also want to emphasize that You know, you kind of need to feel this when you if you're gonna do especially with this last line</p>
<h2>Part-25</h2>
<p>to do, especially with this last line, you're really just full on quoting the movie, right?</p>
<p>It works for certain personalities.</p>
<p>And maybe other personalities wouldn't feel like doing like, it's just not you.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So you kind of need to know yourself.</p>
<p>Would you say so, Michelle?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>I wouldn't force this.</p>
<p>Yeah, don't force it.</p>
<p>Yeah, But I would say this is for maybe if you if you want to be a little larger than life in that moment.</p>
<p>just really be extremely animated.</p>
<p>Then you go for it.</p>
<p>But this is not something where you say, okay, really need to figure out how to fit this one in to be to connect.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, no, you know, you can choose some of the ones that are a little bit more natural that we've talked about today.</p>
<p>This is way this is a way of sprinkling in your personality.</p>
<p>And if you resonated with that particular movie, you know, the people you're talking to did or just Disney in general, then yes, use it.</p>
<p>But just make sure it's a fit for you.</p>
<p>Because it is very animated.</p>
<p>It's very, I would say someone who's really, I don't know, really animated.</p>
<h2>Part-26</h2>
<p>I don't know really animated in their personality would use that in a certain way playful Maybe very playful.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe someone that is On Broadway a Broadway actor or something where they're an actor and they're always kind of bringing that into their lives Right, right.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So very good and Let's ask the Spotify question.</p>
<p>We were talking about.</p>
<p>So Lindsay, what is the question?</p>
<p>The question is do you like to watch animated movies?</p>
<p>And again, it's not just Disney There are other brands that make these now, but do you like to watch this kind of movie or do you prefer non animated movies?</p>
<p>Yes, or no, so go and vote guys vote make your voice heard if you want to see what you think what you do Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>And just to recommend another Examples another episode because we were talking about the airport episode 2297 was traveling soon English phrases for the airport.</p>
<p>All right, what's a takeaway for our listeners today, Michelle?</p>
<p>What would you say?</p>
<h2>Part-27</h2>
<p>Michelle, what would you say?</p>
<p>Um, you know, don't force these expressions.</p>
<p>Don't force them in, but choose one that feels right to you, one that you know well.</p>
<p>And also just talking about this topic is really fun because it makes people feel nostalgic, want to share stories from their childhood.</p>
<p>So it's just a great connection topic.</p>
<p>Yes, All right.</p>
