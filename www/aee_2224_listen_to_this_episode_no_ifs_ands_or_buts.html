<p>How can you do it? Use this common little phrase in a few different scenarios to make your point heard.</p>
<p>Find out what it is today.</p>
<p>Hello, Lindsay.</p>
<p>How are you? Hey, Michelle, I'm doing excellent today.</p>
<p>How's everything in your world? Everything is good, everything is good, Lindsay.</p>
<p>Do you ever have to make an excuse for something that you can't do? Maybe you can't go somewhere, you can't attend an event.</p>
<p>Are you comfortable saying you can't do something? Yeah, I mean, just last night I had to cancel on my meditation group because I'm a little sick.</p>
<p>Actually, I have a little bit of a cold and I didn't want to be in that small group in someone's home coughing and then people look at you like, why did you come? Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That was, that was really smart.</p>
<p>Yeah, I felt a little bit awkward there but it's kind of common for people to cancel in that group.</p>
<p>Actually, it kind of depends on the context, like how common is it for people to bow out of things.</p>
<p>So that's a good one.</p>
<p>But in life, I want to show up, you know.</p>
<p>So if I can't go somewhere do something.</p>
<p>Yeah, there's a little discomfort letting people down, you know.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>Well, today we are actually going to talk about a way to say something must happen, right? So even if you have excuse whatever it is, something must happen before we get into that.</p>
<p>We want to share some key poll results guys, we've been doing these really fun Spotify, key polls, we ask a question and our listeners can interact with us.</p>
<p>So episode 2188 of the All Ears English podcast, that was the same name, how to connect over this commonality.</p>
<p>And the question was, do you like your name? Lindsay? What are the results? Could you share the results are interesting.</p>
<p>Very positive.</p>
<p>So 83% of you guys do like your name.</p>
<p>That's interesting.</p>
<p>And 17% don't like your name.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>OK, I feel good that people are happy with their names and everything's good.</p>
<p>Yes, that is good.</p>
<p>That is good.</p>
<p>Um OK, so let's get into it.</p>
<p>What is this expression that we're going to be sharing today? This is a fun one.</p>
<p>Very common.</p>
<p>The expression is no ifs ands or buts and I think I also, I've heard another variation of it which is no ifs ands or buts about it.</p>
<p>Oh Have you heard that one? Michelle? That extension? No.</p>
<p>Um Maybe.</p>
<p>Oh wait, uh uh maybe but not as it's possible.</p>
<p>I've heard it before but not something that came to my head.</p>
<p>OK, Got it.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Tell us about this expression.</p>
<p>Well, this is a funny one.</p>
<p>It's, it's a little bit of a little bit childish sounding or little juvenile sounding, but it's used by adults as well, especially maybe to talk to Children.</p>
<p>Right? So, but it means it's this idea that someone can't respond with an excuse or a different opinion.</p>
<p>Really? So the idea is you can't say ifs, right.</p>
<p>No, ifs, you can't say well, if this happened, you can't say and you can't say and they can't come, you can't say but, but I have something that day, right? No, no excuses.</p>
<p>Yeah, 100%.</p>
<p>So let's do some examples for our listeners to make this really clear.</p>
<p>Um I need you here at 10 a.m.</p>
<p>No ifs ands or buts.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you're basically saying we won't accept any? Oh, but I have to come at 1030.</p>
<p>No, unacceptable.</p>
<p>I need, there's no deviation from the plan.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Yes, Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Another example would be, um, sorry, I'm now I got lost.</p>
<p>Ok, here we go.</p>
<p>We are finishing your homework tonight.</p>
<p>No ifs ands or buts.</p>
<p>So that sounds like a parent is saying it to a kid who doesn't want to do homework that you have that to look forward to soon.</p>
<p>Michelle eventually your kids will get to homework, you know, in the evening.</p>
<p>Um, yeah, that's a whole another phase of kids, you know, I think homework starts next year.</p>
<p>So, I mean, kindergarten homework.</p>
<p>So I think it's ok but still they get homework in kindergarten.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Jeez.</p>
<p>That seems, I think so.</p>
<p>I mean, I'm sure it's cute things like, oh, we go, you know, interview your mom, you know, cute things like that.</p>
<p>I can't imagine it's a really going to take that much time.</p>
<p>But we'll see, I get homework until middle school.</p>
<p>I feel like I started getting homework, kind of maybe I'm forgetting.</p>
<p>It was so long ago.</p>
<p>So, I don't know, but I feel like it was kind of later when I was closer to being a teenager.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>No, I remember, I remember homework but um yeah, it definitely gets more intense as time goes on.</p>
<p>So that'll be interesting.</p>
<p>So, this expression is a way of speaking with an authority and maybe it's kind of with a little bit of an attitude, a little bit of an attitude there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You're just basically saying, I don't want to hear anything back from you.</p>
<p>No talking back, no responding, no exceptions, no exceptions to this rule that I'm setting here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right, Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>You could maybe use it in more of a positive way.</p>
<p>So for example, I promise our team will get the job done.</p>
<p>No ifs ands or buts so saying something will definitely happen no matter what.</p>
<p>So you could use it that way as well.</p>
<p>What do you think, Lindsay? Yeah.</p>
<p>So in that sense, you're holding yourself to account, you're saying you can count on me, I'm going to get this done or we're going to get this done.</p>
<p>No ifs ands or buts.</p>
<p>Right, So, yeah, I, I think that could work.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Why not? So this is kind of funny because you asked if I say no ifs ands or buts about it.</p>
<p>And I said, I wasn't really sure.</p>
<p>And here I used just that in an example.</p>
<p>So I suppose I did know it.</p>
<p>You did know it.</p>
<p>Yeah, clearly you did when he wrote the episode, Michelle.</p>
<p>That's so funny.</p>
<p>But I don't know.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Sorry about that.</p>
<p>Lindsay.</p>
<p>I know it was, you were like, huh? And then here I am.</p>
<p>You've got it here.</p>
<p>Well, my example was slightly different.</p>
<p>I said no ifs ands or buts about it.</p>
<p>And your example here is no ifs ands or buts about that and both are totally legit.</p>
<p>Right? I don't know, I don't know what came over me in the beginning.</p>
<p>I guess he caught me off guard.</p>
<p>Um, so, but yeah, you could say no ifs or ands or buts about that or about it as Lindsay said, and I agree wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>So you could say what's an example here? She's the best teacher out there.</p>
<p>No ifs ands or buts about that, right? So you can say about it about it.</p>
<p>There's no arguing, there's no exceptions.</p>
<p>There's no way to argue that that's not true.</p>
<p>It's just a definitive statement.</p>
<p>OK, Love it.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Yo, an annex.</p>
<p>Alright, Michelle.</p>
<p>There must be some other ways that we, you could say the same thing, right? So I guess it does kind of depend on the context here, right? You know, if you're asking your kids to do something is a different context than saying we'll deliver on something at work.</p>
<p>But let's do some examples.</p>
<p>What else? OK, So again, these might more match the first meaning these two.</p>
<p>And it's funny we both have thrown out these examples already and naturally in the, in the conversation.</p>
<p>So the first one is no excuses.</p>
<p>So we have to find a time to get together.</p>
<p>No excuses.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I feel like I could see this with two adult friends.</p>
<p>Like, let's say, like, ladies in their, in their forties and they're busy.</p>
<p>They have families and they're coming back.</p>
<p>We have, you know, we're good friends.</p>
<p>We have to find, find a time to get together, you know, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>We have to, we have to do lunch, you know.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And then you, uh, I believe, said this one, what is it? No exceptions.</p>
<p>Students need to submit a bibliography with each paper.</p>
<p>Mhm.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you can't change it.</p>
<p>There's, there's no, no excuse, no reason not to do it.</p>
<p>Right, Yes, So the other one is more, we're gonna teach one more.</p>
<p>That is more for the other definition, more more for saying something is definite, right? And this one is no doubt about that.</p>
<p>So you could say he's an amazing friend, no doubt about that or no doubt about it.</p>
<p>Yes, I love that one.</p>
<p>That sounds good too, Michelle.</p>
<p>Very common.</p>
<p>Um What else, Michelle? Where do we go from here? The idea is that this is expressing some sort of certainty, certainty that something must happen, something that will happen, something that holds some sort of status, right? Uh So for example, the no doubt about it, right? It's saying that's the best, that's the worst, right? But the other ones are more about something must happen, something will happen.</p>
<p>Are you most likely to use one of these Lindsay.</p>
<p>Do you kind of identify with one of them the most? Oh.</p>
<p>Well, I think no doubt about it.</p>
<p>Um, that is kind of fun to say.</p>
<p>I don't know if I say it a lot but I like the way it sounds.</p>
<p>It has kind of a ring to it.</p>
<p>No doubt about it to it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, and I do want to point something out and saying no ifs ands or buts no excuses, no exceptions.</p>
<p>These are strong.</p>
<p>You don't wanna use these when it's inappropriate to use them.</p>
<p>Also.</p>
<p>I would not say them to your boss.</p>
<p>Yeah, unless you're using it in a positive way like, oh, we're going to get this done.</p>
<p>Um, no ifs ands or buts right in that sense.</p>
<p>But if you're, it can sound like you're scolding someone that's why it sounds like, oh, parents are, oh, you're going to get your homework done now.</p>
<p>No ifs ands or buts.</p>
<p>So you have to think about the context and if it's appropriate to be saying that, yeah, for sure, for sure.</p>
<p>You need to also like just kind of understand who you're talking to and just, yeah, it could sound a little insensitive, I suppose, depending on who you're talking to.</p>

<p>I hit follow so that I don't have to go searching for them, you know, out in the world of podcasts.</p>
<p>So go and do that.</p>
<p>Now guys, we play, let's do it.</p>
<p>We are friends who have just checked into a hotel.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So we have to be there.</p>
<p>Be here, I'm sorry, hold on start again.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So we have to be out of here by 11.</p>
<p>Well, 12 should be fine.</p>
<p>No, they said 11.</p>
<p>No excuses.</p>
<p>Ok, fine.</p>
<p>But we, we will make sure we are out then.</p>
<p>No ifs ands or buts no ifs ands or buts I can't believe there are no exceptions.</p>
<p>They're strict.</p>
<p>No doubt about that.</p>
<p>Oh, very good.</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>Sounds like, yeah, try and get a late, do you try and get a late checkout, Lindsay when you travel sometimes, especially if I'm at a conference because you always want to go to the sessions in the morning.</p>
<p>But then you have to haul your bag and check it.</p>
<p>It's like a whole thing, you know.</p>
<p>Um Yeah, I do.</p>
<p>I like that, but generally if I'm traveling I'm not going to stay in my room until 12 because usually I have something to do.</p>
<p>Um, but it's kind of nice to be able to come back and check out after breakfast or something, you know.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So, um, I said, oh, well, 12 should be fine.</p>
<p>And you said no, they said 11, no excuses, no excuses.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>And then you said, ok, fine.</p>
<p>We'll make sure we're out then and then no ifs ands or buts and I said no ifs ands or buts.</p>
<p>So it sounds like maybe in the past like we've struggled with checking out of the hotel on time.</p>
<p>Right? Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then I said, I can't believe there are no exceptions.</p>
<p>Yeah, they're stric, no doubt about that.</p>
<p>Right, So, this is maybe we know each other pretty well and we've had some kind of drama in the past and you see an extra charge on your credit card, you know, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Right, Yeah.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So, ok.</p>
<p>Well, that's fun.</p>
<p>So, um, yeah, Lindsay, what do you want to say for the end of the episode? What's the takeaway? Well, I think the important thing to remember here is guys, you know, when you want to be, when you want to make sure someone knows that what you've said is the word like it's, it's, it's the truth.</p>
<p>It's the thing that you want people to listen to and you don't want any kind of excuses.</p>
<p>This, this expression really.</p>
<p>It depends on the context.</p>
<p>Again, if you're talking to kids and you don't want to hear excuses from them.</p>
<p>Perfect or if you want to guarantee that something is going to work out also.</p>
<p>Perfect for that.</p>
<p>It just depends on who you're talking to.</p>
<p>The meaning changes based on who you're speaking with.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Very, very good way to put it, Lindsay.</p>
<p>So guys, um, give these a try, think about the context.</p>
<p>Um But I'm curious to hear how it goes for you.</p>
<p>These are, these are really fun ones.</p>
<p>Very, very common.</p>
<p>All right, Michelle, I'll talk to you soon.</p>
<p>Have a good day.</p>
