<p id="p-14">Hello, Aubrey, what's shaking?</p>
<p id="p-15">Not too much, how are you?</p>
<p id="p-16">Good, we're recording today on a Friday and it's sunny out, so I'm very excited to be done with work and get outside.</p>
<p id="p-17">But I do have a question for you, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-18">You ready?</p>
<p id="p-19">Okay, yes.</p>
<p id="p-20">Do you get your hair or your nails done often?</p>
<p id="p-21">Are you always in the salon getting a mani-pedi and a, you know, salon visit?</p>
<p id="p-22">No, absolutely not.</p>
<p id="p-23">I can't stand a pedicure because my feet are too ticklish.</p>
<p id="p-24">Like, don't touch my feet.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-25">Like, don't touch my feet, and it's expensive.</p>
<p id="p-26">My daughter put on glue, I don't know, press-on nails, and she's 10.</p>
<p id="p-27">She couldn't tie her shoes.</p>
<p id="p-28">She couldn't hold a pencil.</p>
<p id="p-29">I'm like, you have to take these off.</p>
<p id="p-30">They're just impractical.</p>
<p id="p-31">Yeah, that's pretty funny.</p>
<p id="p-32">No, I also am not a big salon goer, maybe a few times a year max for the hair, and that's it.</p>
<p id="p-33">Yeah, and haircuts are expensive.</p>
<p id="p-34">In fact, my husband just this morning was cutting his hair with a flowbee.</p>
<p id="p-35">I don't know if you've heard of that.</p>
<p id="p-36">It's like a vacuum that attaches to hair cutting tools.</p>
<p id="p-37">Wow, that's true.</p>
<p id="p-38">And so it sort of vacuums up the hair as it cuts.</p>
<p id="p-39">It's actually kind of amazing.</p>
<p id="p-40">I'm curious if any of our listeners use a flowbee.</p>
<p id="p-41">But I want to know, did he take a flowbee training course?</p>
<p id="p-42">Did he take a course to know how to use the flowbee properly?</p>
<p id="p-43">Because it feels like I would still mess things up.</p>
<p id="p-44">It does seem like we could have it be a disaster.</p>
<p id="p-45">He's been using it for years.</p>
<p id="p-46">He's probably had it for 20 years, so it's quite impressive.</p>
<p id="p-47">Think about how much money he saved over the years.</p>
<p id="p-48">A lot, I know, right?</p>
<p id="p-49">He probably did.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-50">I know, right?</p>
<p id="p-51">He probably did watch a tutorial or two.</p>
<p id="p-52">There were definitely instructions and I think there was a learning curve.</p>
<p id="p-53">The first couple of times he maybe had to go to a barber to have him clean it up after.</p>
<p id="p-54">I think the stakes are usually lower for guys.</p>
<p id="p-55">Just shave it off.</p>
<p id="p-56">We'll start over.</p>
<p id="p-57">Right, right.</p>
<p id="p-58">Yeah, so I love that we started off the episode today with, I asked you, do you get your hair or nails done often?</p>
<p id="p-59">So talking about getting something done or having something done.</p>
<p id="p-60">We've got a great question about this and we're going to share details about this today with some fun examples.</p>
<p id="p-61">So let's get into this.</p>
<p id="p-62">All right, I'm going to read the listener question, but before I read our question from Sophia, I want to remind our listeners, guys, hit the follow button right now to make sure you get five episodes a week of All Ears English.</p>
<p id="p-63">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-64">So here it is.</p>
<p id="p-65">How are you?</p>
<p id="p-66">I'm Sophia.</p>
<p id="p-67">I just want to say thanks for answering my questions.</p>
<p id="p-68">I often can't find answers online, so your insight</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-69">answers online so your insights are really helpful.</p>
<p id="p-70">I have a quick question about the phrases get it done and have it done.</p>
<p id="p-71">They both seem to mean completing something, but I'm not totally clear on when to use each one.</p>
<p id="p-72">Could you help clarify the difference and maybe share a few examples?</p>
<p id="p-73">Thank you so much.</p>
<p id="p-74">Best, Sophia.</p>
<p id="p-75">That is a great question, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-76">Yes, it is a really good question.</p>
<p id="p-77">These have the same meaning.</p>
<p id="p-78">They're both used to talk about something we can't do for ourselves, something we have to have or get someone else to do for us.</p>
<p id="p-79">But get done is more informal.</p>
<p id="p-80">And I asked a few people what they use more.</p>
<p id="p-81">And where I live at least in this regional dialect, quite a few people said they felt like have something done felt very formal to them.</p>
<p id="p-82">They said, I always say get done.</p>
<p id="p-83">I got to get this done.</p>
<p id="p-84">Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p id="p-85">I think it's definitely more formal for sure.</p>
<p id="p-86">I might choose.</p>
<p id="p-87">Yeah, but let's go.</p>
<p id="p-88">Let's explore.</p>
<p id="p-89">Let's explore.</p>
<p id="p-90">So we'll dive into both with examples and kind of</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-91">with examples and kind of share if one feels off.</p>
<p id="p-92">It's definitely interchangeable.</p>
<p id="p-93">Don't stress about this too much.</p>
<p id="p-94">They mean the same thing.</p>
<p id="p-95">People will understand you.</p>
<p id="p-96">But get often, the verb get often makes something informal.</p>
<p id="p-97">All of the different verbs we make with get are going to be more informal.</p>
<p id="p-98">And there are so many, and it's probably time for another episode on that, right?</p>
<p id="p-99">Or maybe to cover get verbs that we haven't done yet on this show.</p>
<p id="p-100">I'm sure that we'll come to that another day.</p>
<p id="p-101">So first one, so get done, right?</p>
<p id="p-102">So paying for a service or having something done for you.</p>
<p id="p-103">All right.</p>
<p id="p-104">For example, get my hair done, get my nails done.</p>
<p id="p-105">Waxing maybe, facials, all of these things that usually people don't do for themselves.</p>
<p id="p-106">They'll say, I get it done at a salon, right?</p>
<p id="p-107">Or lashes.</p>
<p id="p-108">I need to get my lashes done.</p>
<p id="p-109">A lot of people use like, I'm saying false lashes, but there's another word, artificial lashes, eyelashes.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-110">lashes, eyelashes, my brows waxed, something like that.</p>
<p id="p-111">We'll either say I need to get it done.</p>
<p id="p-112">Yes, yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-113">Let's do a little mini role play here.</p>
<p id="p-114">So go for it, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-115">When did you last get your oil changed?</p>
<p id="p-116">Oof, it's been a while.</p>
<p id="p-117">I probably need to get that done.</p>
<p id="p-118">All right, so I need to get my oil changed.</p>
<p id="p-119">Well, I need to get my oil changed, right?</p>
<p id="p-120">Exactly, right?</p>
<p id="p-121">So often this will come up as a response.</p>
<p id="p-122">If someone's asking you, do you need to get blank done?</p>
<p id="p-123">Then when you're talking, oh, I need to get it done.</p>
<p id="p-124">I need to get that done, right?</p>
<p id="p-125">Yes, And so often things that a mechanic would do for your car, things a doctor would need to do for you, anything that you can't do for yourself, that's when we use these phrasal verbs.</p>
<p id="p-126">But the key difference, sometimes you might actually be saying, if we talk about the active voice, I actually need to get something done to take action and complete something myself, right?</p>
<p id="p-127">That's true, right?</p>
<p id="p-128">That's another meaning.</p>
<p id="p-129">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-130">That's a good point.</p>
<p id="p-131">If I need...</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-132">Exactly, that's a good point.</p>
<p id="p-133">If I need to get my homework done, I need to get this work done, then that's different.</p>
<p id="p-134">It's a whole different construction.</p>
<p id="p-135">Right, and then it becomes very different from number two, which is to have something done, someone does it for you.</p>
<p id="p-136">Today we're talking about when someone does something for us, right, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-137">Yes, and this is a little more formal, not tons, but depending on someone's regional dialect, they might be much more used to hearing one or the other.</p>
<p id="p-138">Yeah, so have something done.</p>
<p id="p-139">I actually do agree that it's a little more formal.</p>
<p id="p-140">I would say that too.</p>
<p id="p-141">If I'm kind of trying to, I don't know, sound more fancy, I'm describing a fancier event, I might swap in, have my nails done before my wedding, right?</p>
<p id="p-142">As opposed to get my nails done.</p>
<p id="p-143">A little more posh, but they are very interchangeable.</p>
<p id="p-144">You could say, you know, oh, I need to have my trees trimmed.</p>
<p id="p-145">I need to have that done, right?</p>
<p id="p-146">It does have this name meaning.</p>
<p id="p-147">Yeah, so in a role play, you ready?</p>
<p id="p-148">Should we go for the role play?</p>
<p id="p-149">All right, just got our windows clean.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-150">All right, just got our windows cleaned.</p>
<p id="p-151">It was high time.</p>
<p id="p-152">Oh yeah, I need to have that done.</p>
<p id="p-153">Yeah, so you can see how it's real interchangeable here, right?</p>
<p id="p-154">Exactly, for that you could definitely say I need to get that done.</p>
<p id="p-155">I need to, you know, but either way, you're meaning I need to have someone else do that.</p>
<p id="p-156">I'm not cleaning my windows.</p>
<p id="p-157">I think we're really just showing our listeners that you're not cleaning your own windows, right?</p>
<p id="p-158">We're just showing our listeners they have two options here, right?</p>
<p id="p-159">You really can't go wrong when you interchange them for the most part.</p>
<p id="p-160">Right, Okay, Aubrey, time for a role play.</p>
<p id="p-161">So here we are discussing our cars.</p>
<p id="p-162">Yes, I'm like, I'm going to do a role play where it's something that I would not be able to do myself.</p>
<p id="p-163">I know some of you out there are maybe mechanics or just really good at working on your car.</p>
<p id="p-164">And you maybe would say, I need to do this.</p>
<p id="p-165">But for me, I would say I need to get these things done.</p>
<p id="p-166">Right, because this is all about having someone else do something for us.</p>
<p id="p-167">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-168">It's not my expertise.</p>
<p id="p-169">Me neither.</p>
<p id="p-170">This is a fitting role play for me too.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-171">This is a fitting roleplay for me too.</p>
<p id="p-172">I had to get my brake pads replaced.</p>
<p id="p-173">The brakes on my car had started squeaking.</p>
<p id="p-174">Oh, mine are squeaking too.</p>
<p id="p-175">I need to get that done.</p>
<p id="p-176">Seems like there's always something to fix.</p>
<p id="p-177">For sure.</p>
<p id="p-178">I had to have my alternator worked on last week.</p>
<p id="p-179">Yikes.</p>
<p id="p-180">Hopefully I don't need to have that done.</p>
<p id="p-181">It's so true about cars, especially if you have an expensive car that's really expensive to fix.</p>
<p id="p-182">You're always bringing it in, right?</p>
<p id="p-183">That happened with me.</p>
<p id="p-184">We bought a Volkswagen Passat and I don't know if it was a lemon.</p>
<p id="p-185">We say that for cars that just seem like they need to be fixed all the time because it was a newer car, but just things were going wrong all the time.</p>
<p id="p-186">But now we have a Volkswagen Jetta, never a problem.</p>
<p id="p-187">So sometimes you just never know.</p>
<p id="p-188">Yeah, sometimes it's not.</p>
<p id="p-189">Sometimes I find that certain car.</p>
<p id="p-190">I thought you were going to say the Volkswagen just tended to be expensive or breaking down a lot.</p>
<p id="p-191">But I think sometimes it's just the car.</p>
<p id="p-192">And a lemon is a great bonus word for today, by the way.</p>
<p id="p-193">Right?</p>
<p id="p-194">Yeah, I don't know if I've mentioned this on the podcast, but my dad's favorite joke.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-195">podcast, but my dad's favorite joke when we were learning French and we went to France, he found out that a car in France was a citron, which means lemon in English.</p>
<p id="p-196">And he's like, I can't believe they named this car lemon.</p>
<p id="p-197">But of course, in French, lemon doesn't mean a junky car.</p>
<p id="p-198">Yeah, I love that.</p>
<p id="p-199">That is so funny.</p>
<p id="p-200">That's why we need cultural context when we translate ads for cars and things like that.</p>
<p id="p-201">Definitely.</p>
<p id="p-202">Oh gosh, that's funny.</p>
<p id="p-203">So let's go through this here.</p>
<p id="p-204">So I said I had to get my brake pads replaced, right?</p>
<p id="p-205">Meaning you weren't going to do it yourself.</p>
<p id="p-206">You didn't do it yourself.</p>
<p id="p-207">Someone did it for you.</p>
<p id="p-208">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-209">And then you said, oh, mine are squeaking too.</p>
<p id="p-210">I need to get that done, right?</p>
<p id="p-211">Again, going for the get.</p>
<p id="p-212">Get something done.</p>
<p id="p-213">And we could say, oh, I need to have that done, but this is a little more informal, a little more conversational.</p>
<p id="p-214">Oh, I got to get that done.</p>
<p id="p-215">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-216">Get makes everything more casual, right?</p>
<p id="p-217">And then I said, oh, I had to have my alternator work done.</p>
<p id="p-218">Yeah, Okay.</p>
<p id="p-219">And then I said, yikes.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-220">Okay, and then I said, yikes, meaning ooh, right?</p>
<p id="p-221">Just reacting in a dramatic way.</p>
<p id="p-222">Yeah, but a negative kind of like, that's not great.</p>
<p id="p-223">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-224">And then I said, oh, hopefully I don't need to have that done, right?</p>
<p id="p-225">Yeah, So you could say, hopefully I don't need to get that done, have that done, both interchangeable really.</p>
<p id="p-226">They both just mean something I need to have someone else do for me.</p>
<p id="p-227">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-228">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-229">So what's our takeaway for today?</p>
<p id="p-230">I mean, I love the fact that these are, you know, both about having people do something for us and they are interchangeable.</p>
<p id="p-231">So we have options, but our listeners also have the option to up level.</p>
<p id="p-232">If you're talking about a very fancy, a fancier scenario, you do have that chance to use have, right?</p>
<p id="p-233">You have that option.</p>
<p id="p-234">Yeah, I need to have my hair styled.</p>
<p id="p-235">I need to have my nails done does sound just a little bit fancier, a little bit less informal.</p>
<p id="p-236">Yeah, Anything else to leave our listeners with today?</p>
<p id="p-237">Yeah, I think, you know, this is a fun way to connect really chatting about, like this conversation about our car, things that you need.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-238">about our car, things that you need to get done, things you need, have to have done, whichever phrasal verb you use, right?</p>
<p id="p-239">Strike up a conversation about something like this.</p>
<p id="p-240">Yes, I love it.</p>
