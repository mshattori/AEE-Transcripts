<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p>Hello, Lindsay.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>I'm doing great, Aubrey.</p>
<p>How are you today?</p>
<p>How's it going?</p>
<p>I'm great.</p>
<p>I have a question for you.</p>
<p>Is there anything you have trouble keeping straight?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>You know, it's so funny because everyone's phone number is now in my phone.</p>
<p>And so if I ever don't have my phone, but I need to call someone, I can't keep numbers straight, their phone numbers, unless I knew them from childhood and they're still living in that place, which is unlikely.</p>
<p>So phone numbers, I have a really good example.</p>
<p>I had something happen last summer where we were on a river and I had left my phone in someone else's car.</p>
<p>So we got to the end and we were supposed to call for them to come pick us up.</p>
<p>Yeah, And we didn't have a phone and none of us knew anyone's phone number.</p>
<p>If we don't have our phones, we don't know anyone's number to call anymore.</p>
<p>It kind of scares me about chat GPT.</p>
<p>Are we going to forget how to think entirely?</p>
<p>Right, It's the same idea.</p>
<p>So true.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>Same idea.</p>
<p>So true.</p>
<p>It is hard to keep numbers straight.</p>
<p>Yeah, as kids used to memorize our kids' names straight.</p>
<p>I often call them the wrong name.</p>
<p>Well, that is another level, Aubrey, when you're forgetting your kids' names.</p>
<p>That's trouble.</p>
<p>I find myself going through, I'm like, Adeline, Penelope, Georgia.</p>
<p>I say everyone's name before the right one.</p>
<p>Oh, that's great.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>So I love what we said here.</p>
<p>We said the expression to keep something straight.</p>
<p>Is that what we're going into in today's episode?</p>
<p>Yes, this came up in a recent episode that Michelle and I recorded about phrasal verbs.</p>
<p>And we said, it's hard to keep these all straight.</p>
<p>And so stay to the end.</p>
<p>We'll share what episode that was in case you missed it.</p>
<p>But definitely hit follow if you are missing any of our episodes.</p>
<p>Talk about vocabulary, idioms, phrasal verbs, strategies.</p>
<p>You don't want to miss any of them.</p>
<p>Yes, 100%. And as we said before, bonus episodes as well.</p>
<p>You don't want to miss them.</p>
<p>So hit that follow button.</p>
<p>All right, let's go into number one.</p>
<p>And this is the one that we used at the top of the show to keep straight.</p>
<p>And then we're also going to</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>Straight.</p>
<p>And then we're also going to share some other idioms, sort of related or with straight.</p>
<p>So the first one, keep straight, means to not mix up, right?</p>
<p>To correctly distinguish one thing from another.</p>
<p>So I think about my daughter's soccer coach.</p>
<p>He has this little whiteboard that he always has the names of the girls that are on the field because he has such a hard time keeping their names straight or even just keeping the players straight.</p>
<p>A lot of them look alike, right?</p>
<p>It's tricky.</p>
<p>Oh, I bet.</p>
<p>Yeah, Some people are just not name people.</p>
<p>That can be really hard.</p>
<p>How many times do you need to introduce yourself?</p>
<p>I've been starting to do tango lessons.</p>
<p>I think I might have shared that on the show.</p>
<p>And now I've been to three classes and still asking for names, but the same people are still asking for my name.</p>
<p>So I figure that's okay.</p>
<p>As long as they're still asking for my name, I can still ask.</p>
<p>That's when it gets tricky where you're like, I know that I've talked to you enough times that I should know your name.</p>
<p>I'm still asking for it.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Hopefully by the fourth class, I'll have the name straight.</p>
<p>Right, Keep them straight.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>I'll have the name straight, right?</p>
<p>Keep them straight.</p>
<p>But let's give some examples.</p>
<p>So I talked about my daughter's coach.</p>
<p>He has a difficult time keeping the players' names straight, so he mixes them up.</p>
<p>He'll call the girls the wrong name sometimes.</p>
<p>Or it was clear he had lied when he wasn't able to keep his story straight.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is one way we use this a lot.</p>
<p>Keep your story straight means not mix up the facts.</p>
<p>So if you tell a lie, it's hard to keep straight which details you change.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>And that's why if you're ever in a deposition, I was listening to a podcast episode about someone who worked for Boeing, and he was involved in multiple depositions.</p>
<p>And they asked the same questions over and over again for hours and hours to try to break your story, to try to see if you're lying.</p>
<p>I don't think he was lying, by the way.</p>
<p>But that will happen if you're under pressure in the legal system.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>They're going to see if you can keep your story straight, because if you're lying, you probably can't. Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>All right, so that's a really important one where we see all across the culture, right?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>the culture, right?</p>
<p>Families, the legal system.</p>
<p>Number two, get something straight.</p>
<p>Now this is different.</p>
<p>Yeah, this means to clear up a misunderstanding or to clarify something that's confusing.</p>
<p>So you might say, let's get this straight.</p>
<p>You weren't home until 2 a.m.? This might be something I'd say to my daughter who broke curfew.</p>
<p>And I'm like, let's make sure we're on the same page, make sure there's no misunderstandings here.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the famous phrase here is, let me get this straight.</p>
<p>Let me get this straight.</p>
<p>You might hear that in movies or just in the culture in general, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, that's almost more idiomatic.</p>
<p>That is often said when something is unbelievable or you're kind of saying like, are you serious?</p>
<p>That's really what you're, let me get this straight.</p>
<p>It's a little different, right?</p>
<p>Let me get this straight and then you say something kind of ridiculous.</p>
<p>Is this true?</p>
<p>Is this really what happened?</p>
<p>Is that really what happened?</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Here's another example of get something straight.</p>
<p>I need to get one thing</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>I need to get one thing straight.</p>
<p>I never lied to you.</p>
<p>And what you're saying here is you need to convey clearly one thing.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>This is especially used when there's a misunderstanding or something that is believed that is not true.</p>
<p>You want to clear it up and be like, okay, I need to get one thing straight or I need to get something straight.</p>
<p>We say it both of these ways.</p>
<p>Yes, Number three, think straight.</p>
<p>Think straight.</p>
<p>How about this one, Aubrey?</p>
<p>That means to be able to focus or concentrate.</p>
<p>I say this a lot when my kids are being so noisy.</p>
<p>I can't think straight with all this noise.</p>
<p>How do you handle that noise?</p>
<p>It's really difficult.</p>
<p>Send them outside.</p>
<p>Oh, gosh.</p>
<p>Good thing you live in Arizona.</p>
<p>They can go outside any time of the year.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>Or let's meet in the conference room so we can think straight.</p>
<p>Yeah, So it's just another way of saying so we can really focus, hone in on what we're doing.</p>
<p>Aubrey, question.</p>
<p>If you want to get work done, do you feel like your space needs to be neat and kind of zen?</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>And kind of zen in a sense, or are you okay with a messy space where you work?</p>
<p>I do prefer for it to be neat, right?</p>
<p>Clutter free to get work done, to really be able to think straight.</p>
<p>But you know who especially, I know you've talked about needing to tidy up clutter, right?</p>
<p>My husband cannot think straight if there's any clutter.</p>
<p>Like everything needs to be in its place.</p>
<p>Everything needs to be tidy.</p>
<p>So I know that's pretty common.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's a thing, right?</p>
<p>It's definitely a thing, but then you might find that you spend the time cleaning up the place and then there's no time left to do the work, right?</p>
<p>That's the problem.</p>
<p>All the time I had to do this, I spent tidying.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>Now play it straight is another one we use.</p>
<p>Doing something without tricks or subterfuge.</p>
<p>What does that mean, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yeah, deceit, right?</p>
<p>That's a band nine IELTS word.</p>
<p>That's an impressive subterfuge, which means deceit.</p>
<p>So we also use it to mean honestly or in a trustworthy way.</p>
<p>So for example, I wish you would just play it straight.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>For example, I wish you would just play it straight with me.</p>
<p>Someone might say this about someone they're dating and they feel like they're getting mixed messages or they're being breadcrumbed.</p>
<p>We talked about dating terms recently.</p>
<p>I wish they would just play it straight.</p>
<p>They would be less deceitful, more trustworthy.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>So you could say, okay, play it straight with me.</p>
<p>Where were you last night?</p>
<p>This is again something I might say to my daughter after breaking curfew.</p>
<p>Play it straight means like, okay, just be honest.</p>
<p>Yeah, be honest.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Okay, Aubrey, let's break into a role play here.</p>
<p>So here we are at a happy hour after work.</p>
<p>All right, good.</p>
<p>Start us out.</p>
<p>I can't think straight in here with all this noise.</p>
<p>It is so loud.</p>
<p>Hey, I thought we were meeting tomorrow at five, but Mark just said he thought the plan was seven.</p>
<p>I can never keep time straight when they're changing it so often.</p>
<p>It was switched from five to seven, then six.</p>
<p>I thought it was back to five though.</p>
<p>Let's get something straight.</p>
<p>I was fine with whatever.</p>
<p>So all the time</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>I was fine with whatever, so all the time changes were not my fault.</p>
<p>I feel like someone's not playing it straight.</p>
<p>I wonder if they're planning a surprise or something.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>So something's going on.</p>
<p>Something strange is happening here behind the scenes, right?</p>
<p>Right, We're starting to detect like, okay, something's up.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So I started off by saying, I can't think straight in here with all this noise.</p>
<p>So maybe it's just a noisy bar, right?</p>
<p>Exactly right.</p>
<p>A lot of noise.</p>
<p>And this is how I say instead of like, you know, it's so loud in here, I can't concentrate, I can't focus.</p>
<p>We're much more likely to say, I can't think straight.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>And then you said, Aubrey?</p>
<p>I can never keep times straight when they're changed so often, right?</p>
<p>So if the meeting time or where you're meeting keeps changing, then you'd say like, oh, I can't keep the time straight.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>And then I said, let's get something straight.</p>
<p>I was fine with whatever, so all the time changes were not my fault.</p>
<p>So I'm just trying to tell you, hey, this is not my fault.</p>
<p>I didn't cause this problem.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>fault.</p>
<p>I didn't cause this problem.</p>
<p>Right, Because I don't know, maybe I do think you're the one that needs the time changes, right?</p>
<p>And so you're wanting to clear up that misunderstanding like, okay, let's get something straight.</p>
<p>Not my fault.</p>
<p>Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>And then you said, Aubrey, I feel like someone's not playing it straight.</p>
<p>So I wonder if they're planning a surprise.</p>
<p>So it sounds like you think someone is kind of not being 100% straightforward.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, There's related straight and straightforward in this way, playing it straight, being straightforward.</p>
<p>There's some kind of deceit or subterfuge happening.</p>
<p>So we're starting to sense like, oh, wait, maybe someone's planning a surprise.</p>
<p>I wonder if that's where these expressions came from, straightforward, right?</p>
<p>Get something straight, keep straight, play it straight from the word straightforward potentially.</p>
<p>Yes, probably.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>And they all have such different meanings, like little, you know, sort of related, but this is what's so tricky about idioms and idiomatic phrasal verbs.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>and idiomatic phrasal verbs as well.</p>
<p>It's hard to keep them straight.</p>
<p>Yes, 100%. It is.</p>
<p>And that's why we are here to help our listeners, right, Aubrey?</p>
<p>But there is another episode that our listeners should check out.</p>
<p>Why should they check that one out?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is the episode that inspired this one.</p>
<p>2366, don't blow off this English vocabulary episode.</p>
<p>We were talking about phrasal verbs and we used keep straight when we're talking about how difficult those phrasal verbs with the word blow are to keep straight.</p>
<p>Yes, and I love it.</p>
<p>So as a takeaway today, I agree with you, Aubrey.</p>
<p>It can be hard when we're learning a new language to keep idioms straight.</p>
<p>But I think the key is the more exposure we have to the language, the better.</p>
<p>So that's coming back, listening to All Ears English five days a week, listening to other podcasts, consuming a lot of native natural English.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And these are all very common in daily conversations at work.</p>
<p>None of them are overly formal or informal.</p>
<p>So throw a couple into your conversations.</p>
<p>Throw it in.</p>
<p>See what happens.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>and see what happens.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Good stuff.</p>
<p>All right, Aubrey, well, we'll talk to you very soon.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
