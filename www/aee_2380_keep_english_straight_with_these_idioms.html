<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p id="p-8">Hello, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-9">How are you?</p>
<p id="p-10">I'm doing great, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-11">How are you today?</p>
<p id="p-12">How's it going?</p>
<p id="p-13">I'm great.</p>
<p id="p-14">I have a question for you.</p>
<p id="p-15">Is there anything you have trouble keeping straight?</p>
<p id="p-16">Oh, yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-17">You know, it's so funny because everyone's phone number is now in my phone.</p>
<p id="p-18">And so if I ever don't have my phone, but I need to call someone, I can't keep numbers straight, their phone numbers, unless I knew them from childhood and they're still living in that place, which is unlikely.</p>
<p id="p-19">So phone numbers, I have a really good example.</p>
<p id="p-20">I had something happen last summer where we were on a river and I had left my phone in someone else's car.</p>
<p id="p-21">So we got to the end and we were supposed to call for them to come pick us up.</p>
<p id="p-22">Yeah, And we didn't have a phone and none of us knew anyone's phone number.</p>
<p id="p-23">If we don't have our phones, we don't know anyone's number to call anymore.</p>
<p id="p-24">It kind of scares me about chat GPT.</p>
<p id="p-25">Are we going to forget how to think entirely?</p>
<p id="p-26">Right, It's the same idea.</p>
<p id="p-27">So true.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-28">Same idea.</p>
<p id="p-29">So true.</p>
<p id="p-30">It is hard to keep numbers straight.</p>
<p id="p-31">Yeah, as kids used to memorize our kids' names straight.</p>
<p id="p-32">I often call them the wrong name.</p>
<p id="p-33">Well, that is another level, Aubrey, when you're forgetting your kids' names.</p>
<p id="p-34">That's trouble.</p>
<p id="p-35">I find myself going through, I'm like, Adeline, Penelope, Georgia.</p>
<p id="p-36">I say everyone's name before the right one.</p>
<p id="p-37">Oh, that's great.</p>
<p id="p-38">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-39">So I love what we said here.</p>
<p id="p-40">We said the expression to keep something straight.</p>
<p id="p-41">Is that what we're going into in today's episode?</p>
<p id="p-42">Yes, this came up in a recent episode that Michelle and I recorded about phrasal verbs.</p>
<p id="p-43">And we said, it's hard to keep these all straight.</p>
<p id="p-44">And so stay to the end.</p>
<p id="p-45">We'll share what episode that was in case you missed it.</p>
<p id="p-46">But definitely hit follow if you are missing any of our episodes.</p>
<p id="p-47">Talk about vocabulary, idioms, phrasal verbs, strategies.</p>
<p id="p-48">You don't want to miss any of them.</p>
<p id="p-49">Yes, 100%. And as we said before, bonus episodes as well.</p>
<p id="p-50">You don't want to miss them.</p>
<p id="p-51">So hit that follow button.</p>
<p id="p-52">All right, let's go into number one.</p>
<p id="p-53">And this is the one that we used at the top of the show to keep straight.</p>
<p id="p-54">And then we're also going to</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-55">Straight.</p>
<p id="p-56">And then we're also going to share some other idioms, sort of related or with straight.</p>
<p id="p-57">So the first one, keep straight, means to not mix up, right?</p>
<p id="p-58">To correctly distinguish one thing from another.</p>
<p id="p-59">So I think about my daughter's soccer coach.</p>
<p id="p-60">He has this little whiteboard that he always has the names of the girls that are on the field because he has such a hard time keeping their names straight or even just keeping the players straight.</p>
<p id="p-61">A lot of them look alike, right?</p>
<p id="p-62">It's tricky.</p>
<p id="p-63">Oh, I bet.</p>
<p id="p-64">Yeah, Some people are just not name people.</p>
<p id="p-65">That can be really hard.</p>
<p id="p-66">How many times do you need to introduce yourself?</p>
<p id="p-67">I've been starting to do tango lessons.</p>
<p id="p-68">I think I might have shared that on the show.</p>
<p id="p-69">And now I've been to three classes and still asking for names, but the same people are still asking for my name.</p>
<p id="p-70">So I figure that's okay.</p>
<p id="p-71">As long as they're still asking for my name, I can still ask.</p>
<p id="p-72">That's when it gets tricky where you're like, I know that I've talked to you enough times that I should know your name.</p>
<p id="p-73">I'm still asking for it.</p>
<p id="p-74">I'm sorry.</p>
<p id="p-75">Hopefully by the fourth class, I'll have the name straight.</p>
<p id="p-76">Right, Keep them straight.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-77">I'll have the name straight, right?</p>
<p id="p-78">Keep them straight.</p>
<p id="p-79">But let's give some examples.</p>
<p id="p-80">So I talked about my daughter's coach.</p>
<p id="p-81">He has a difficult time keeping the players' names straight, so he mixes them up.</p>
<p id="p-82">He'll call the girls the wrong name sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-83">Or it was clear he had lied when he wasn't able to keep his story straight.</p>
<p id="p-84">Yeah, this is one way we use this a lot.</p>
<p id="p-85">Keep your story straight means not mix up the facts.</p>
<p id="p-86">So if you tell a lie, it's hard to keep straight which details you change.</p>
<p id="p-87">That's true.</p>
<p id="p-88">And that's why if you're ever in a deposition, I was listening to a podcast episode about someone who worked for Boeing, and he was involved in multiple depositions.</p>
<p id="p-89">And they asked the same questions over and over again for hours and hours to try to break your story, to try to see if you're lying.</p>
<p id="p-90">I don't think he was lying, by the way.</p>
<p id="p-91">But that will happen if you're under pressure in the legal system.</p>
<p id="p-92">Right?</p>
<p id="p-93">They're going to see if you can keep your story straight, because if you're lying, you probably can't. Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-94">All right, so that's a really important one where we see all across the culture, right?</p>
<p id="p-95">Absolutely.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-96">the culture, right?</p>
<p id="p-97">Families, the legal system.</p>
<p id="p-98">Number two, get something straight.</p>
<p id="p-99">Now this is different.</p>
<p id="p-100">Yeah, this means to clear up a misunderstanding or to clarify something that's confusing.</p>
<p id="p-101">So you might say, let's get this straight.</p>
<p id="p-102">You weren't home until 2 a.m.? This might be something I'd say to my daughter who broke curfew.</p>
<p id="p-103">And I'm like, let's make sure we're on the same page, make sure there's no misunderstandings here.</p>
<p id="p-104">Yeah, and the famous phrase here is, let me get this straight.</p>
<p id="p-105">Let me get this straight.</p>
<p id="p-106">You might hear that in movies or just in the culture in general, right?</p>
<p id="p-107">Yeah, that's almost more idiomatic.</p>
<p id="p-108">That is often said when something is unbelievable or you're kind of saying like, are you serious?</p>
<p id="p-109">That's really what you're, let me get this straight.</p>
<p id="p-110">It's a little different, right?</p>
<p id="p-111">Let me get this straight and then you say something kind of ridiculous.</p>
<p id="p-112">Is this true?</p>
<p id="p-113">Is this really what happened?</p>
<p id="p-114">Is that really what happened?</p>
<p id="p-115">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-116">Here's another example of get something straight.</p>
<p id="p-117">I need to get one thing</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-118">I need to get one thing straight.</p>
<p id="p-119">I never lied to you.</p>
<p id="p-120">And what you're saying here is you need to convey clearly one thing.</p>
<p id="p-121">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-122">This is especially used when there's a misunderstanding or something that is believed that is not true.</p>
<p id="p-123">You want to clear it up and be like, okay, I need to get one thing straight or I need to get something straight.</p>
<p id="p-124">We say it both of these ways.</p>
<p id="p-125">Yes, Number three, think straight.</p>
<p id="p-126">Think straight.</p>
<p id="p-127">How about this one, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-128">That means to be able to focus or concentrate.</p>
<p id="p-129">I say this a lot when my kids are being so noisy.</p>
<p id="p-130">I can't think straight with all this noise.</p>
<p id="p-131">How do you handle that noise?</p>
<p id="p-132">It's really difficult.</p>
<p id="p-133">Send them outside.</p>
<p id="p-134">Oh, gosh.</p>
<p id="p-135">Good thing you live in Arizona.</p>
<p id="p-136">They can go outside any time of the year.</p>
<p id="p-137">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-138">Right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-139">Or let's meet in the conference room so we can think straight.</p>
<p id="p-140">Yeah, So it's just another way of saying so we can really focus, hone in on what we're doing.</p>
<p id="p-141">Aubrey, question.</p>
<p id="p-142">If you want to get work done, do you feel like your space needs to be neat and kind of zen?</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-143">And kind of zen in a sense, or are you okay with a messy space where you work?</p>
<p id="p-144">I do prefer for it to be neat, right?</p>
<p id="p-145">Clutter free to get work done, to really be able to think straight.</p>
<p id="p-146">But you know who especially, I know you've talked about needing to tidy up clutter, right?</p>
<p id="p-147">My husband cannot think straight if there's any clutter.</p>
<p id="p-148">Like everything needs to be in its place.</p>
<p id="p-149">Everything needs to be tidy.</p>
<p id="p-150">So I know that's pretty common.</p>
<p id="p-151">Yeah, it's a thing, right?</p>
<p id="p-152">It's definitely a thing, but then you might find that you spend the time cleaning up the place and then there's no time left to do the work, right?</p>
<p id="p-153">That's the problem.</p>
<p id="p-154">All the time I had to do this, I spent tidying.</p>
<p id="p-155">Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-156">Now play it straight is another one we use.</p>
<p id="p-157">Doing something without tricks or subterfuge.</p>
<p id="p-158">What does that mean, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-159">Yeah, deceit, right?</p>
<p id="p-160">That's a band nine IELTS word.</p>
<p id="p-161">That's an impressive subterfuge, which means deceit.</p>
<p id="p-162">So we also use it to mean honestly or in a trustworthy way.</p>
<p id="p-163">So for example, I wish you would just play it straight.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-164">For example, I wish you would just play it straight with me.</p>
<p id="p-165">Someone might say this about someone they're dating and they feel like they're getting mixed messages or they're being breadcrumbed.</p>
<p id="p-166">We talked about dating terms recently.</p>
<p id="p-167">I wish they would just play it straight.</p>
<p id="p-168">They would be less deceitful, more trustworthy.</p>
<p id="p-169">Right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-170">So you could say, okay, play it straight with me.</p>
<p id="p-171">Where were you last night?</p>
<p id="p-172">This is again something I might say to my daughter after breaking curfew.</p>
<p id="p-173">Play it straight means like, okay, just be honest.</p>
<p id="p-174">Yeah, be honest.</p>
<p id="p-175">Good.</p>
<p id="p-176">Okay, Aubrey, let's break into a role play here.</p>
<p id="p-177">So here we are at a happy hour after work.</p>
<p id="p-178">All right, good.</p>
<p id="p-179">Start us out.</p>
<p id="p-180">I can't think straight in here with all this noise.</p>
<p id="p-181">It is so loud.</p>
<p id="p-182">Hey, I thought we were meeting tomorrow at five, but Mark just said he thought the plan was seven.</p>
<p id="p-183">I can never keep time straight when they're changing it so often.</p>
<p id="p-184">It was switched from five to seven, then six.</p>
<p id="p-185">I thought it was back to five though.</p>
<p id="p-186">Let's get something straight.</p>
<p id="p-187">I was fine with whatever.</p>
<p id="p-188">So all the time</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-189">I was fine with whatever, so all the time changes were not my fault.</p>
<p id="p-190">I feel like someone's not playing it straight.</p>
<p id="p-191">I wonder if they're planning a surprise or something.</p>
<p id="p-192">Oh, okay.</p>
<p id="p-193">So something's going on.</p>
<p id="p-194">Something strange is happening here behind the scenes, right?</p>
<p id="p-195">Right, We're starting to detect like, okay, something's up.</p>
<p id="p-196">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-197">So I started off by saying, I can't think straight in here with all this noise.</p>
<p id="p-198">So maybe it's just a noisy bar, right?</p>
<p id="p-199">Exactly right.</p>
<p id="p-200">A lot of noise.</p>
<p id="p-201">And this is how I say instead of like, you know, it's so loud in here, I can't concentrate, I can't focus.</p>
<p id="p-202">We're much more likely to say, I can't think straight.</p>
<p id="p-203">Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-204">And then you said, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-205">I can never keep times straight when they're changed so often, right?</p>
<p id="p-206">So if the meeting time or where you're meeting keeps changing, then you'd say like, oh, I can't keep the time straight.</p>
<p id="p-207">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-208">And then I said, let's get something straight.</p>
<p id="p-209">I was fine with whatever, so all the time changes were not my fault.</p>
<p id="p-210">So I'm just trying to tell you, hey, this is not my fault.</p>
<p id="p-211">I didn't cause this problem.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-212">fault.</p>
<p id="p-213">I didn't cause this problem.</p>
<p id="p-214">Right, Because I don't know, maybe I do think you're the one that needs the time changes, right?</p>
<p id="p-215">And so you're wanting to clear up that misunderstanding like, okay, let's get something straight.</p>
<p id="p-216">Not my fault.</p>
<p id="p-217">Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-218">And then you said, Aubrey, I feel like someone's not playing it straight.</p>
<p id="p-219">So I wonder if they're planning a surprise.</p>
<p id="p-220">So it sounds like you think someone is kind of not being 100% straightforward.</p>
<p id="p-221">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-222">Yeah, There's related straight and straightforward in this way, playing it straight, being straightforward.</p>
<p id="p-223">There's some kind of deceit or subterfuge happening.</p>
<p id="p-224">So we're starting to sense like, oh, wait, maybe someone's planning a surprise.</p>
<p id="p-225">I wonder if that's where these expressions came from, straightforward, right?</p>
<p id="p-226">Get something straight, keep straight, play it straight from the word straightforward potentially.</p>
<p id="p-227">Yes, probably.</p>
<p id="p-228">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-229">And they all have such different meanings, like little, you know, sort of related, but this is what's so tricky about idioms and idiomatic phrasal verbs.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-230">and idiomatic phrasal verbs as well.</p>
<p id="p-231">It's hard to keep them straight.</p>
<p id="p-232">Yes, 100%. It is.</p>
<p id="p-233">And that's why we are here to help our listeners, right, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-234">But there is another episode that our listeners should check out.</p>
<p id="p-235">Why should they check that one out?</p>
<p id="p-236">Yeah, this is the episode that inspired this one.</p>
<p id="p-237">2366, don't blow off this English vocabulary episode.</p>
<p id="p-238">We were talking about phrasal verbs and we used keep straight when we're talking about how difficult those phrasal verbs with the word blow are to keep straight.</p>
<p id="p-239">Yes, and I love it.</p>
<p id="p-240">So as a takeaway today, I agree with you, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-241">It can be hard when we're learning a new language to keep idioms straight.</p>
<p id="p-242">But I think the key is the more exposure we have to the language, the better.</p>
<p id="p-243">So that's coming back, listening to All Ears English five days a week, listening to other podcasts, consuming a lot of native natural English.</p>
<p id="p-244">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-245">And these are all very common in daily conversations at work.</p>
<p id="p-246">None of them are overly formal or informal.</p>
<p id="p-247">So throw a couple into your conversations.</p>
<p id="p-248">Throw it in.</p>
<p id="p-249">See what happens.</p>
<p id="p-250">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-251">Good.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-252">and see what happens.</p>
<p id="p-253">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-254">Good stuff.</p>
<p id="p-255">All right, Aubrey, well, we'll talk to you very soon.</p>
<p id="p-256">Awesome.</p>
<p id="p-257">See you next time.</p>
<p id="p-258">All right, take care.</p>
<p id="p-259">Bye.</p>
<p id="p-260">You too.</p>
