<p id="p-15">Hello, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-16">How's it going today?</p>
<p id="p-17">Good, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-18">Lindsay, are you in the middle of anything right now besides recording, obviously, maybe a good book, maybe a series?</p>
<p id="p-19">Yeah, I'm actually in the middle of, I'm not actually in the middle technically, but I just started another book and you've probably, you may have read it.</p>
<p id="p-20">It's called Wild.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-21">You may have read it.</p>
<p id="p-22">It's called Wild.</p>
<p id="p-23">No, I didn't. I've heard of it.</p>
<p id="p-24">Have you seen the movie?</p>
<p id="p-25">No.</p>
<p id="p-26">No.</p>
<p id="p-27">Yeah, it's a good story.</p>
<p id="p-28">The writing is actually really, really good.</p>
<p id="p-29">It's my second time reading it.</p>
<p id="p-30">And as I got started, I read the reviews, and she really is a great writer.</p>
<p id="p-31">Yeah, Cheryl Strayed.</p>
<p id="p-32">Yeah, Oh, it's your second time reading it.</p>
<p id="p-33">My second time reading it, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-34">Because I think the book is better than the movie, and I'm always hunting down books in my house.</p>
<p id="p-35">I don't plan ahead enough to research what I should read, so I look on my shelves and think, what can I read?</p>
<p id="p-36">Yeah, so I just finished a book called The Husbands, and that was about this, maybe I told you, this woman who she comes back home one day and she has a husband, but she never had a husband, and then every time the husband goes into the attic, they come down as a different person, and she keeps on... It's a commentary on kind of the swiping that is now common with dating and just always looking for the next best thing.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-37">for the next best thing.</p>
<p id="p-38">I know that's not good.</p>
<p id="p-39">But now I've started reading a book called Lessons in Chemistry.</p>
<p id="p-40">So I'm at the start of that.</p>
<p id="p-41">But anyway, what I was going to say is that normally I always have to have the next book lined up.</p>
<p id="p-42">Yes, interesting.</p>
<p id="p-43">OK, you don't want to have any dead zones, right, where you're not reading something.</p>
<p id="p-44">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-45">Well, because if I lose it, like if I lose the momentum, then it could be gone for a couple of years, literally.</p>
<p id="p-46">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-47">So I remembered that my I didn't want to read.</p>
<p id="p-48">I had a couple of books on deck that I just happen to have in my house.</p>
<p id="p-49">And I decided against them because I wasn't in the mood for anything scary and I only had scary books.</p>
<p id="p-50">So I chose the book that my sister-in-law lent me.</p>
<p id="p-51">So what about you?</p>
<p id="p-52">What are you reading?</p>
<p id="p-53">Oh, you already said Wild.</p>
<p id="p-54">Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-55">Wild.</p>
<p id="p-56">It's a good one.</p>
<p id="p-57">I recommend it for sure.</p>
<p id="p-58">I'm not quite in the middle of it yet, but, you know, that's what we're getting into, though.</p>
<p id="p-59">Right, Michelle, today to be in the middle of something, to be kind of halfway through.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-60">kind of halfway through.</p>
<p id="p-61">Michelle, what exactly are, why are we talking about this today?</p>
<p id="p-62">Yeah, well, because we did a series.</p>
<p id="p-63">Actually, we're in the middle of a series now, actually, about progress.</p>
<p id="p-64">And this was, part one was actually over on the Business English podcast.</p>
<p id="p-65">And that was episode, just this past week, episode 374 was Describe Your Progress, Getting Started.</p>
<p id="p-66">Yes, Yeah, so we're having fun with this series.</p>
<p id="p-67">In that episode, we spoke about getting ready for something.</p>
<p id="p-68">So different vocabulary to say you're about to begin.</p>
<p id="p-69">So guys, but we want to make sure that you hit the follow button wherever you're listening.</p>
<p id="p-70">Hit it on All Ears English.</p>
<p id="p-71">Also hit it over on Business English because guess what?</p>
<p id="p-72">The third episode, the third and final episode is going to be back on the Business English.</p>
<p id="p-73">Okay, good.</p>
<p id="p-74">So we're going back to Business English for the third.</p>
<p id="p-75">Back to business.</p>
<p id="p-76">You do need to be following both shows to get the full series, the beginning, the middle, and the end.</p>
<p id="p-77">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-78">So perfect.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-79">So perfect.</p>
<p id="p-80">Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-81">All right.</p>
<p id="p-82">So today we are going to talk about how to say that we've already gotten started with something and we're kind of in the middle.</p>
<p id="p-83">So this can be used for a process that you're doing that you want to express or you want to ask about.</p>
<p id="p-84">Could be used for many different reasons.</p>
<p id="p-85">But Lindsay, why would this be important, do you think?</p>
<p id="p-86">Well, I really like the importance of I mean, often when I'm busy and someone asked me to do something, I'll say, oh, I'm in the middle of doing this.</p>
<p id="p-87">Can I do it later?</p>
<p id="p-88">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-89">So telling someone that you're busy, right?</p>
<p id="p-90">Telling someone that you're fully immersed, you're it's not like you just started or just finishing up.</p>
<p id="p-91">No, you're in the middle of it.</p>
<p id="p-92">That's that's a big deal.</p>
<p id="p-93">Or when you're sharing something special that you're doing.</p>
<p id="p-94">I'm in the middle of visiting my kid's college campus or something, for example.</p>
<p id="p-95">What else, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-96">Anything else?</p>
<p id="p-97">Right, Well, or asking somebody what they're doing, right?</p>
<p id="p-98">You know, this is all about</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-99">This is all about connecting.</p>
<p id="p-100">So this is going to be huge.</p>
<p id="p-101">But yeah, Lindsay, in the middle of something that is, I mean, so common.</p>
<p id="p-102">I mean, let's talk about let's do that and we'll do some other ways to share that we're in the middle.</p>
<p id="p-103">So the first one, like we said, I'm in the middle of something.</p>
<p id="p-104">So you could say I'm in the middle of the best show right now.</p>
<p id="p-105">You have to watch it.</p>
<p id="p-106">Yeah, What's interesting about these expressions is it, yes, it is about a time span, but it's not so much about a time.</p>
<p id="p-107">Like if I'm watching a movie, I don't have to be if it's a 90 minute movie, I don't have to be at the 45 minute mark to be able to say this.</p>
<p id="p-108">It's more about saying I'm enmeshed in something.</p>
<p id="p-109">I'm engrossed in something.</p>
<p id="p-110">Right, Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-111">That's true.</p>
<p id="p-112">Right, It's not so much about being exact.</p>
<p id="p-113">Right, Yes, Yeah, There could be other ways to say that or to be more clear about that, which we could talk about in the future.</p>
<p id="p-114">But yeah, in the middle of you, you don't need to be exactly in the middle.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-115">like for example, you would probably say something like, oh, I'm halfway through the movie, it'll be done in 45 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-116">If you really want to say you're in the middle of the movie.</p>
<p id="p-117">But what you're saying here is you are actively engaged in something.</p>
<p id="p-118">Right, Yep.</p>
<p id="p-119">Yep, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-120">So that one is, to me, that one just rolls off the tongue, right?</p>
<p id="p-121">I would practice that one with the pronunciation, just getting really comfortable because it's very, it uses a lot of connecting in the middle of it, in the middle of it, in the middle of it, right?</p>
<p id="p-122">It sounds like one word.</p>
<p id="p-123">Yeah, I love this one, in the thick of it.</p>
<p id="p-124">For some reason when I think about this expression, I think of the jungle.</p>
<p id="p-125">I don't know why, but.</p>
<p id="p-126">I understand that.</p>
<p id="p-127">Yeah, It's like you're pulling back all the ferns and whatever you come into contact with in the jungle is very thick.</p>
<p id="p-128">I'm in the thick of it.</p>
<p id="p-129">It's more intense.</p>
<p id="p-130">Something is more intense, right?</p>
<p id="p-131">I'm in the thick of school exams right now.</p>
<p id="p-132">I can't wait until they're over.</p>
<p id="p-133">So it's an intense period of time.</p>
<p id="p-134">Right, Yes, exactly.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-135">Right, Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-136">I wouldn't say I'm in the thick of a good book.</p>
<p id="p-137">Right, Or I'm in the thick of my day off, like my leisurely day off.</p>
<p id="p-138">No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p id="p-139">Picking lemonade, sitting by the pool.</p>
<p id="p-140">No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p id="p-141">Right, And actually in the thick of it can really also be used to comment on somebody else's experience.</p>
<p id="p-142">You could say, oh, yeah, like I've been working so hard on this and it's tax season, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p id="p-143">And you could say, wow, you're really in the thick of it right now, aren't you?</p>
<p id="p-144">Right, Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-145">And then one bonus kind of comes to my mind being like going through it.</p>
<p id="p-146">You're really going through it.</p>
<p id="p-147">Right, So if this is a little different and I don't want to veer the topic too much, we could cover this another day.</p>
<p id="p-148">But, you know, I recently had and I got a little bit sick recently and I had to heal from my sickness.</p>
<p id="p-149">And, you know, and someone might say to me, you're really going through it.</p>
<p id="p-150">Right, You're going through it.</p>
<p id="p-151">So this is kind of a slangy thing that's modern right now.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-152">modern right now, acknowledging that someone is struggling.</p>
<p id="p-153">Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-154">She's going through it, right?</p>
<p id="p-155">Actually, yeah, this is a great idea for another episode.</p>
<p id="p-156">We'll come back to it.</p>
<p id="p-157">Hit follow.</p>
<p id="p-158">We're gonna take a quick break and we'll be right back.</p>
<p id="p-159">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-160">All right, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-161">So another one is in the midst of.</p>
<p id="p-162">So we're in the midst of moving.</p>
<p id="p-163">So there are boxes everywhere.</p>
<p id="p-164">Yes, Moving is no fun.</p>
<p id="p-165">Love that.</p>
<p id="p-166">Or during.</p>
<p id="p-167">So this is just a more simple word.</p>
<p id="p-168">A similar idea.</p>
<p id="p-169">Basically, being between two bookends, right?</p>
<p id="p-170">So we should just relax during the flight while we're flying during the flight.</p>
<p id="p-171">Yeah, Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-172">So, Lindsay, which is your favorite?</p>
<p id="p-173">I always have to ask.</p>
<p id="p-174">I like in the thick of it.</p>
<p id="p-175">I think that's kind of descriptive language.</p>
<p id="p-176">Again, it makes me think of the jungle.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-177">Again, it makes me think of the jungle.</p>
<p id="p-178">I'm bushwhacking with my machete, and I'm trying to pull back the ferns and things.</p>
<p id="p-179">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-180">Are you wearing some sort of hat, some sort of special hat?</p>
<p id="p-181">Yes, of course.</p>
<p id="p-182">I'm imagining you in some sort of... Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-183">A park ranger or something.</p>
<p id="p-184">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-185">Yes, yes.</p>
<p id="p-186">Michelle, shall we do a roleplay?</p>
<p id="p-187">Let's do it.</p>
<p id="p-188">So here we are.</p>
<p id="p-189">We are friends at lunch.</p>
<p id="p-190">Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-191">I'm going to see Wicked soon, in a few weeks, actually.</p>
<p id="p-192">I'm so excited.</p>
<p id="p-193">We're going to talk about it in this roleplay.</p>
<p id="p-194">Okay, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-195">Have you seen Wicked?</p>
<p id="p-196">I'm in the middle of it right now.</p>
<p id="p-197">It's a long movie.</p>
<p id="p-198">I know.</p>
<p id="p-199">I had to get up to go to the bathroom during the movie three times when I saw it in the theater.</p>
<p id="p-200">So how has everything else been?</p>
<p id="p-201">Fine, fine.</p>
<p id="p-202">I'm actually in the midst of applying to new jobs.</p>
<p id="p-203">Oh, wow.</p>
<p id="p-204">Good luck.</p>
<p id="p-205">Thanks.</p>
<p id="p-206">I'm in the thick of updating my resume right now.</p>
<p id="p-207">I can look it over for you if you want.</p>
<p id="p-208">Oh, that'd be great.</p>
<p id="p-209">Thanks.</p>
<p id="p-210">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-211">Yes, love that.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-212">Yes, love that.</p>
<p id="p-213">Oh yes.</p>
<p id="p-214">So we're talking about the movie Wicked, but yeah, I'm looking forward to seeing the play soon.</p>
<p id="p-215">Did you see the play?</p>
<p id="p-216">Oh, right.</p>
<p id="p-217">But did you see the movie?</p>
<p id="p-218">I have not seen the movie because I was trying not to see it because I'm going to save it.</p>
<p id="p-219">Yeah, You know?</p>
<p id="p-220">I actually, it's funny.</p>
<p id="p-221">I forgot that I had written this role play and I finally did.</p>
<p id="p-222">Because now you can stream Wicked at home.</p>
<p id="p-223">So we did, but yeah, we did have to cut it into two parts.</p>
<p id="p-224">Really?</p>
<p id="p-225">Is it that long?</p>
<p id="p-226">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-227">It's about two hours and 40 minutes, I think.</p>
<p id="p-228">That's a long movie.</p>
<p id="p-229">It's a long movie.</p>
<p id="p-230">So we did, because we started it too late one night, so we had to finish it.</p>
<p id="p-231">But I mean, it really, to me, I'm not giving anything away, but it was a beautifully done movie.</p>
<p id="p-232">It just visually, visually, it was absolutely gorgeous.</p>
<p id="p-233">When you do watch the movie, let me know.</p>
<p id="p-234">But when are you seeing the show soon?</p>
<p id="p-235">Yeah, we're flying to New York in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p id="p-236">Actually, probably before this comes out.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-237">before this comes out, we're gonna fly to New York and go see Wicked.</p>
<p id="p-238">I'm looking forward to it.</p>
<p id="p-239">I'm excited for you.</p>
<p id="p-240">Have a good time.</p>
<p id="p-241">All right, let's do it.</p>
<p id="p-242">All right, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-243">So we said, I said, I'm in the middle of it right now.</p>
<p id="p-244">You said, have you seen Wicked?</p>
<p id="p-245">You said, I'm in the middle of it right now.</p>
<p id="p-246">Meaning, again, it doesn't have to mean I'm at, you know, exactly at the halfway mark of the movie, right, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-247">That's important.</p>
<p id="p-248">It could be really anytime after you've started it.</p>
<p id="p-249">Right, exactly, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-250">So I said, I know about it being a long movie.</p>
<p id="p-251">Had to go to the bathroom during the movie three times when I saw it in the theater.</p>
<p id="p-252">I didn't see it in the theater, but yeah.</p>
<p id="p-253">And then I said, how's everything else been?</p>
<p id="p-254">And you said, fine, fine.</p>
<p id="p-255">I'm actually in the midst of applying to new jobs.</p>
<p id="p-256">So you're mixing up, and you could have said, I guess you couldn't have said I'm in the middle of applying, doesn't feel right.</p>
<p id="p-257">You could, you could, but to me this sounds, yeah, I'm in the midst of just another</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-258">I'm in the midst of just another choice here for our listeners.</p>
<p id="p-259">I'm in the midst of applying to new jobs.</p>
<p id="p-260">You know why I think you, because I think you feel that way because there's no clear beginning and end, right?</p>
<p id="p-261">We don't know when it's going to end.</p>
<p id="p-262">A book, you know when it's going to end.</p>
<p id="p-263">A movie, you know the duration, right?</p>
<p id="p-264">So I think that's maybe why it sounds a little bit different.</p>
<p id="p-265">Yes, I 100% agree with you.</p>
<p id="p-266">You need like an entity that you're kind of consuming and you know exactly when it begins, when it ends to use in the middle of something.</p>
<p id="p-267">But in the midst of something is a little more chaotic, maybe less clear when it's going to end, when it's going to start, are you going to take a break, right?</p>
<p id="p-268">That kind of thing.</p>
<p id="p-269">Right, right, right.</p>
<p id="p-270">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-271">And then I said, oh wow, you said, oh wow, good luck.</p>
<p id="p-272">And then I said, you said, thanks.</p>
<p id="p-273">I'm in the thick of updating my resume now.</p>
<p id="p-274">And here's where we get into that intensity a little bit, right?</p>
<p id="p-275">This one signals intensity a bit more than the others.</p>
<p id="p-276">Again, imagine the jungle.</p>
<p id="p-277">It's very hot and sticky.</p>
<p id="p-278">Imagine</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-279">Imagine Lindsay walking through the jungle.</p>
<p id="p-280">I'd rather walk through the jungle than update my resume.</p>
<p id="p-281">That's funny.</p>
<p id="p-282">Oh God, good stuff here.</p>
<p id="p-283">All right, Michelle, what should we stay tuned for next in terms of part three?</p>
<p id="p-284">Again, remind our listeners where it's going to be.</p>
<p id="p-285">All right, so that is going to be, again, over on the Business English Podcast.</p>
<p id="p-286">So remember, just to give you that number before we did episode 374, not all ears English on the Business English Podcast, our other show, and that was describe your progress, getting started.</p>
<p id="p-287">So now that you are in the middle of this series, if you haven't listened to the beginning, go and do that over on Business English and be sure to hit follow on both of the podcasts so that you don't miss the third and final episode of the series about endings.</p>
<p id="p-288">Perfect.</p>
<p id="p-289">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-290">And what's the takeaway today?</p>
<p id="p-291">Is there any overarching thought here for our listeners when it comes to connection?</p>
<p id="p-292">To me, this is really important for connection.</p>
<p id="p-293">I mean, it could be used in the business world.</p>
<p id="p-294">Today, we've been talking about</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-295">Today we've been talking about it a little bit more casually, but it's just really sharing.</p>
<p id="p-296">I like what Lindsay said, like what you're immersed in right now.</p>
<p id="p-297">It doesn't have to be exactly the middle, but it just, it does.</p>
<p id="p-298">It's always a good connection topic even to say, oh, are you in the middle of any good shows right now?</p>
<p id="p-299">Are you in the middle of a good book?</p>
<p id="p-300">Right?</p>
<p id="p-301">It's just a really great way to, because once you're in the middle, you're kind of in it.</p>
<p id="p-302">You're really in it.</p>
<p id="p-303">And so there might be a lot, there's going to be a lot to talk about at that point.</p>
<p id="p-304">Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-305">It gives people signals as to what your life looks like right now too, right?</p>
<p id="p-306">If you're in the thick of applying for new jobs or doing something intense, right?</p>
<p id="p-307">That gives people signals as to how they can kind of support you potentially.</p>
<p id="p-308">So there's a lot of connection here, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-309">Huge connection episode.</p>
<p id="p-310">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-311">I'm glad we talked about this today and yeah, enjoy Wicked when you go see it.</p>
<p id="p-312">All right, Michelle, I'll talk to you soon.</p>

<p id="p-314">All right, you too.</p>
<p id="p-315">Bye.</p>
