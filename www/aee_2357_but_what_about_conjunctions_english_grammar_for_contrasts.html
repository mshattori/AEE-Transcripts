<p>Hello, Lindsay, how are you?</p>
<p>Hey, Aubrey, I'm doing well.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>I am great.</p>
<p>It's winter in Arizona.</p>
<p>Yes, Speaking of winter, what is your favorite season?</p>
<p>I would say winter in Arizona.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>I would say winter in Arizona, not winter in Idaho, where it's snowy and cold.</p>
<p>But what about fall when, you know, just the hot air is cooling down and you can finally go outside and breathe?</p>
<p>Isn't that a great time of year?</p>
<p>Not in Arizona.</p>
<p>I would love fall in Colorado and I did love fall growing up in the Northwest.</p>
<p>But in Arizona, fall is hot and miserable.</p>
<p>You're ready for it to cool down and it doesn't until like Christmas.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, you kind of have six months of hot, miserable weather in Arizona.</p>
<p>Yes, and then six months of beautiful weather.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>But I love how you followed up your question saying, but what about fall?</p>
<p>We often do in informal conversations, we will start a question with but.</p>
<p>We got a great question about but versus though, when to know which to use.</p>
<p>And then we're also going to kind of dive into that advice to never start a sentence with but.</p>
<p>Miss Kim, you do that.</p>
<p>Yeah, there's a lot to talk about today in today's episode.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>a lot to talk about today.</p>
<p>And today's episode is inspired by a YouTube viewer.</p>
<p>A great question.</p>
<p>Remember guys, we do have a YouTube channel for All Ears English.</p>
<p>Go over to YouTube and type in All Ears English and hit subscribe right away to be able to watch us on video.</p>
<p>If that's how you prefer to learn, that is a good option for you.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>This was from SATV1GT.</p>
<p>It's always just like a YouTube handle.</p>
<p>So definitely ask questions if you want a shout out.</p>
<p>Yeah, please do.</p>
<p>They said, what a good morning.</p>
<p>Thanks to you, Lindsay and Aubrey, you're doing a great job.</p>
<p>I love this so much.</p>
<p>It's an amazing morning because I listened to the All Ears English podcast.</p>
<p>We love that.</p>
<p>We love that.</p>
<p>We love that we can be a part of your day.</p>
<p>It's an honor for us.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>And then they said, I was just wondering about the difference between but and though.</p>
<p>Are they used for the same purpose?</p>
<p>And can one of them be in the middle of phrases and the other in the end?</p>
<p>Or is there more to it than this?</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>more to it than this.</p>
<p>So this is a great question.</p>
<p>And it's a follow up.</p>
<p>It's part two to part one was All Ears English 2346, all about though.</p>
<p>This is tricky English grammar though.</p>
<p>So if you haven't consumed that one, I would stay on this episode.</p>
<p>And then when we finish, go back and consume part one 2346, right?</p>
<p>You don't have to have heard that one first to hear that one.</p>
<p>So stay to the end and then go check out that one.</p>
<p>And be sure you're following all three of our podcasts.</p>
<p>Part three is going to be on IELTS Energy.</p>
<p>And we're going to share some other impressive linking phrases for contrasts like though that would be great for the IELTS exam and just great for speaking and writing in general.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>So go and hit follow on the IELTS Energy podcast to be ready for part three in this series.</p>
<p>Aubrey, let's break it down.</p>
<p>Where should we start today for our listeners?</p>
<p>So you're going to hear all about though in part one, which can be at the beginning, middle and end.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>beginning, middle, and end.</p>
<p>It's used a lot of different ways.</p>
<p>Today we're focusing more on but, but we will talk about a time when we would use though instead of but, so stick around so you don't miss that.</p>
<p>But is typically in the middle of a sentence as a coordinating conjunction, connects two independent clauses.</p>
<p>So these are sentences that could stand on their own, that it would be two simple sentences.</p>
<p>We use a conjunction to combine them together, to have a compound or a complex sentence.</p>
<p>Yeah, lots of fancy grammar terminology there, but let's give our listeners a couple of examples so they can see what we're saying here.</p>
<p>How about this one, Aubrey?</p>
<p>I was supposed to have class today, but it was canceled, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, so you can see it's used to introduce contrasting ideas, right?</p>
<p>Different conjunctions are used for different things, and it's just for more information, but it's showing a contrast.</p>
<p>So normally I have class, but today it was canceled.</p>
<p>I would say we don't usually eat out, but we didn't feel like cooking today.</p>
<p>Exactly, so showing that contrast.</p>
<p>And that is so important because</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>that contrast.</p>
<p>And that is so important because we also change our tone of voice at the higher levels.</p>
<p>We don't stay monotone as we insert the but, right?</p>
<p>I heard your tone of voice change there.</p>
<p>Could you say that second example again?</p>
<p>We don't usually eat out, but we didn't feel like cooking today.</p>
<p>Yeah, you're going to have interesting intonation because it makes sense when you're showing a contrast.</p>
<p>So in some ways, this but does more than just link the two contrasting pieces of the sentence.</p>
<p>It allows you to have kind of a benchmark or a signpost or a separation in what you're saying so you're not monotone.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It would be strange to just have two simple sentences.</p>
<p>We don't usually eat out.</p>
<p>We didn't feel like cooking today.</p>
<p>So you'd still need like, so we did.</p>
<p>It really wouldn't make sense.</p>
<p>You need that conjunction to emphasize the contrast.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>What else do we need to know here, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yeah, so if you are doing a deep dive on but, you're likely going to see the advice to not use but to start sentences.</p>
<p>This is for academic writing.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>This is for academic writing, formal writing, but as a stylistic choice, sometimes we will see it in writing and you can absolutely, especially for questions like Lindsay's follow-up, but what about fall?</p>
<p>Fall is amazing.</p>
<p>We often will start a sentence with but when we're speaking.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>The writing techniques that I learned in high school don't apply to the way I speak and connect with human beings, right, in English?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>In high school or in college, they tell you never start a sentence in a more academic paper with but.</p>
<p>Fine, that's true.</p>
<p>However, there's a lot of opportunities and you mentioned, Aubrey, as a stylistic choice.</p>
<p>If you read novels, you'll see that for sure.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yes, Right?</p>
<p>It's very intentional when that happens, but you'll hear it in conversations all the time.</p>
<p>Let's do a little mini role play to show how that could happen.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I'm leaving at 4.30 for the game.</p>
<p>But I thought you had to be there at 4. They pushed it back and it starts at 5 now.</p>
<p>Yeah, so very common, of course.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>Very common, of course.</p>
<p>Yes, and I could say just, I thought you had to be there at four.</p>
<p>Starting with but does make it a little more informal, a little more conversational.</p>
<p>They mean the same thing, and it does emphasize that contrast a little bit.</p>
<p>Like, oh, well, I thought it was this.</p>
<p>Yeah, you also could have said, I thought you had to be there at four, though.</p>
<p>I mean, that's conversational too, right?</p>
<p>You might see that, but I love the idea.</p>
<p>It's more direct.</p>
<p>But I thought you had to be there at four, but this, but that.</p>
<p>You just hear it a lot.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, you're going to hear it a lot.</p>
<p>You can absolutely use it.</p>
<p>So don't let this, you know, if you're thinking, oh, wait, I shouldn't start this with but.</p>
<p>No, if you are speaking, absolutely, there's no reason not to.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>And the idea of stopping and thinking, oh, my academic teacher told me not to do this.</p>
<p>I think connection and verbal expression is so different from writing a paper.</p>
<p>So never let the rules of writing a paper get in the way of connection.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yes, right.</p>
<p>That's very good advice.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So here's a question.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So here's a question.</p>
<p>Sometimes we will choose though over but when we're speaking, writing too, but when we're speaking, when would we do that, Lindsay?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think when we need to really emphasize that contrast or, ooh, I like this one because it's all about spontaneity.</p>
<p>When we realize the contrast is occurring as we're speaking, because the truth is the way we speak, our native languages or English, we're thinking of what's going on as we're saying it.</p>
<p>Exactly, right?</p>
<p>It's fluid, it's flexible.</p>
<p>So often you just throw it in because you realize I need to emphasize this contrast.</p>
<p>So for example, I'll say a sentence with but and then you say it with though, okay, Lindsay?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I'm hoping Mark comes to the party, but he didn't come last time, so I doubt it.</p>
<p>Yeah, and here's the same thing with though.</p>
<p>I'm hoping Mark comes to the party, though he didn't come last time, so I doubt it.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, and with but,</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>Yeah, with but, it's sort of you're just throwing out a statement.</p>
<p>With though, there is that emphasis in the contrast.</p>
<p>And I could see myself using though when it's like as I'm speaking, I realize it's probably not going to happen.</p>
<p>I'm hoping Mark comes though.</p>
<p>He didn't come last time, so I doubt it.</p>
<p>You're kind of thinking out loud.</p>
<p>And this is a lot of what we do in English, right?</p>
<p>100%. This is the way to get to that natural level.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>Okay, Aubrey.</p>
<p>So let's go into a couple of interesting expressions using if and but, but other buts.</p>
<p>Yes, we want to share a couple of fun ones.</p>
<p>First is just no ifs, ands, or buts.</p>
<p>This is a great expression that means certainly or definitely, right?</p>
<p>You're wanting to emphasize your surety that something will happen.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Yes, So for example, we're going to Disneyland this year.</p>
<p>No ifs, ands, or buts.</p>
<p>Yes, Yeah, we might use this if we're wanting to tell someone we won't accept an excuse from them.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>accept an excuse from them.</p>
<p>And then we also shorten it and we'll just say no buts, right?</p>
<p>We might say, let's do a little mini roleplay to show this.</p>
<p>So you're coming to my party Saturday, right?</p>
<p>Well, I... No buts, you have to be there.</p>
<p>So you kind of cut me off right there.</p>
<p>I cut you off.</p>
<p>I'm like, I will not accept your excuses.</p>
<p>We'll also just say no excuses.</p>
<p>Yes, There are a lot of ways to say this.</p>
<p>This could be the source of another episode entirely, for sure.</p>
<p>But this is good.</p>
<p>So for me, it's more common to hear no ifs, ands, or buts, but I like the idea of shortening it and just saying no, no buts, you're coming, okay?</p>
<p>You're coming.</p>
<p>So fun.</p>
<p>Let's do a roleplay where we can show, of course, but and though in a sentence, and then also these fun expressions.</p>
<p>We are at a family reunion in this roleplay.</p>
<p>Oh boy, here we go.</p>
<p>I'm so glad you made it.</p>
<p>Your parents usually come, but I don't think I've seen you at one of these before.</p>
<p>I know it's the first time I've been able to attend.</p>
<p>Something always...</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>I've been able to attend.</p>
<p>Something always comes up, but this time I was like, I'm going.</p>
<p>No ifs, ands, or buts.</p>
<p>That's what my mom said to me when I told her I had to work.</p>
<p>She said, no buts.</p>
<p>Your mom is the best, though she did beat me at UNO this morning.</p>
<p>So clearly with that last one, we'll break down the last one first.</p>
<p>You came up with that idea as you said that, didn't you?</p>
<p>It's kind of spontaneous in the moment.</p>
<p>Totally, right?</p>
<p>I'm like, your mom's the best.</p>
<p>And then I remember she beat me at this game this morning.</p>
<p>So then I add this, so more to be funny, right?</p>
<p>Though she did beat me at UNO this morning.</p>
<p>And I think the reason that works for the spontaneous thinking is because you're actually resting on though more than we do on but.</p>
<p>I think if you already had that in mind that you were going to say she beat you at UNO, you probably would have said, your mom's the best, but she beat me at UNO this morning.</p>
<p>That's kind of pre-prepared.</p>
<p>You already knew it.</p>
<p>But with this one, though, she did beat me at UNO.</p>
<p>So that idea is coming to you in the moment.</p>
<p>So you're waiting to formulate the idea.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>to formulate the idea.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Yeah, and then when we've sort of formulated in that moment, I think that's why we add though to emphasize the contrast.</p>
<p>Like, okay, I just said this positive thing, and now I'm really highlighting this contrast.</p>
<p>Yeah, because you need something, right?</p>
<p>You need something to contrast there.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Let's go over what else we said here, Aubrey.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you started it and you're saying your parents usually come, but I don't think I've seen you at one of these before.</p>
<p>And this, it's like you said, it's sort of more pre-planned, so then we use but to contrast it.</p>
<p>We wouldn't choose though here.</p>
<p>It's very subtle, the difference.</p>
<p>Yes, I think you could, you know, your parents usually come, though I don't, I guess you could certainly, it wouldn't be wrong though, right, Aubrey, to say though in that case?</p>
<p>It's interesting how I feel like there is a subtle meaning change.</p>
<p>I think if you said, though I don't think I've seen you, it would sort of be like judging, like criticizing.</p>
<p>Like, hmm, haven't seen you at these before, just because it's emphasizing the contrast.</p>
<p>Interesting, interesting.</p>
<p>And then you said,</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>And then you said, I know, it's the first time I've been able to attend.</p>
<p>Something always comes up, but this time I was like, I'm going.</p>
<p>No ifs, ands, or buts.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So we have but as a conjunction in the sentence, right?</p>
<p>Something always comes up, but this time.</p>
<p>And then we use that fun expression.</p>
<p>I was like, I'm going.</p>
<p>No ifs, ands, or buts.</p>
<p>This means I'm not going to allow any excuse to stand in my way.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And then I said, that's what my mom said to me when I told her I had to work.</p>
<p>And she said, no buts.</p>
<p>You know, you're going.</p>
<p>It's a shortened version of the first one.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>My mom said this a lot.</p>
<p>She's like, nope, I won't accept any excuses.</p>
<p>No buts.</p>
<p>It's like just shortening no ifs, ands, or buts.</p>
<p>Yeah, just laying down the law.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Good stuff.</p>
<p>So Aubrey, what's our takeaway for today?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think this is such a fun connection skill to playfully refuse to accept a no to an invitation.</p>
<p>What you're really saying is I really want you there, right?</p>
<p>You're trying to let them</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>trying to let them know in a playful way, right?</p>
<p>No excuses, like we want you to be there.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Meaning you're welcome.</p>
<p>We enjoy your company, right?</p>
<p>That's really what you're saying.</p>
<p>And I like how in this episode, Aubrey, we touched on the use of though as kind of a hanging, like a little break where you can hang out in that word, extend it and keep thinking as you're formulating your response, the contrast in the statement.</p>
<p>It's pretty cool.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>It's really interesting.</p>
<p>This is very subtle how the conjunction you choose kind of does change your meaning and it is subtle, right?</p>
<p>Nothing to stress about.</p>
<p>But often as we're speaking, we choose which one we want depending on how much we want to emphasize the function of the sentence, the contrast in this case.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
