<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p id="p-9">How can you articulate when a business or a company does something especially well?</p>
<p id="p-10">Today, get a new term to talk about special abilities and qualities with native speakers.</p>
<p id="p-11">Hello, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-12">How's it going today?</p>
<p id="p-13">I'm great, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-14">How are you?</p>
<p id="p-15">Good, but I have a great question for you today.</p>
<p id="p-16">You ready?</p>
<p id="p-17">Yes, Let's hear it.</p>
<p id="p-18">All right.</p>
<p id="p-19">So what do you think when you hear the phrase, the secret's in the sauce?</p>
<p id="p-20">Oh, man.</p>
<p id="p-21">I think of Fried Green Tomatoes.</p>
<p id="p-22">This was one of my favorite movies as a kid.</p>
<p id="p-23">I haven't seen it in a while, but I'm sure it holds up.</p>
<p id="p-24">Have you seen that film, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-25">Of course I have.</p>
<p id="p-26">It's one of my top favorite movie.</p>
<p id="p-27">It probably is in my top three favorite movies of all time.</p>
<p id="p-28">It's fantastic.</p>
<p id="p-29">If anyone out there, if you haven't heard of the film, Fried Green Tomatoes, right after you finish this episode, go watch it.</p>
<p id="p-30">Hopefully, it's available on streaming somewhere.</p>
<p id="p-31">It is so excellent.</p>
<p id="p-32">And there is a part where we're not going to tell you why.</p>
<p id="p-33">You have to watch the movie so we don't spoil anything, but they say the secret's in the</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-34">anything, but they say the secret's in the sauce, and you have to watch the film to find out why.</p>
<p id="p-35">It's definitely a twist in the movie, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-36">So go and check that out.</p>
<p id="p-37">Today's episode is inspired by a question from a listener in Instagram, right, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-38">Would you like to read the listener's question?</p>
<p id="p-39">Yes, This was from Anastasia Stacey, who said, Hi, do you think you can make an episode about the following expressions, secret sauce, and a diamond in the rough?</p>
<p id="p-40">So we actually did talk about diamond in the rough recently on an episode.</p>
<p id="p-41">It was you and Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-42">So stay until the end.</p>
<p id="p-43">We'll give you that episode number so you can check that out, all about that expression.</p>
<p id="p-44">Yes, We'll let you know where to go at the end of the episode.</p>
<p id="p-45">But for now, let's hunker down here and talk about, you know, secret sauce and special sauce, right?</p>
<p id="p-46">So we're going to start with special sauce.</p>
<p id="p-47">Tell us about this.</p>
<p id="p-48">Yeah, So we use this two different ways.</p>
<p id="p-49">The first way is about cooking usually, right?</p>
<p id="p-50">It's a sauce that adds an important element to</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-51">that adds an important element to a dish that has ingredients that are typically kept secret.</p>
<p id="p-52">I think of Raising Cane's. Do you have Raising Cane's where you live?</p>
<p id="p-53">They have this like fry sauce.</p>
<p id="p-54">I looked up a copycat recipe and the secret ingredient I think is Worcestershire sauce, which is funny.</p>
<p id="p-55">People say this differently in the U.S. Sometimes they say like Worcestershire sauce.</p>
<p id="p-56">But that I think is the secret ingredient.</p>
<p id="p-57">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-58">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-59">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-60">So here's some sample sentences.</p>
<p id="p-61">My grandma created a special sauce for her cinnamon rolls.</p>
<p id="p-62">That sounds delicious, right?</p>
<p id="p-63">So this is like the frosting on top.</p>
<p id="p-64">Who knows what she puts in it?</p>
<p id="p-65">Maybe molasses or honey.</p>
<p id="p-66">And if it's a special sauce, she maybe keeps it secret, right?</p>
<p id="p-67">You might ask her for the recipe and she might say, Nope, that's my secret.</p>
<p id="p-68">Right?</p>
<p id="p-69">Right, And then sometimes these recipes get passed down among families when someone, you know, they leave a cookbook and it gets passed down within the family, right?</p>
<p id="p-70">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-71">Yes, Very often.</p>
<p id="p-72">Or you might say the diner is known for the special sauce they put on.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-73">known for the special sauce they put on all their sandwiches.</p>
<p id="p-74">And this same thing, you would be like, I don't know what's in this, some kind of aioli.</p>
<p id="p-75">It's delicious.</p>
<p id="p-76">But it's good.</p>
<p id="p-77">Yeah, And then restaurants will try to guard that recipe, right?</p>
<p id="p-78">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-79">Yeah, I worked for a restaurant here called Cafe Rio.</p>
<p id="p-80">It has franchised since, so you've maybe eaten there.</p>
<p id="p-81">Oh, nice.</p>
<p id="p-82">And they make their pork.</p>
<p id="p-83">They marinate it in Coca-Cola and brown sugar.</p>
<p id="p-84">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-85">It's delicious.</p>
<p id="p-86">Are you supposed to share that?</p>
<p id="p-87">I can't tell you numbers.</p>
<p id="p-88">I never knew them, right?</p>
<p id="p-89">But I would watch them fill the thing with Coca-Cola and go put it in the pork.</p>
<p id="p-90">And I think they tell people that, but that was their secret ingredient.</p>
<p id="p-91">It was Coca-Cola for the sweetener.</p>
<p id="p-92">Yeah, I mean, I know a lot of places will put their sausage in beer or marinate things in beer, that sort of thing.</p>
<p id="p-93">So the more unique you get, I mean, you just have to have a good chef who is willing to experiment.</p>
<p id="p-94">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-95">Right, And they can come up with all kinds of interesting flavors by adding to things.</p>
<p id="p-96">But we also use special sauce, totally unrelated to Coca-Cola.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-97">sauce, totally unrelated to cooking, to talk about people's qualities.</p>
<p id="p-98">Maybe this is like an ability or a practice that makes someone or something more successful or more unique and distinctive.</p>
<p id="p-99">Yes, So for example, I've been impressed with the leadership at this company.</p>
<p id="p-100">They have a special sauce of making team members feel valued.</p>
<p id="p-101">So it could just be a team value, like a company value, the things that matter to that company and the people in that company, and it kind of emanates out to all the people.</p>
<p id="p-102">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-103">Right?</p>
<p id="p-104">And we'll call this a special sauce.</p>
<p id="p-105">It'd be like, oh, the leadership at that company is amazing.</p>
<p id="p-106">That's clearly their special sauce.</p>
<p id="p-107">Yes, And you're just sort of saying like there's something that they're doing that's working, that's really unique, and just call it a special sauce.</p>
<p id="p-108">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-109">Or we could talk about software.</p>
<p id="p-110">So for example, this software's special sauce is how well it integrates with social media.</p>
<p id="p-111">Yeah, So I mean... That means like it's quality, right?</p>
<p id="p-112">It's some kind of element about it that is really...</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-113">element about it that is really making it work, is really making it successful.</p>
<p id="p-114">I mean, I think most companies do need to develop this.</p>
<p id="p-115">Most companies, for better or for worse, some do it better than others, but they need to develop what they call a unique mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-116">The way they teach something, the way they build something that is different from other companies, but some, it's more effective for some companies than others, I would say.</p>
<p id="p-117">For sure, something that makes them stand out and makes them distinctive, that's really what leads to success when you really have your niche.</p>
<p id="p-118">Yes, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-119">Okay, so now let's go into secret sauce, yeah?</p>
<p id="p-120">Yes, and this, I feel like it's pretty interchangeable.</p>
<p id="p-121">There's maybe a slight difference here where someone might be even more secretive about this.</p>
<p id="p-122">So if you're talking about, you say the diner is known for the secret sauce they put on their sandwiches, this is definitely implying that don't ask for the recipe because it's a secret.</p>
<p id="p-123">Yeah, and I think just to call out what we talked about at the top of the show, this could get confusing for our listeners because the quote-</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-124">confusing for our listeners because the quote from the movie is, the secret's in the sauce.</p>
<p id="p-125">And so it's a little bit, it could also be a secret sauce and it probably is, you know, it was a soup, right?</p>
<p id="p-126">Is that what it was?</p>
<p id="p-127">Yeah, Or like a barbecue sauce, something like that.</p>
<p id="p-128">Right, it's a sauce.</p>
<p id="p-129">But it's also, I just want to show the difference between the two phrases here.</p>
<p id="p-130">Yeah, good point, right?</p>
<p id="p-131">So you, you kind of can say this two different ways, right?</p>
<p id="p-132">That the secret's in the sauce, it is in the sauce.</p>
<p id="p-133">And then we use this more like an adjective, secret sauce.</p>
<p id="p-134">Yes, And they essentially mean the same thing.</p>
<p id="p-135">Yeah, Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-136">And same with like software or companies or employees, right?</p>
<p id="p-137">You could say the software's secret sauce is how well it integrates with social media.</p>
<p id="p-138">Same meaning it's really pretty interchangeable.</p>
<p id="p-139">You're just saying there's something really special and distinctive about it.</p>
<p id="p-140">And this, in this case, it's how it integrates with social media.</p>
<p id="p-141">Yes, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-142">And then, so some sample sentences for secret sauce, the diner is known for the secret sauce they put on all their sandwiches.</p>
<p id="p-143">Okay.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-144">their sandwiches.</p>
<p id="p-145">Okay, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-146">And just that little the tiny difference of it's more secretive, right?</p>
<p id="p-147">Yeah, likely to and I think you could you can say special sauce, secret sauce.</p>
<p id="p-148">The main reason they would say secret sauce is if it's more of a family secret or a trade secret, right?</p>
<p id="p-149">It's something they actively protect, right?</p>
<p id="p-150">Right, They will not share it.</p>
<p id="p-151">But the special sauce could just be, hey, we make this all the time.</p>
<p id="p-152">It's why our sandwiches are good.</p>
<p id="p-153">It's not a secret.</p>
<p id="p-154">You can have the recipe if you want, but we do it here.</p>
<p id="p-155">Right?</p>
<p id="p-156">Yeah, And I think something interesting to think about is that everyone has a secret sauce or a special sauce, right?</p>
<p id="p-157">So everyone out there listening, there's something about you that makes you unique and distinctive, something special.</p>
<p id="p-158">So we got all figure out what that is and look for it in others, right?</p>
<p id="p-159">What a great thing to connect about.</p>
<p id="p-160">Yeah, I mean, and we can I mean, this brings up a bigger conversation, but I love this topic.</p>
<p id="p-161">I mean, we can get to this through assessments like StrengthsFinder, looking at our unique ability, our unique genius, there are lots of assessments and self-inquiry.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-162">there are lots of assessments and self inquiries that we can do.</p>
<p id="p-163">We can go on that journey and figure out what it is that we value, what it is that we do well, right?</p>
<p id="p-164">Yes, Figure out our strengths and our secret sauce.</p>
<p id="p-165">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-166">Yes, Yes, Okay, Aubrey, let's dive into a role play.</p>
<p id="p-167">And here we are working in a restaurant.</p>
<p id="p-168">Yeah, I'll start us off.</p>
<p id="p-169">Difficult.</p>
<p id="p-170">Yes, Yes, Do you know what's in this special sauce?</p>
<p id="p-171">Everyone loves it.</p>
<p id="p-172">No, they've kept the recipe secret.</p>
<p id="p-173">I'm dying to know what's in it.</p>
<p id="p-174">Well, the chef's secret sauce is making amazing meals, I guess, because this place has been packed since it opened.</p>
<p id="p-175">We can take some credit too.</p>
<p id="p-176">I've seen a lot of great reviews about the service.</p>
<p id="p-177">I guess you're right.</p>
<p id="p-178">Our secret sauce is excellent service.</p>
<p id="p-179">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-180">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-181">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-182">It's true.</p>
<p id="p-183">It's a good conversation that restaurants have to have with their management level and decide what do we do better.</p>
<p id="p-184">There's one restaurant that used to exist in Boston called Durgan Park.</p>
<p id="p-185">Have you ever heard of this?</p>
<p id="p-186">No.</p>
<p id="p-187">Durgan Park, where they're trading-</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-188">this Durgan Park, where their trademark, their secret sauce was that they would be really rude to customers in a jokey way.</p>
<p id="p-189">They would actually not scream at you, but kind of tease you based on what you've ordered.</p>
<p id="p-190">And that was their secret sauce.</p>
<p id="p-191">They trained people on that.</p>
<p id="p-192">People would go to get ridiculed?</p>
<p id="p-193">Yeah, And Boston can be sort of a rude... People can be a little abrasive there.</p>
<p id="p-194">So it kind of worked in Boston.</p>
<p id="p-195">I could see that.</p>
<p id="p-196">It would be entertaining.</p>
<p id="p-197">You never know what you're going to expect.</p>
<p id="p-198">Yeah, Unfortunately, it closed.</p>
<p id="p-199">So sad.</p>
<p id="p-200">So much personality.</p>
<p id="p-201">But anyways... Bummer.</p>
<p id="p-202">Yeah, All right.</p>
<p id="p-203">Well, let's go through this.</p>
<p id="p-204">I first said, do you know what's in this special sauce?</p>
<p id="p-205">So it's some kind of sauce that maybe they're putting on sandwiches.</p>
<p id="p-206">Everyone clearly loves it.</p>
<p id="p-207">Yes, Perfect.</p>
<p id="p-208">And then I said, no, they've kept it a secret.</p>
<p id="p-209">And then you said, well, the chef's secret sauce is making amazing meals.</p>
<p id="p-210">So now I'm going more broadly.</p>
<p id="p-211">I'm that is his secret skill or his special, unique ability in a way.</p>
<p id="p-212">Yes, And this would be a kind of a fun way</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-213">Yes, And this would be a kind of a fun way to play on words.</p>
<p id="p-214">If you're already talking about a secret sauce, a special sauce, a literal one at a restaurant, then to be like, well, the chef's secret sauce is creating these amazing meals.</p>
<p id="p-215">And now we're using it in this more idiomatic way of saying this is his special talent.</p>
<p id="p-216">Yeah, that's a really creative way to take that term and bring it out into a bigger conversation about people, which is kind of more interesting in a way.</p>
<p id="p-217">Right, Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-218">Right, Just talk about someone having a secret sauce.</p>
<p id="p-219">Their secret sauce is something they do well.</p>
<p id="p-220">Yes, totally.</p>
<p id="p-221">And then at the end, you said, Aubrey, what'd you say?</p>
<p id="p-222">You said our secret sauce is excellent service.</p>
<p id="p-223">We were talking about the good reviews and we're giving ourselves a pat on the back here.</p>
<p id="p-224">Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-225">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-226">So good.</p>
<p id="p-227">And I love, again, how we've brought that out to talk about personality.</p>
<p id="p-228">So I think, you know, the call to action for our listeners today will be to dig into what is your secret sauce, right?</p>
<p id="p-229">Check out some of the tools that we mentioned earlier and dig into that because we all do have one.</p>
<p id="p-230">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-231">Right, Find out.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-232">Absolutely, right?</p>
<p id="p-233">Find out your strengths and then you can use them to be successful at work and in life.</p>
<p id="p-234">And we did promise to share the recent episode where you guys talked about the phrase diamond in the rough.</p>
<p id="p-235">What was that, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-236">Yes, Yeah, that was 2169, Pearls of English Wisdom.</p>
<p id="p-237">I love that title.</p>
<p id="p-238">Yes, so good.</p>
<p id="p-239">Secret sauce is titling.</p>
<p id="p-240">No, just kidding.</p>
<p id="p-241">So check out that episode.</p>
<p id="p-242">We went pretty deep into this concept.</p>
<p id="p-243">And then you and I did a episode on diamonds too, the diamond industry.</p>
<p id="p-244">That was interesting.</p>
<p id="p-245">Yeah, So you guys talked about that actual idiom, diamond in the rough on that one.</p>
<p id="p-246">But Lindsay and I did an episode about diamond mining and sort of the controversy behind that.</p>
<p id="p-247">So if you missed that, maybe just search a diamond on the website and you'll find them all.</p>
<p id="p-248">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-249">Just come back to AllEarsEnglish.com and type that in.</p>
<p id="p-250">And I guess a final thought would be not just taking that step of figuring out what your secret sauce is, but learning how to articulate it.</p>
<p id="p-251">Because it's only half the battle if we know what it is.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-252">the battle if we know what it is, but we want to articulate this to our boss at work and to our co-workers and to our families and our friends so we have more opportunities to use our secret sauce.</p>
<p id="p-253">Right, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-254">Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-255">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-256">And to find out what is the secret sauce of those you know and work with because what a great way to connect.</p>
<p id="p-257">And also, you'll be able to be more successful working together if you know their strengths as well.</p>
<p id="p-258">Yeah, maybe we'll have to do an episode.</p>
<p id="p-259">I'm not sure if we've done an episode on that on how to introduce your unique skills and talents, how to talk about what you do better than the average person.</p>
<p id="p-260">And how to do it without bragging or without seeming like you're just overtly bragging because sometimes we need to do this in a way that's a little more humble.</p>
<p id="p-261">Yeah, so we're going to do that in another episode.</p>
