<p id="p-20">How's it going today?</p>
<p id="p-21">I'm good, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-22">I have a question for you.</p>
<p id="p-23">All right.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-24">question for you.</p>
<p id="p-25">All right, I'm ready.</p>
<p id="p-26">What would you say is a typical lifespan of a car?</p>
<p id="p-27">It really depends on what car you have, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-28">I mean, we have an old Toyota and at this point we're going to drive her.</p>
<p id="p-29">She's a female and we're going to take her all the way to 300,000 miles.</p>
<p id="p-30">That's what we've said.</p>
<p id="p-31">And she is 20 years old, actually.</p>
<p id="p-32">So yeah, it's an old Toyota 4Runner.</p>
<p id="p-33">2005 or 2006.</p>
<p id="p-34">But that's the best I think you can really expect.</p>
<p id="p-35">It's funny.</p>
<p id="p-36">You can get attached to your car, right?</p>
<p id="p-37">You can.</p>
<p id="p-38">I guess so.</p>
<p id="p-39">Yeah, you can.</p>
<p id="p-40">Are you attached to your car?</p>
<p id="p-41">No, my car needs to be cleaned.</p>
<p id="p-42">But I'm not attached to it yet.</p>
<p id="p-43">But I remember very specifically when we got rid of we had one of those station wagons when I was a kid.</p>
<p id="p-44">I remember when my mom was going to she was going to drop that.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-45">Mom was going to, she was going to drop that car off and she was going to get her new car.</p>
<p id="p-46">And I remember it was sad.</p>
<p id="p-47">We were all kind of sad.</p>
<p id="p-48">Totally.</p>
<p id="p-49">I think it's a thing when you're a kid because you associate your car with family trips, memories, your parents.</p>
<p id="p-50">A lot of times, yeah, kids do.</p>
<p id="p-51">I also got attached to our family cars.</p>
<p id="p-52">It's sort of a weird thing.</p>
<p id="p-53">Why did you ask me about the lifespan of a car?</p>
<p id="p-54">Oh, no, I'm just kidding.</p>
<p id="p-55">Mechanical knowledge today or what?</p>
<p id="p-56">God, no.</p>
<p id="p-57">God, no.</p>
<p id="p-58">Today we are going to be answering a listener question about the word lifespan.</p>
<p id="p-59">So we're going to focus on part of this listener's question today about the word lifespan.</p>
<p id="p-60">But before we do that, guys, remember to hit follow wherever you listen to All Ears English so you never miss anything from us.</p>

<p id="p-69">Because we love it when we can base our episodes on listener questions.</p>
<p id="p-70">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-71">Yeah, Actually, we're just talking about how we've gotten some really good questions recently.</p>
<p id="p-72">Lindsay, do you want me to read the question this time?</p>
<p id="p-73">That'd be great, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-74">Could you do that for us?</p>
<p id="p-75">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-76">So unfortunately, I don't think that I have the name of this listener, but it said, greetings.</p>
<p id="p-77">I really enjoy listening to your podcast.</p>
<p id="p-78">It's been so helpful for improving my English.</p>
<p id="p-79">Does lifespan apply only to living things or can it be used for objects or ideas too?</p>
<p id="p-80">Thank you so much for your help.</p>
<p id="p-81">Looking forward to your next episode.</p>
<p id="p-82">Thank you so much.</p>
<p id="p-83">And it looks like this person gave us a five-star review.</p>
<p id="p-84">Lindsay, I don't know if you can find, if you know their name.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-85">You can find if you know their name.</p>
<p id="p-86">Yeah, I don't know their name.</p>
<p id="p-87">But thank you to the listener.</p>
<p id="p-88">We love good questions.</p>
<p id="p-89">You can leave your question in your review wherever you listen, or you can send your question over to support at allearsenglish.com.</p>
<p id="p-90">Those are great ways to get your question into our queue and make sure it's a specific question.</p>
<p id="p-91">Right?</p>
<p id="p-92">Yes, OK, so thank you so much.</p>
<p id="p-93">Lindsay, so what did I ask you first, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-94">We were talking about a car, right?</p>
<p id="p-95">Is a car a living thing?</p>
<p id="p-96">Well, it's not, although I made it sound like it is by giving it a gender.</p>
<p id="p-97">But sometimes we do that.</p>
<p id="p-98">That's another story for another day.</p>
<p id="p-99">But yeah, it's not a living thing, but it does have a lifespan, meaning the amount of time in which it's functional, that you're still driving it, right?</p>
<p id="p-100">Right, right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-101">So it is interesting that we can use lifespan about living or non-living things.</p>
<p id="p-102">Yes, But this listener asked also about objects or ideas.</p>
<p id="p-103">So for ideas...</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-104">So ideas, I don't really think so.</p>
<p id="p-105">To me, it's more about living things or objects.</p>
<p id="p-106">What do you think?</p>
<p id="p-107">Yeah, I really don't think I would say that for an idea having a lifespan.</p>
<p id="p-108">I would say maybe like a trend could have kind of a lifespan.</p>
<p id="p-109">A trend, like a way of thinking, a wave of thinking.</p>
<p id="p-110">Maybe you could say that movement had a lifespan.</p>
<p id="p-111">Would you say that?</p>
<p id="p-112">Maybe.</p>
<p id="p-113">Maybe.</p>
<p id="p-114">It doesn't feel very natural to me.</p>
<p id="p-115">It doesn't feel very natural, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-116">There's other words that we could use for ideas that would be better, I think.</p>
<p id="p-117">Right, I'm thinking about, well, would you say it about maybe a trend, like, oh, the lifespan of the skinny jeans trend or something like that?</p>
<p id="p-118">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-119">Still, it feels... Yeah, I mean, it doesn't feel 100% natural, but I think if you said it, people would get it.</p>
<p id="p-120">No, I mean, right.</p>
<p id="p-121">Yeah, exactly, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-122">Yeah, so to me, the word, you know, lifespan can sound actually a little bit scientific, right?</p>
<p id="p-123">Yeah, it does.</p>
<p id="p-124">It's really about the time something lasts, right?</p>
<p id="p-125">So the focus is...</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-126">time something lasts, right?</p>
<p id="p-127">So the focus is on time.</p>
<p id="p-128">So let's do some examples.</p>
<p id="p-129">Lindsay, you want to do the first one?</p>
<p id="p-130">Yes, The average lifespan of a dog is 10 to 13 years, which is way too short.</p>
<p id="p-131">When I think about that, I think Kiefer's halfway through his life.</p>
<p id="p-132">He's middle-aged.</p>
<p id="p-133">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-134">I know.</p>
<p id="p-135">I know.</p>
<p id="p-136">I just saw something about them trying to make dogs live longer.</p>
<p id="p-137">Did you see?</p>
<p id="p-138">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-139">I saw that.</p>
<p id="p-140">I swear I saw something.</p>
<p id="p-141">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-142">Maybe I'd had a dream about it.</p>
<p id="p-143">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-144">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-145">All right, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-146">The lifespan of the carpets we sell is about 20 years.</p>
<p id="p-147">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-148">Or you should exercise, sleep, and eat healthy if you want to increase your lifespan.</p>
<p id="p-149">So yeah, we haven't mentioned this yet, but the major way that this is used is actually about the human body, a life, someone's life.</p>
<p id="p-150">Like how long are you going to live?</p>
<p id="p-151">Your lifespan.</p>
<p id="p-152">Yeah, Right, Average lifespan of, you know, like, for example, women tends to be longer than men in general, I think, across the world.</p>
<p id="p-153">And then lifespan can also vary based on</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-154">Lifespan can also vary based on where you're from, what country you live in, right?</p>
<p id="p-155">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-156">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-157">So, or here's another one.</p>
<p id="p-158">Make sure you, back to cars, make sure you get regular oil changes in order to maintain the lifespan of the car.</p>
<p id="p-159">Yes, Nice.</p>
<p id="p-160">Yeah, So let's talk about what we do to try to increase our lifespan.</p>
<p id="p-161">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-162">Michelle, anything that comes to mind for you in terms of daily habits or activities?</p>
<p id="p-163">I've been trying to exercise more.</p>
<p id="p-164">I've recently picked it up again.</p>
<p id="p-165">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-166">So I would say that's important.</p>
<p id="p-167">I think now, I don't know if you are into this, but now I've been really considering what I eat and the amount of plastic that I use.</p>
<p id="p-168">I was having a lot of plastic water bottles.</p>
<p id="p-169">I've been starting to become more aware of, I think this is happening to a lot of people I know.</p>
<p id="p-170">They're starting to think about plastic they use.</p>
<p id="p-171">I just bought new stainless steel</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-172">I just bought new stainless steel containers for my kids' snacks.</p>
<p id="p-173">So I would say that's something I'm starting to consider.</p>
<p id="p-174">Also, I think about, you know, I do like the idea of eating fewer chemicals.</p>
<p id="p-175">So I'm starting to consider really what I put in my body and maybe eating less meat, more vegetables.</p>
<p id="p-176">So I would say that that's been my focus more so recently.</p>
<p id="p-177">And then it's also about what you don't do, right?</p>
<p id="p-178">You know, like I don't smoke, you know, certain things like that.</p>
<p id="p-179">For sure, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-180">What about you?</p>
<p id="p-181">Well, I think there's just a lot more research coming out now about nutrition and ultra processed foods.</p>
<p id="p-182">And I'm all about inflammation, anti-inflammatory stuff, like, you know, the food that can bring down your inflammation in your body, right?</p>
<p id="p-183">Like omega-3s and cherries and fruits and like strong polyphenols, that kind of thing.</p>
<p id="p-184">I really nerd out on this stuff, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-185">I really do.</p>
<p id="p-186">No, me too, recently.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-187">No, me too.</p>
<p id="p-188">Recently I've been getting into it.</p>
<p id="p-189">I don't know, maybe it's just something that happens.</p>
<p id="p-190">It's a trend right now.</p>
<p id="p-191">I think people are talking a lot.</p>
<p id="p-192">We're really raising the consciousness, especially around processed foods.</p>
<p id="p-193">It's true.</p>
<p id="p-194">And also dyes, that's a new thing.</p>
<p id="p-195">Oh, yeah, interesting.</p>
<p id="p-196">Right, yeah, if you have to put dye and food coloring into your food, something's probably wrong, right?</p>
<p id="p-197">I think one of the red dyes was just banned.</p>
<p id="p-198">It's going to be banned.</p>
<p id="p-199">Oh, was it?</p>
<p id="p-200">Yeah, yeah, that was big news.</p>
<p id="p-201">So anyway, trying to increase our lifespans.</p>
<p id="p-202">Yeah, so I think the main way we use the word lifespan, probably 60% of the time, it is about the human life, right?</p>
<p id="p-203">Broadly about human beings and then in different parts of the world and ages and genders and that kind of thing.</p>
<p id="p-204">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-205">Okay, Michelle, so there are other ways that we could say lifespan that might actually be better for what we talked about, the lifespan of a trend, right?</p>
<p id="p-206">If we want to talk about trends or ideas, there might be better ways to say that.</p>
<p id="p-207">Let's see if we can explore here.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-208">Let's see if we can explore here.</p>
<p id="p-209">All right.</p>
<p id="p-210">Well, we're going to explore some similar ideas.</p>
<p id="p-211">So the first one is duration.</p>
<p id="p-212">So this is more used for objects, right?</p>
<p id="p-213">I wouldn't talk about a person's duration.</p>
<p id="p-214">That would be very weird.</p>
<p id="p-215">It makes it feel too objectified, the person, right?</p>
<p id="p-216">Yeah, So you can increase the duration of your clothes by washing them according to the instructions on the tag.</p>
<p id="p-217">Yeah, The duration of your clothes.</p>
<p id="p-218">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-219">I've never used that for clothes, but I guess you could.</p>
<p id="p-220">Yeah, Am I making that up?</p>
<p id="p-221">I mean, it's a new book, right?</p>
<p id="p-222">Yeah, sure.</p>
<p id="p-223">Yeah, I don't see why not.</p>
<p id="p-224">I mean, how long your clothes... I mean, Lindsay, I think we've talked about this.</p>
<p id="p-225">Neither you or I really wash our laundry correctly.</p>
<p id="p-226">Is that right?</p>
<p id="p-227">Oh, no, no, no.</p>
<p id="p-228">Never.</p>
<p id="p-229">Never.</p>
<p id="p-230">I just don't have the time or the energy to separate my whites and my darks.</p>
<p id="p-231">And I often wash my jeans, which you're not supposed to.</p>
<p id="p-232">I know.</p>
<p id="p-233">I commit all that.</p>
<p id="p-234">I know.</p>
<p id="p-235">Next one is life cycle.</p>
<p id="p-236">So slightly more about the actual circle of life.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-237">of the actual circle of life, like the Lion King.</p>
<p id="p-238">Shout out to the Lion King.</p>
<p id="p-239">We love it.</p>
<p id="p-240">It's a good one.</p>
<p id="p-241">The life cycle of something.</p>
<p id="p-242">This kind of talks about changes that things go through throughout their life too, right?</p>
<p id="p-243">So lifespan is about amount of time.</p>
<p id="p-244">Life cycle is about stages, usually.</p>
<p id="p-245">So today we will learn about the life cycle of a butterfly.</p>
<p id="p-246">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-247">Yeah, perfect.</p>
<p id="p-248">What else, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-249">Life expectancy.</p>
<p id="p-250">So again, these are similar words.</p>
<p id="p-251">They're words in the same vein, but they're not exactly the same.</p>
<p id="p-252">Life expectancy.</p>
<p id="p-253">So that's how long something will live.</p>
<p id="p-254">Now, would you use life expectancy for an object?</p>
<p id="p-255">Would you use life expectancy for an object?</p>
<p id="p-256">No, probably not.</p>
<p id="p-257">I feel like you have to be alive.</p>
<p id="p-258">Don't you think?</p>
<p id="p-259">You know, more commonly, that's how you would use it.</p>
<p id="p-260">But I do think that, like, for example, the life expectancy of a phone...</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-261">The life expectancy of a phone is probably about four years, but it may not work that well even before then.</p>
<p id="p-262">I feel like that sounds, do you think that sounds natural or a little weird?</p>
<p id="p-263">The life expectancy, it feels a little weird to me because when I think about, again, when I think about life expectancy, I think about like human beings.</p>
<p id="p-264">You know what I mean?</p>
<p id="p-265">Kind of.</p>
<p id="p-266">Yeah, How long someone will live.</p>
<p id="p-267">So I would generally advise to stay more around things, you know, around humans.</p>
<p id="p-268">But this actually leads me to a more interesting question, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-269">Oh, life expectancy around the world, countries.</p>
<p id="p-270">Yeah, Ooh, do you know how low the US is?</p>
<p id="p-271">We're pretty low, aren't we?</p>
<p id="p-272">We're very low.</p>
<p id="p-273">What is that?</p>
<p id="p-274">So I'm looking at one source and I want to encourage our listeners to go and research this.</p>
<p id="p-275">But I had heard this before.</p>
<p id="p-276">Based on this source, worldometers.info, it looks like we're number 48.</p>
<p id="p-277">Ooh.</p>
<p id="p-278">Very low.</p>
<p id="p-279">Who takes the cake?</p>
<p id="p-280">Japan?</p>
<p id="p-281">Hong Kong.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-282">Japan, Hong Kong, the top.</p>
<p id="p-283">This must be something about the diet in Asia.</p>
<p id="p-284">So number one, Hong Kong, two, Japan, three, South Korea, four, French Polynesia.</p>
<p id="p-285">Very interesting.</p>
<p id="p-286">So I would love to know what our listeners think about what determines lifespan.</p>
<p id="p-287">Like what's the secret of being at the top of this chart?</p>
<p id="p-288">What do you think it is, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-289">I think it might be what you eat.</p>
<p id="p-290">What do you think?</p>
<p id="p-291">Well, I have a feeling it's a combination between what you eat and how often you move.</p>
<p id="p-292">Yeah, yep.</p>
<p id="p-293">Yeah, because I remember when I lived in Japan and again, on this chart, Japan is number two, and I would want to validate this against other charts, but I remember how much I moved just walking to the train all the time.</p>
<p id="p-294">I didn't really drive.</p>
<p id="p-295">Trains cover the whole country.</p>
<p id="p-296">It's just amazing the amount of walking I did.</p>
<p id="p-297">So I want to hear from our listeners on that, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-298">Maybe we could do a follow-up on this idea of lifespan across the world.</p>
<p id="p-299">It's so important.</p>
<p id="p-300">Yeah, Yeah, that would be interesting.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-301">Yeah, that would be interesting.</p>
<p id="p-302">Okay, I'm going to look into that lifespan around the world.</p>
<p id="p-303">Lindsay, here's another question.</p>
<p id="p-304">Well, what's the longest time you think you've had a piece of technology?</p>
<p id="p-305">And what is it?</p>
<p id="p-306">Wow, that's a great question.</p>
<p id="p-307">Well, I actually had my last computer for quite a while.</p>
<p id="p-308">I had it for about five years and I just got a brand new one.</p>
<p id="p-309">Oh, you did get a new one, congrats.</p>
<p id="p-310">Yeah, shout out to Dell.</p>
<p id="p-311">It lasted me a long time.</p>
<p id="p-312">So the lifespan of that computer, yeah, I guess you could say lifespan of a computer.</p>
<p id="p-313">I think that makes sense to me.</p>
<p id="p-314">Yeah, yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-315">All right, guys, so now we are going to share results from a poll we did on Spotify.</p>
<p id="p-316">Guys, we've been doing these really fun polls on Spotify and this was from episode 2337 of All Ears English.</p>
<p id="p-317">This was called, why do Americans love bulk buying?</p>
<p id="p-318">So if you haven't, well, and maybe, hey, also connected to life</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-319">Hey, also connected to lifespan, what you're eating.</p>
<p id="p-320">This might be connected to why we're number 48.</p>
<p id="p-321">That's hilarious.</p>
<p id="p-322">I was not thinking about it at all that way.</p>
<p id="p-323">But yes.</p>
<p id="p-324">So head on over and listen to that episode.</p>
<p id="p-325">But what was the question on the poll for that?</p>
<p id="p-326">Yeah, the question was, you know, is Costco a big connection topic in your culture?</p>
<p id="p-327">So not necessarily are you a Costco shopper, but is it a connection topic?</p>
<p id="p-328">Do you talk about it?</p>
<p id="p-329">Are there jokes about Costco?</p>
<p id="p-330">Are there shared enthusiasm around the Costco idea, right?</p>
<p id="p-331">Yes or no?</p>
<p id="p-332">So it was an interesting even split, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-333">Yes was 52% and no was 47%. Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-334">Yeah, Yeah, Very interesting.</p>
<p id="p-335">Some Costco fans.</p>
<p id="p-336">Some Costco fans more than I actually thought, but it is a global concept now for sure.</p>
<p id="p-337">Should we go into a quick role play before we finish?</p>
<p id="p-338">Let's do it.</p>
<p id="p-339">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-340">So I am a salesman.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-341">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-342">So I am a salesman, and you are looking for a new couch.</p>
<p id="p-343">All right, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-344">All right, so how long do these couches typically last?</p>
<p id="p-345">Well, the duration is based on how they are treated, so you definitely want to use the cleaner every six months.</p>
<p id="p-346">So that increases the lifespan?</p>
<p id="p-347">Oh, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-348">The life expectancy is about five years if you aren't careful and 20 years if you are.</p>
<p id="p-349">Whoa, what a difference.</p>
<p id="p-350">Yeah, in the life cycle of a couch, the length of time really depends on how much you rough it up.</p>
<p id="p-351">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-352">Good to know, good to know.</p>
<p id="p-353">I didn't know that I had to use a special cleaner for my couch.</p>
<p id="p-354">Geez.</p>
<p id="p-355">Yeah, I'm learning a lot here.</p>
<p id="p-356">All right, well, the goal, though, is to not be on the couch too much, right?</p>
<p id="p-357">So we can be above higher than 48 on the list.</p>
<p id="p-358">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-359">So many connections we're making in this episode.</p>
<p id="p-360">Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-361">All right, let's break this down.</p>
<p id="p-362">So you said, well, the duration is based on how they are treated, right?</p>
<p id="p-363">So the duration of how long the couch...</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p id="p-364">How long the couch will last is based on how it's treated.</p>
<p id="p-365">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-366">And then I said, I use the cleaner every six months and you said, so that increases the lifespan?</p>
<p id="p-367">Perfect.</p>
<p id="p-368">And then you said, oh, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-369">The life expectancy is about five years if you aren't careful and 20 years if you are.</p>
<p id="p-370">And then I said, yeah, and the life cycle of a couch, the length of time really depends on how much you rough it up.</p>
<p id="p-371">So again, this is extreme, right?</p>
<p id="p-372">We're not going to use all of these in once.</p>
<p id="p-373">However, you know, another point is it's kind of silly, right?</p>
<p id="p-374">The life cycle of a couch.</p>
<p id="p-375">This is to me a point of having some fun with the language, right?</p>
<p id="p-376">We don't say the life cycle of a couch.</p>
<p id="p-377">Obviously the couch isn't living.</p>
<p id="p-378">It doesn't have, you know, we don't think of it as a butterfly or, you know, but it's not going to get married one day and like, you know, have like typical life cycle moments, but sometimes</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p id="p-379">have like typical life cycle moments, but sometimes we do things.</p>
<p id="p-380">We've talked about this before, personifying objects.</p>
<p id="p-381">We personify objects, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-382">Yeah, so this can happen.</p>
<p id="p-383">Right, Yeah, I mean, or like how I put a gender on my car right at the top of the episode.</p>
<p id="p-384">We do personify, maybe it's time to revisit that topic on All Ears English, Michelle, of personifying objects.</p>
<p id="p-385">Come back to that.</p>
<p id="p-386">We did an episode a long time ago.</p>
<p id="p-387">That would be kind of cool to come back to, don't you think?</p>
<p id="p-388">Right, yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-389">I do think so.</p>
<p id="p-390">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-391">And we're going to have a good poll.</p>
<p id="p-392">Maybe the poll today will be related to the lifespan around the world, life expectancy around the world.</p>
<p id="p-393">We're going to ask some kind of questions.</p>
<p id="p-394">So come over to Spotify and participate in the poll, guys.</p>
<p id="p-395">All right, good stuff.</p>
<p id="p-396">And don't forget to hit follow on All Ears English.</p>
<p id="p-397">Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-398">What's the takeaway for today?</p>
<p id="p-399">What do you think?</p>
<p id="p-400">Well, I mean, this is such a diverse topic.</p>
<p id="p-401">You can talk about anything from how long people live around the world to how long certain items will live or survive or last.</p>
<h2>Part-21</h2>
<p id="p-402">or survive or last, right?</p>
<p id="p-403">So just try to dive into trying one of the ways we talked about today and try it out.</p>
<p id="p-404">Just try it out, right?</p>
<p id="p-405">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-406">All right.</p>
