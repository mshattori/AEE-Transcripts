<p id="p-24">I guess it's you know Meditative or relaxing, right?</p>
<p id="p-25">Yeah, Yeah, that's that's the idea.</p>
<p id="p-26">I I got I I got on that trend When it first happened, but I think I colored two pages, I don't know Well, did it help for you?</p>
<p id="p-27">Was it?</p>
<p id="p-28">Relaxing a way of focusing the mind and resting at the point Yeah, I get the point, you know, cuz you're only focusing on those movements And so it's nice the other over Thanksgiving my sister-in-law loves to paint Oh wait to relax and so I never paint with her But then the other day she brought it out and we were just painting together and I thought it's kind of nice.</p>

<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-30">What a cool thing to be able to go to.</p>
<p id="p-31">Right?</p>
<p id="p-32">Well, she's a good artist.</p>
<p id="p-33">So amazing.</p>
<p id="p-34">Well, I'm excited.</p>
<p id="p-35">We're getting on into this topic of crayons and it's going to come out.</p>
<p id="p-36">Yes, it's got sort of in one way or another, but we are going to have a listener question today.</p>
<p id="p-37">This episode is based on a great listener question.</p>
<p id="p-38">So shall I read the question, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-39">Yes, please.</p>
<p id="p-40">All right.</p>
<p id="p-41">So our listener Sylvia has asked, Hello, Lindsay, Michelle, Jessica and Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-42">Thank you so much for your podcast and your efforts to teach us in such an entertaining way.</p>
<p id="p-43">I've been listening to your podcast and watching your videos on YouTube for about three weeks now.</p>
<p id="p-44">I try to listen to at least five episodes a day, so I still have a lot to catch up on.</p>
<p id="p-45">Well, welcome to our community, Sylvia.</p>
<p id="p-46">So great, Michelle, to have you.</p>
<p id="p-47">I'm glad you're already sending in a question.</p>
<p id="p-48">I know.</p>
<p id="p-49">That is such a good sign for this listener.</p>
<p id="p-50">Guys, make sure you send us your questions.</p>
<p id="p-51">Send them in to support at allearsenglish.com.</p>
<p id="p-52">We'll get them on our list.</p>
<p id="p-53">And if it's a good question, we'll answer it and read your name out loud on the show.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-54">out loud on the show.</p>
<p id="p-55">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-56">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-57">All right.</p>
<p id="p-58">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-59">All right.</p>
<p id="p-60">I have a question about an idiom.</p>
<p id="p-61">I'm not the brightest candle on the chandelier.</p>
<p id="p-62">I know there are variations, different variations of this expression.</p>
<p id="p-63">We use similar ones in German and Hungarian.</p>
<p id="p-64">English is my third language.</p>
<p id="p-65">In Hungarian, for example, we say not the sharpest knife in the drawer.</p>
<p id="p-66">What variations exist in English and how commonly are they used?</p>
<p id="p-67">Also, is this expression considered offensive or can it be taken with a wink and a smile?</p>
<p id="p-68">Thank you so much for your hard work and I wish you all the best moving forward.</p>
<p id="p-69">Best regards, Sylvia.</p>
<p id="p-70">Lovely.</p>
<p id="p-71">Lovely, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-72">Such a great and fun question.</p>
<p id="p-73">I was very excited to plan this one.</p>
<p id="p-74">So thank you so much.</p>
<p id="p-75">So this is interesting.</p>
<p id="p-76">So I think the main part of the question is at the end because we need to talk about this for sure.</p>
<p id="p-77">Sylvia asks, is this expression considered offensive or can it be taken with a wink and a smile?</p>
<p id="p-78">Yeah, So we're definitely going to talk about what.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-79">We're definitely going to talk about what the feeling is behind these types of expressions.</p>
<p id="p-80">But before we do that, we want to remind you guys to hit the follow button so you never miss anything from us.</p>
<p id="p-81">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-82">We have a lot of old episodes, past episodes, but we come out with five new episodes a week.</p>

<p id="p-84">Go ahead and hit that follow button so you can make All Ears English a part of your day.</p>
<p id="p-85">That's the key.</p>
<p id="p-86">That's how we get better.</p>
<p id="p-87">Right?</p>
<p id="p-88">Yes, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-89">What do you think?</p>
<p id="p-90">Is this offensive?</p>
<p id="p-91">I mean, I think, Michelle, essentially, yes.</p>
<p id="p-92">It's extremely offensive because you're saying that you're not smart, right?</p>
<p id="p-93">First of all, it depends on who we're saying it about.</p>
<p id="p-94">Are we saying it about ourselves?</p>
<p id="p-95">In that case, it can be okay.</p>
<p id="p-96">It can be acceptable.</p>
<p id="p-97">It's a self-deprecating way of connecting, really, connecting with others.</p>
<p id="p-98">Now, if you go and say it about someone else, there are shades of gray there, too.</p>
<p id="p-99">There are nuances, right, Michelle?</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-100">There are nuances, right Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-101">Right, We want to be careful.</p>
<p id="p-102">It could be offensive.</p>
<p id="p-103">Yeah, it could very well be offensive You would have to be using it with somebody, you know, pretty well very well.</p>
<p id="p-104">Yeah, and in a in a very kind of Funny way right not not seriously insulting them.</p>
<p id="p-105">So that's oh, yeah Yeah, so that that's that's basically what I would say, but so let's get let's get into it more So Sylvia says I'm not the brightest candle on the chandelier as the example.</p>
<p id="p-106">Have you heard that one that one?</p>
<p id="p-107">I don't think I've heard it in that exact way with those exact words I mean, we're saying the same thing across different cultures here, right?</p>
<p id="p-108">They're just variations of the same idiom, but I don't think we use that one.</p>
<p id="p-109">Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-110">Do you think I Don't hear this one as often when I was researching for the episode.</p>
<p id="p-111">I found it But to me, it's not one of the more common ones that we use So we're gonna talk about some of the common ones today.</p>
<p id="p-112">So the idea let's talk about</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-113">idea, let's talk about kind of the structure of this.</p>
<p id="p-114">It's, I'm not the, or someone is not the, something-ist, so an adjective-ist, noun in the noun.</p>
<p id="p-115">Noun in the noun.</p>
<p id="p-116">I'm not the something noun in the noun.</p>
<p id="p-117">Yes, There's the breakdown.</p>
<p id="p-118">Right, Okay.</p>
<p id="p-119">But we'll give a lot of examples.</p>
<p id="p-120">So you're saying something that comes in something else.</p>
<p id="p-121">So, or, or something that is on something else, like I guess the chandelier.</p>
<p id="p-122">So, I mean, the biggest one that I think about is this, what we talked about with the crayon.</p>
<p id="p-123">Lindsay, is that a common, can you say what that one is?</p>
<p id="p-124">Yeah, So this is, I'm not the brightest crayon in the box.</p>
<p id="p-125">Yeah, So essentially, I mean, technically you could even make up your own, which would be really clever, right?</p>
<p id="p-126">You could make up, you could, I mean, if you want to be really creative with language, you could, you could make up your own idiom in this context, as long as you understand the formula, right?</p>
<p id="p-127">Right,</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-128">formula.</p>
<p id="p-129">Right?</p>
<p id="p-130">Right, Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-131">So I'm not the brightest crayon in the box.</p>
<p id="p-132">Noun in the noun.</p>
<p id="p-133">Right, And that was interesting because that's kind of a double play on words because we also use the word bright to refer to intelligence.</p>
<p id="p-134">Right, So you're saying I'm not the the brightest color crayon in the box, but I'm also not the smartest.</p>
<p id="p-135">So that's that one is extra special.</p>
<p id="p-136">Yeah, that's true.</p>
<p id="p-137">That's a good point.</p>
<p id="p-138">Yeah, So yeah, if you and you know, if you use this on its own, it means you're not that smart.</p>
<p id="p-139">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-140">Yes, So what can be okay is if you use it by itself, or if you use it just with something else.</p>
<p id="p-141">So let me explain what I mean.</p>
<p id="p-142">I'm not the brightest crayon in the box when it comes to technology.</p>
<p id="p-143">So you can be specific, right?</p>
<p id="p-144">So if you add when it comes to that can be a good way to be specific.</p>
<p id="p-145">You're not just saying, I'm not bright.</p>
<p id="p-146">You're just</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-147">I'm not bright.</p>
<p id="p-148">Yeah, you're just saying right this isn't something that I know a lot about Yeah, we would recommend that exactly and it builds nuance to what you're saying.</p>
<p id="p-149">It builds context It makes people want to ask you a question.</p>
<p id="p-150">Well, maybe you're really into art if you're not into technology, right?</p>
<p id="p-151">They just gives people more to work with more to respond to.</p>
<p id="p-152">Okay, exactly So let's do some of the other ones.</p>
<p id="p-153">These are some of the other ones I've heard Lindsay and if you use them or not, we can talk through them.</p>
<p id="p-154">So what's the first one?</p>
<p id="p-155">All right, not the sharpest tool in the shed.</p>
<p id="p-156">I think this one is the one I've heard the most Yeah, I think this might also be on a song from the 90s if I'm not right.</p>
<p id="p-157">Yeah, I think so But anyways, what's the next one Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-158">Okay, not the sharpest tool in the shed.</p>
<p id="p-159">And now there's I found this one not the sharpest pencil in the cup Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-160">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-161">Also sharp sharp is You're right because right We could do another episode a follow-up episode here Michelle on ways to say intelligent bright sharp</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-162">to say intelligent, bright, sharp.</p>
<p id="p-163">There's a lot.</p>
<p id="p-164">I mean, we are a culture that hyper values intelligence, right?</p>
<p id="p-165">Hyper values conceptual cerebral intelligence, book smarts.</p>
<p id="p-166">And so we have a lot of words for that, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-167">Yeah, that would be a fun one, different ways to say smart.</p>
<p id="p-168">Yeah, interesting.</p>
<p id="p-169">Okay, and then there's also not the brightest bulb in the box, so that goes back to bright.</p>
<p id="p-170">Interesting, so I wonder if we advise our listeners to make up their own.</p>
<p id="p-171">I wonder if we have to use that double play on words when it comes to this idiom.</p>
<p id="p-172">Something has to be about like, so if it's lights and things being sharp or not, basically.</p>
<p id="p-173">Yeah, interesting.</p>
<p id="p-174">But there's a one about an elevator too, that kind of breaks the mold.</p>
<p id="p-175">Yes, this is a different one.</p>
<p id="p-176">And there are a lot of ones like this as well.</p>
<p id="p-177">I could do a whole other episode, but it's so mean spirit.</p>
<p id="p-178">I feel bad even saying it.</p>
<p id="p-179">Oh, what is it?</p>
<p id="p-180">Well, should I say it or?</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-181">Well, should I say it, or?</p>
<p id="p-182">Sure, go for it.</p>
<p id="p-183">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-184">My elevator doesn't go all the way to the top.</p>
<p id="p-185">I hope people aren't going to isolate this, Lindsay, and then play it one day with AI, and you're just saying my elevator doesn't. No, well, who knows?</p>
<p id="p-186">It probably will happen.</p>
<p id="p-187">But you know what?</p>
<p id="p-188">I have a fun one that my dad used to use all the time.</p>
<p id="p-189">He used to say, you're not playing with a full deck.</p>
<p id="p-190">Do you know that one?</p>
<p id="p-191">Ah, yes, yes.</p>
<p id="p-192">That's a fun one.</p>
<p id="p-193">That's a fun one.</p>
<p id="p-194">And, you know, sometimes we learn language from our family members, you know, what they used to say.</p>
<p id="p-195">So, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-196">And what do these mean?</p>
<p id="p-197">I mean, you're not playing with a full deck.</p>
<p id="p-198">What does that mean?</p>
<p id="p-199">Something's missing, right?</p>
<p id="p-200">Something's missing.</p>
<p id="p-201">And so, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-202">But Michelle, overall, we think these are definitely offensive if they're used in the wrong way.</p>
<p id="p-203">So be super careful.</p>
<p id="p-204">Yes, They could be insulting someone's intelligence.</p>
<p id="p-205">But, of course, context is king.</p>
<p id="p-206">And it's just good to consider why you might hear that.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-207">to consider why you might hear this or who it is okay to hear it from or say it to.</p>
<p id="p-208">So we're going to do some more examples after we break.</p>
<p id="p-209">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-210">Do you like to travel?</p>
<p id="p-211">So do we.</p>
<p id="p-212">Exciting announcement here for all travelers.</p>
<p id="p-213">You can find the All Ears English podcast in the in-flight entertainment on Lufthansa Airlines.</p>
<p id="p-214">Prepare yourself for business or travel English while you're on board.</p>
<p id="p-215">Check out All Ears English on your next Lufthansa flight.</p>
<p id="p-216">Okay, Michelle, back for more examples.</p>
<p id="p-217">So would you like to give us the first one here?</p>
<p id="p-218">Sure.</p>
<p id="p-219">Ah, I keep forgetting what our password is.</p>
<p id="p-220">Seriously.</p>
<p id="p-221">I feel like I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-222">Yeah, And here you're also qualifying it.</p>
<p id="p-223">You're saying sometimes, right?</p>
<p id="p-224">It's giving more context.</p>
<p id="p-225">It's situational.</p>
<p id="p-226">Or I've known you since third grade.</p>
<p id="p-227">You're not the brightest crayon in the box when it comes to football rules.</p>
<p id="p-228">Yeah, </p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-229">it comes to football rules.</p>
<p id="p-230">That's probably me when it comes to football rules.</p>
<p id="p-231">I don't know any rules of football.</p>
<p id="p-232">Oh, I'm horrible.</p>
<p id="p-233">Yeah, But, Lindsay, what's the point of our students learning this if it's a bit mean-spirited?</p>
<p id="p-234">I think it can be certainly useful when it comes to self-deprecating humor, right?</p>
<p id="p-235">So you have permission to say this about yourself if you feel like you want to.</p>
<p id="p-236">I wouldn't recommend saying it broadly about yourself.</p>
<p id="p-237">Overall, I'd give it the scenarios that we talked about, about football rules or technology or certain interesting aspects of life that you can say you're not very good at, right?</p>
<p id="p-238">Yeah, Yeah, Right, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-239">So just be careful.</p>
<p id="p-240">That's all.</p>
<p id="p-241">So the rules are you can use it for self-deprecating humor, but not in a situation you don't want to put yourself down too much or somebody you're very close with and you're teasing them.</p>
<p id="p-242">If you stick with those, you're pretty safe.</p>
<p id="p-243">Yeah, No.</p>
<p id="p-244">So I shared the example of</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-245">Yeah, no.</p>
<p id="p-246">So I shared the example of what my dad used to say to me, you know, that's a very close family member, right?</p>
<p id="p-247">Teasing you.</p>
<p id="p-248">That's that example.</p>
<p id="p-249">So we want to really make sure we stay within these rules and then we'll probably be okay.</p>
<p id="p-250">All right.</p>
<p id="p-251">All right.</p>
<p id="p-252">Let's do a role play.</p>
<p id="p-253">All right.</p>
<p id="p-254">So here we are best friends and we're trying to fix your phone.</p>
<p id="p-255">Oh geez.</p>
<p id="p-256">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-257">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-258">How did you break the screen again?</p>
<p id="p-259">I know I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed.</p>
<p id="p-260">Am I? Certainly not when it comes to phones.</p>
<p id="p-261">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-262">So can we take this piece out?</p>
<p id="p-263">We can try.</p>
<p id="p-264">Oh man.</p>
<p id="p-265">You know, I'm not the brightest crayon on the box with technology.</p>
<p id="p-266">Yeah, Your elevator doesn't go all the way to the top.</p>
<p id="p-267">I'm trying to help you.</p>
<p id="p-268">Oh geez.</p>
<p id="p-269">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-270">So yeah, I mean close friends, they banter, right?</p>
<p id="p-271">Especially when they know it's not going to be hurtful because they know the person.</p>
<p id="p-272">It's a special level of connection that you have, right?</p>
<p id="p-273">When you reach that place.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-274">When you reach that place with somebody where you're kind of just going back and forth teasing each other, you're really in a good spot.</p>
<p id="p-275">You've really become kind of close to that person.</p>
<p id="p-276">Yeah, you got it.</p>
<p id="p-277">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-278">So, okay.</p>
<p id="p-279">Michelle, what did you say first?</p>
<p id="p-280">All right.</p>
<p id="p-281">So I said, I know I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed, am I? And then I said, oh man, you know, I'm not the brightest crayon in the box with technology.</p>
<p id="p-282">And then I gave a little specific scenario that I'm not good at, right?</p>
<p id="p-283">And then I said, yeah, your elevator doesn't go all the way to the top.</p>
<p id="p-284">Now you're really teasing me and I'm pushing back, I'm saying, hey, you know, I'm trying to help you.</p>
<p id="p-285">Why are you teasing me?</p>
<p id="p-286">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-287">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-288">So we're having a good time.</p>
<p id="p-289">Yeah, All right, Michelle, what's another episode our listeners could go to right away to keep listening?</p>
<p id="p-290">All right.</p>
<p id="p-291">So head on over to episode 2315.</p>
<p id="p-292">That was who asked you rude phrases to avoid in English?</p>
<p id="p-293">Yes, Love it.</p>
