<p>I'm good.</p>
<p>Do you ever color like with crayons?</p>
<p>Oh, not not since I was younger But I do know that adult coloring books had kind of a trend going a few years ago So yeah, I knew people that were getting them for holidays or birthdays and using them.</p>
<p>I guess it's you know Meditative or relaxing, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, that's that's the idea.</p>
<p>I I got I I got on that trend When it first happened, but I think I colored two pages, I don't know Well, did it help for you?</p>
<p>Was it?</p>
<p>Relaxing a way of focusing the mind and resting at the point Yeah, I get the point, you know, cuz you're only focusing on those movements And so it's nice the other over Thanksgiving my sister-in-law loves to paint Oh wait to relax and so I never paint with her But then the other day she brought it out and we were just painting together and I thought it's kind of nice.</p>
<p>That's amazing What a cool thing to be able to go to</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>What a cool thing to be able to go to.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Well, she's a good artist.</p>
<p>So amazing.</p>
<p>Well, I'm excited.</p>
<p>We're getting on into this topic of crayons and it's going to come out.</p>
<p>Yes, it's got sort of in one way or another, but we are going to have a listener question today.</p>
<p>This episode is based on a great listener question.</p>
<p>So shall I read the question, Michelle?</p>
<p>Yes, please.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So our listener Sylvia has asked, Hello, Lindsay, Michelle, Jessica and Aubrey.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your podcast and your efforts to teach us in such an entertaining way.</p>
<p>I've been listening to your podcast and watching your videos on YouTube for about three weeks now.</p>
<p>I try to listen to at least five episodes a day, so I still have a lot to catch up on.</p>
<p>Well, welcome to our community, Sylvia.</p>
<p>So great, Michelle, to have you.</p>
<p>I'm glad you're already sending in a question.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>That is such a good sign for this listener.</p>
<p>Guys, make sure you send us your questions.</p>
<p>Send them in to support at allearsenglish.com.</p>
<p>We'll get them on our list.</p>
<p>And if it's a good question, we'll answer it and read your name out loud on the show.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>out loud on the show.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I have a question about an idiom.</p>
<p>I'm not the brightest candle on the chandelier.</p>
<p>I know there are variations, different variations of this expression.</p>
<p>We use similar ones in German and Hungarian.</p>
<p>English is my third language.</p>
<p>In Hungarian, for example, we say not the sharpest knife in the drawer.</p>
<p>What variations exist in English and how commonly are they used?</p>
<p>Also, is this expression considered offensive or can it be taken with a wink and a smile?</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your hard work and I wish you all the best moving forward.</p>
<p>Best regards, Sylvia.</p>
<p>Lovely.</p>
<p>Lovely, Michelle.</p>
<p>Such a great and fun question.</p>
<p>I was very excited to plan this one.</p>
<p>So thank you so much.</p>
<p>So this is interesting.</p>
<p>So I think the main part of the question is at the end because we need to talk about this for sure.</p>
<p>Sylvia asks, is this expression considered offensive or can it be taken with a wink and a smile?</p>
<p>Yeah, So we're definitely going to talk about what.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>We're definitely going to talk about what the feeling is behind these types of expressions.</p>
<p>But before we do that, we want to remind you guys to hit the follow button so you never miss anything from us.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>We have a lot of old episodes, past episodes, but we come out with five new episodes a week.</p>
<p>And so, stay up to date with our newest episodes, everyone.</p>
<p>Go ahead and hit that follow button so you can make All Ears English a part of your day.</p>
<p>That's the key.</p>
<p>That's how we get better.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yes, Exactly.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Is this offensive?</p>
<p>I mean, I think, Michelle, essentially, yes.</p>
<p>It's extremely offensive because you're saying that you're not smart, right?</p>
<p>First of all, it depends on who we're saying it about.</p>
<p>Are we saying it about ourselves?</p>
<p>In that case, it can be okay.</p>
<p>It can be acceptable.</p>
<p>It's a self-deprecating way of connecting, really, connecting with others.</p>
<p>Now, if you go and say it about someone else, there are shades of gray there, too.</p>
<p>There are nuances, right, Michelle?</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>There are nuances, right Michelle?</p>
<p>Right, We want to be careful.</p>
<p>It could be offensive.</p>
<p>Yeah, it could very well be offensive You would have to be using it with somebody, you know, pretty well very well.</p>
<p>Yeah, and in a in a very kind of Funny way right not not seriously insulting them.</p>
<p>So that's oh, yeah Yeah, so that that's that's basically what I would say, but so let's get let's get into it more So Sylvia says I'm not the brightest candle on the chandelier as the example.</p>
<p>Have you heard that one that one?</p>
<p>I don't think I've heard it in that exact way with those exact words I mean, we're saying the same thing across different cultures here, right?</p>
<p>They're just variations of the same idiom, but I don't think we use that one.</p>
<p>Michelle.</p>
<p>Do you think I Don't hear this one as often when I was researching for the episode.</p>
<p>I found it But to me, it's not one of the more common ones that we use So we're gonna talk about some of the common ones today.</p>
<p>So the idea let's talk about</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>idea, let's talk about kind of the structure of this.</p>
<p>It's, I'm not the, or someone is not the, something-ist, so an adjective-ist, noun in the noun.</p>
<p>Noun in the noun.</p>
<p>I'm not the something noun in the noun.</p>
<p>Yes, There's the breakdown.</p>
<p>Right, Okay.</p>
<p>But we'll give a lot of examples.</p>
<p>So you're saying something that comes in something else.</p>
<p>So, or, or something that is on something else, like I guess the chandelier.</p>
<p>So, I mean, the biggest one that I think about is this, what we talked about with the crayon.</p>
<p>Lindsay, is that a common, can you say what that one is?</p>
<p>Yeah, So this is, I'm not the brightest crayon in the box.</p>
<p>Yeah, So essentially, I mean, technically you could even make up your own, which would be really clever, right?</p>
<p>You could make up, you could, I mean, if you want to be really creative with language, you could, you could make up your own idiom in this context, as long as you understand the formula, right?</p>
<p>Right,</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>formula.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Right, Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>So I'm not the brightest crayon in the box.</p>
<p>Noun in the noun.</p>
<p>Right, And that was interesting because that's kind of a double play on words because we also use the word bright to refer to intelligence.</p>
<p>Right, So you're saying I'm not the the brightest color crayon in the box, but I'm also not the smartest.</p>
<p>So that's that one is extra special.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's true.</p>
<p>That's a good point.</p>
<p>Yeah, So yeah, if you and you know, if you use this on its own, it means you're not that smart.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yes, So what can be okay is if you use it by itself, or if you use it just with something else.</p>
<p>So let me explain what I mean.</p>
<p>I'm not the brightest crayon in the box when it comes to technology.</p>
<p>So you can be specific, right?</p>
<p>So if you add when it comes to that can be a good way to be specific.</p>
<p>You're not just saying, I'm not bright.</p>
<p>You're just</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>I'm not bright.</p>
<p>Yeah, you're just saying right this isn't something that I know a lot about Yeah, we would recommend that exactly and it builds nuance to what you're saying.</p>
<p>It builds context It makes people want to ask you a question.</p>
<p>Well, maybe you're really into art if you're not into technology, right?</p>
<p>They just gives people more to work with more to respond to.</p>
<p>Okay, exactly So let's do some of the other ones.</p>
<p>These are some of the other ones I've heard Lindsay and if you use them or not, we can talk through them.</p>
<p>So what's the first one?</p>
<p>All right, not the sharpest tool in the shed.</p>
<p>I think this one is the one I've heard the most Yeah, I think this might also be on a song from the 90s if I'm not right.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so But anyways, what's the next one Michelle?</p>
<p>Okay, not the sharpest tool in the shed.</p>
<p>And now there's I found this one not the sharpest pencil in the cup Interesting.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Also sharp sharp is You're right because right We could do another episode a follow-up episode here Michelle on ways to say intelligent bright sharp</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>to say intelligent, bright, sharp.</p>
<p>There's a lot.</p>
<p>I mean, we are a culture that hyper values intelligence, right?</p>
<p>Hyper values conceptual cerebral intelligence, book smarts.</p>
<p>And so we have a lot of words for that, for sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, that would be a fun one, different ways to say smart.</p>
<p>Yeah, interesting.</p>
<p>Okay, and then there's also not the brightest bulb in the box, so that goes back to bright.</p>
<p>Interesting, so I wonder if we advise our listeners to make up their own.</p>
<p>I wonder if we have to use that double play on words when it comes to this idiom.</p>
<p>Something has to be about like, so if it's lights and things being sharp or not, basically.</p>
<p>Yeah, interesting.</p>
<p>But there's a one about an elevator too, that kind of breaks the mold.</p>
<p>Yes, this is a different one.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of ones like this as well.</p>
<p>I could do a whole other episode, but it's so mean spirit.</p>
<p>I feel bad even saying it.</p>
<p>Oh, what is it?</p>
<p>Well, should I say it or?</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>Well, should I say it, or?</p>
<p>Sure, go for it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>My elevator doesn't go all the way to the top.</p>
<p>I hope people aren't going to isolate this, Lindsay, and then play it one day with AI, and you're just saying my elevator doesn't. No, well, who knows?</p>
<p>It probably will happen.</p>
<p>But you know what?</p>
<p>I have a fun one that my dad used to use all the time.</p>
<p>He used to say, you're not playing with a full deck.</p>
<p>Do you know that one?</p>
<p>Ah, yes, yes.</p>
<p>That's a fun one.</p>
<p>That's a fun one.</p>
<p>And, you know, sometimes we learn language from our family members, you know, what they used to say.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>And what do these mean?</p>
<p>I mean, you're not playing with a full deck.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Something's missing, right?</p>
<p>Something's missing.</p>
<p>And so, yeah.</p>
<p>But Michelle, overall, we think these are definitely offensive if they're used in the wrong way.</p>
<p>So be super careful.</p>
<p>Yes, They could be insulting someone's intelligence.</p>
<p>But, of course, context is king.</p>
<p>And it's just good to consider why you might hear that.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>to consider why you might hear this or who it is okay to hear it from or say it to.</p>
<p>So we're going to do some more examples after we break.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Do you like to travel?</p>
<p>So do we.</p>
<p>Exciting announcement here for all travelers.</p>
<p>You can find the All Ears English podcast in the in-flight entertainment on Lufthansa Airlines.</p>
<p>Prepare yourself for business or travel English while you're on board.</p>
<p>Check out All Ears English on your next Lufthansa flight.</p>
<p>Okay, Michelle, back for more examples.</p>
<p>So would you like to give us the first one here?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Ah, I keep forgetting what our password is.</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>I feel like I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed sometimes.</p>
<p>Yeah, And here you're also qualifying it.</p>
<p>You're saying sometimes, right?</p>
<p>It's giving more context.</p>
<p>It's situational.</p>
<p>Or I've known you since third grade.</p>
<p>You're not the brightest crayon in the box when it comes to football rules.</p>
<p>Yeah, </p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>it comes to football rules.</p>
<p>That's probably me when it comes to football rules.</p>
<p>I don't know any rules of football.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm horrible.</p>
<p>Yeah, But, Lindsay, what's the point of our students learning this if it's a bit mean-spirited?</p>
<p>I think it can be certainly useful when it comes to self-deprecating humor, right?</p>
<p>So you have permission to say this about yourself if you feel like you want to.</p>
<p>I wouldn't recommend saying it broadly about yourself.</p>
<p>Overall, I'd give it the scenarios that we talked about, about football rules or technology or certain interesting aspects of life that you can say you're not very good at, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, Right, Exactly.</p>
<p>So just be careful.</p>
<p>That's all.</p>
<p>So the rules are you can use it for self-deprecating humor, but not in a situation you don't want to put yourself down too much or somebody you're very close with and you're teasing them.</p>
<p>If you stick with those, you're pretty safe.</p>
<p>Yeah, No.</p>
<p>So I shared the example of</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>Yeah, no.</p>
<p>So I shared the example of what my dad used to say to me, you know, that's a very close family member, right?</p>
<p>Teasing you.</p>
<p>That's that example.</p>
<p>So we want to really make sure we stay within these rules and then we'll probably be okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Let's do a role play.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So here we are best friends and we're trying to fix your phone.</p>
<p>Oh geez.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>How did you break the screen again?</p>
<p>I know I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed.</p>
<p>Am I? Certainly not when it comes to phones.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So can we take this piece out?</p>
<p>We can try.</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>You know, I'm not the brightest crayon on the box with technology.</p>
<p>Yeah, Your elevator doesn't go all the way to the top.</p>
<p>I'm trying to help you.</p>
<p>Oh geez.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean close friends, they banter, right?</p>
<p>Especially when they know it's not going to be hurtful because they know the person.</p>
<p>It's a special level of connection that you have, right?</p>
<p>When you reach that place.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>When you reach that place with somebody where you're kind of just going back and forth teasing each other, you're really in a good spot.</p>
<p>You've really become kind of close to that person.</p>
<p>Yeah, you got it.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So, okay.</p>
<p>Michelle, what did you say first?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So I said, I know I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed, am I? And then I said, oh man, you know, I'm not the brightest crayon in the box with technology.</p>
<p>And then I gave a little specific scenario that I'm not good at, right?</p>
<p>And then I said, yeah, your elevator doesn't go all the way to the top.</p>
<p>Now you're really teasing me and I'm pushing back, I'm saying, hey, you know, I'm trying to help you.</p>
<p>Why are you teasing me?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So we're having a good time.</p>
<p>Yeah, All right, Michelle, what's another episode our listeners could go to right away to keep listening?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So head on over to episode 2315.</p>
<p>That was who asked you rude phrases to avoid in English?</p>
<p>Yes, Love it.</p>
<p>Any takeaway today where we should leave our listeners?</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>where we should leave our listeners?</p>
<p>Well, you know, I wonder how much this exists in other languages.</p>
<p>I'm very curious if this is a very common way to describe people not being that smart about something.</p>
<p>So that to me is, I'm curious, so write to us, let us know if it's common in your language to say something like this.</p>
<p>And then also the takeaway is, try using this with a close friend.</p>
<p>I think that would be fun.</p>
<p>You gotta use it in a certain fun way and about something very lighthearted.</p>
<p>Exactly, if you have that vibe with a friend where this makes sense, you already tease each other a lot, drop this in, give it a try, see how it goes.</p>
<p>Follow the rules that we've laid out, close friends, family members, or self-deprecating, try it that way.</p>
<p>Don't be mean to people.</p>
<p>I mean, don't use this in a mean, a weaponized way.</p>
<p>Right, Michelle?</p>
<p>Yeah, don't like use it with your boss or.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p>Don't, like, use it with your boss or something like that.</p>
<p>Like, I mean... No.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Great stuff.</p>
<p>Michelle, you have a good day.</p>
<p>I'll talk to you soon.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
