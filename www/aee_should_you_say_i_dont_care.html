<p id="p-23">So feeling great, feeling great.</p>
<p id="p-24">Yes, guys, we hope you are enjoying listening on your Saturday.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-25">I hope you are enjoying listening on your Saturday.</p>
<p id="p-26">Maybe you're about to go to brunch.</p>
<p id="p-27">Maybe you're still in bed.</p>
<p id="p-28">Maybe you're sitting in your slippers and your PJs on the couch and drinking a coffee.</p>
<p id="p-29">That's how I like to imagine it.</p>
<p id="p-30">That's what I would be doing.</p>
<p id="p-31">That's what I like to do on Saturday mornings.</p>
<p id="p-32">I like to get up, eat breakfast, get a coffee, and then read a magazine or something or read a book on the couch.</p>
<p id="p-33">So nice.</p>
<p id="p-34">Yes, So Lindsay, I have a question though.</p>
<p id="p-35">Do you think I don't care is a rude thing to say?</p>
<p id="p-36">Oh, I think eight out of 10 times the answer is yes.</p>
<p id="p-37">Yeah, Yeah, Yes, that's my opinion.</p>
<p id="p-38">But we're going to see today with the context.</p>
<p id="p-39">We're going to build this a little bit and answer a great listener question.</p>
<p id="p-40">Right, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-41">Yes, this is a good one.</p>
<p id="p-42">I'm excited for this episode.</p>
<p id="p-43">So guys, remember to hit follow wherever you are listening to All Ears English so you never miss anything from us.</p>

<p id="p-46">Have them come to you.</p>
<p id="p-47">Yeah, we do this for you guys.</p>
<p id="p-48">You know, our philosophy</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-49">We do this for you guys, you know, our philosophy here is connection, not perfection.</p>
<p id="p-50">And that means we're going to show you how to create human connection in any situation, even if you're making mistakes, it's okay.</p>
<p id="p-51">All right.</p>
<p id="p-52">So if you believe in human connection when it comes to speaking English, go ahead and hit that follow button.</p>
<p id="p-53">All right?</p>
<p id="p-54">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-55">All right, Lindsay, would you like to read the question?</p>
<p id="p-56">This is from YouTube.</p>
<p id="p-57">I would love to.</p>
<p id="p-58">Here we go.</p>
<p id="p-59">This is from Leon C. They say, Hi guys, thank you for all your amazing episodes.</p>
<p id="p-60">I have a question about I don't care because of my personality, I avoid saying it and I use other words.</p>
<p id="p-61">But I do hear Native American English speakers using it sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-62">Can you please explain when and how to use it?</p>
<p id="p-63">Fantastic question.</p>
<p id="p-64">Yes, This is a good question.</p>
<p id="p-65">I had to think about this one.</p>
<p id="p-66">So, I mean, Lindsay, you kind of already expressed your immediate reaction is so eight times out of 10 rude.</p>
<p id="p-67">That's what you think?</p>
<p id="p-68">I kind of think so.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-69">I kind of think so, but I'm interested to see the examples we build out today.</p>
<p id="p-70">I'm going to reserve my opinion.</p>
<p id="p-71">But when I just as a gut reaction, yeah, I don't. I try to avoid this.</p>
<p id="p-72">It feels a little abrupt, I think.</p>
<p id="p-73">OK, yes.</p>
<p id="p-74">So it definitely depends on the context.</p>
<p id="p-75">So we're going to go through it, Lindsay, and hopefully that'll help you decide more of your opinion.</p>
<p id="p-76">But I think we're pretty much in agreement.</p>
<p id="p-77">So let's talk about first why we think Leon is asking this question.</p>
<p id="p-78">So if you use this when you're talking about something you should care about, it can be extremely rude.</p>
<p id="p-79">And that's what I think the key is here.</p>
<p id="p-80">So if it's something you should care about and you say I don't care, that is very, very rude.</p>
<p id="p-81">If it doesn't matter, it's probably OK, So it's probably OK, I think it's probably OK, but I would still say it's annoying for people to hear.</p>
<p id="p-82">Like when it comes to choosing.</p>
<p id="p-83">Yeah,</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-84">When it comes to choosing, yeah, the first example we have, choosing where to have dinner, it's better to have an opinion.</p>
<p id="p-85">Maybe that's a different topic for another day, but when you say, oh, where do you want to have dinner?</p>
<p id="p-86">Oh, I don't care.</p>
<p id="p-87">I've tried to get away from this lately, you know, by either having an opinion or just, I don't know, the I don't care kind of feels a little too blasé, a little too like I actually don't care.</p>
<p id="p-88">But you do care because you want to go out for dinner with your friend.</p>
<p id="p-89">You want to have a nice experience.</p>
<p id="p-90">Right, Yeah, Right, No, I agree.</p>
<p id="p-91">Yeah, So if you say, oh, like they give you two options, you say, I don't care.</p>
<p id="p-92">They both sound great.</p>
<p id="p-93">It's probably okay.</p>
<p id="p-94">So I've separated these into probably okay and not okay.</p>
<p id="p-95">Yeah, So notice I don't have a category for a great, awesome time to use it.</p>
<p id="p-96">And at the end of the episode, we'll give you some better alternatives.</p>
<p id="p-97">For some reason, I just feel like the phrase, I don't care, it has, I don't know, it just, it is okay in this scenario.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-98">It is okay in this scenario, right?</p>
<p id="p-99">What we're going to share, but just feels a little indifferent, expressing indifference in a more negative way, if that makes sense.</p>
<p id="p-100">So what about in this example?</p>
<p id="p-101">Okay, so let's say somebody made a mistake and they think you're going to be angry about it.</p>
<p id="p-102">So this is an interesting one where it might be okay.</p>
<p id="p-103">So for example, your friend was getting your groceries and they picked up the wrong brand of pretzels.</p>
<p id="p-104">They were doing you a favor and then, you know, it's the wrong brand.</p>
<p id="p-105">So they should say, oh, I'm so sorry.</p>
<p id="p-106">And then you might say, oh yeah, oh, I don't care.</p>
<p id="p-107">The brand totally doesn't matter to me.</p>
<p id="p-108">Oh yeah, that's great.</p>
<p id="p-109">So yeah, so there is a use for it when you're kind of appeasing someone in a sense.</p>
<p id="p-110">Right, you're saying, it's kind of like saying, oh, it's okay.</p>
<p id="p-111">It doesn't matter, right?</p>
<p id="p-112">Right, because you're literally saying it doesn't matter.</p>
<p id="p-113">So that's the right time to express that you don't care, right?</p>
<p id="p-114">Not as much when it's like choosing a restaurant where, well, you don't care then why are we even going out?</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-115">I don't care then.</p>
<p id="p-116">Why are we even going out?</p>
<p id="p-117">Right, Why don't we all just sit here?</p>
<p id="p-118">Yeah, Or what about this?</p>
<p id="p-119">When you're removed from something.</p>
<p id="p-120">So it's not so much in your life, but maybe you're commenting on something.</p>
<p id="p-121">So commenting on something in the news, something that doesn't make a difference for you.</p>
<p id="p-122">So for example, I just can't stand watching cable news anymore.</p>
<p id="p-123">I don't care about their opinions.</p>
<p id="p-124">I just want the real news.</p>
<p id="p-125">Yes, No, that's perfect.</p>
<p id="p-126">That is totally okay.</p>
<p id="p-127">That's how I've been feeling lately about CNN.</p>
<p id="p-128">I actually haven't turned on CNN since the election, believe it or not.</p>
<p id="p-129">Oh, wow.</p>
<p id="p-130">With all the talk heads, how it was so intense leading up to the election.</p>
<p id="p-131">And they would have random people on like podcasters, not even an investigative journalist, just people that are, hey, let me tell you my opinion.</p>
<p id="p-132">That would be the perfect scenario to say this.</p>
<p id="p-133">I don't care about what these people think.</p>
<p id="p-134">I want the real news.</p>
<p id="p-135">Tell me what's going on in my local community, right?</p>
<p id="p-136">Right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-137">And I think, like I said, I think that this is okay.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-138">like I said, I think that this is okay to use because you're removed.</p>
<p id="p-139">This is not, you're not going to offend those people.</p>
<p id="p-140">It's like another degree of separation.</p>
<p id="p-141">It's okay.</p>
<p id="p-142">Yeah, you're not, it's not like you're in front of them.</p>
<p id="p-143">If you're in front of them, you obviously, if you're on that show, you don't want to say I don't care what you think because you're then engaged and you're right next to them and you're having an exchange.</p>
<p id="p-144">It's kind of about how removed are you from this thing or is it actually better to maintain the relationship?</p>
<p id="p-145">Like in the example of the pretzels, you want to make that person feel okay, right?</p>
<p id="p-146">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-147">All right, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-148">So those are some great examples of when it would be okay.</p>
<p id="p-149">So kind of the answer for our listener today is pretty nuanced, isn't it?</p>
<p id="p-150">Yeah, it is.</p>
<p id="p-151">There are times where it is okay, but then when you are maybe making a decision, it's really this, well, let's go over what's not okay.</p>
<p id="p-152">So anything you should.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-153">Okay, so anything you should care about.</p>
<p id="p-154">So I really think that this is how we can kind of put these things in buckets, really.</p>
<p id="p-155">Should you care about it, right, or not, right?</p>
<p id="p-156">And also, you know, how far are you from this situation?</p>
<p id="p-157">So example, a fight with a partner or a friend.</p>
<p id="p-158">If you say, I don't care in a fight, ooh, not good, not good.</p>
<p id="p-159">No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p id="p-160">That's very personal, right?</p>
<p id="p-161">The person's gonna take it personally as they should.</p>
<p id="p-162">Yes, You're indicating maybe you don't care about the relationship ultimately, even if that's not what you're talking about, you are kind of saying that in a way.</p>
<p id="p-163">Right, or what about with a work relationship, Lindsay?</p>
<p id="p-164">Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-165">So if your coworker asks you if you could help her with something, maybe there's a strange for time, you could say something, if you say, yeah, I don't care, I can't help you with that.</p>
<p id="p-166">No.</p>
<p id="p-167">No, no, we're not gonna.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-168">No, we're not going to do that.</p>
<p id="p-169">That would be a really bad, a really quick way to make enemies at work, right?</p>
<p id="p-170">Yes, So, I mean, in many other situations, if you are close to that situation and you say, I don't care, that is going to reflect negatively on you.</p>
<p id="p-171">I mean, we could do many other situations, we could do more episodes on this, but I think that's what it comes down to.</p>
<p id="p-172">It's a no-no if you're close to the situation.</p>
<p id="p-173">Yeah, so I think, I mean, as we're saying, it's not that you never use it, but it's you're very selective, right?</p>
<p id="p-174">We're very smart about how we're using it.</p>
<p id="p-175">Now, there are situations like when you're scolding your teenager or your child, right?</p>
<p id="p-176">For example, I don't care that your friends all stayed out past curfew.</p>
<p id="p-177">You know the rules.</p>
<p id="p-178">This is coming for you, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-179">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-180">Oh, God.</p>
<p id="p-181">Lindsay, did you have a curfew growing up?</p>
<p id="p-182">I think we maybe talked about this once.</p>
<p id="p-183">I think I did.</p>
<p id="p-184">I think I did.</p>
<p id="p-185">I feel like I remember 11 p.m. at one point was my curfew, but I really didn't.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-186">was my curfew, but I really didn't, I don't know, I wasn't crazy and wild in high school.</p>
<p id="p-187">So, you know, I wouldn't really stay up past curfew.</p>
<p id="p-188">I never really had an issue.</p>
<p id="p-189">So what are some other things you could say?</p>
<p id="p-190">If you don't want to say, I don't care because of all the reasons we just said, what else could you say?</p>
<p id="p-191">These are much better choices for our listeners today.</p>
<p id="p-192">Doesn't matter to me.</p>
<p id="p-193">We can go at seven or eight.</p>
<p id="p-194">Doesn't matter to me.</p>
<p id="p-195">So it's okay to express that you're open and that you don't have an exact plan of exactly where you're going to go all the time for dinner.</p>
<p id="p-196">But say something different rather than I don't care.</p>
<p id="p-197">Or you could say, it's all good.</p>
<p id="p-198">So it's all good.</p>
<p id="p-199">I know you're running late.</p>
<p id="p-200">Take your time.</p>
<p id="p-201">So in that one where you're trying to appease someone or make someone feel better about something instead of saying, oh, I don't care, right?</p>
<p id="p-202">If you just want another option, you could say, oh, it's all good.</p>
<p id="p-203">I like that one.</p>
<p id="p-204">I use that sometimes for sure.</p>
<p id="p-205">What's another one?</p>
<p id="p-206">Is there something else?</p>
<p id="p-207">Yes, it's fine either way.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-208">It's fine either way, or you could say, I'm good either way.</p>
<p id="p-209">So both places sound nice.</p>
<p id="p-210">I'm good either way.</p>
<p id="p-211">Yes, yes.</p>
<p id="p-212">And I love that.</p>
<p id="p-213">So just better, again, okay to be indifferent.</p>
<p id="p-214">I still recommend having an idea of where you want to go, let's say for the dinner choice, or just having opinions about things in general.</p>
<p id="p-215">It just makes you kind of a more interesting person.</p>
<p id="p-216">But these are better alternatives instead of I don't care, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-217">Yes, exactly, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-218">So in general, if you should care, don't say I don't care.</p>
<p id="p-219">If you're saying I don't care about options presented to you, also consider that same rule, try to make the decisions.</p>
<p id="p-220">And just don't show apathy unless it's expected.</p>
<p id="p-221">Yes, I love that.</p>
<p id="p-222">Practice having opinions, experience different, I always use the example of the restaurant, but have an opinion on different kinds of food.</p>
<p id="p-223">What food do you like?</p>
<p id="p-224">Do you like Thai food?</p>
<p id="p-225">Do you like Indian food?</p>
<p id="p-226">Where do you want to go?</p>
<p id="p-227">What kind of food do you enjoy?</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-228">Do you enjoy, then you just become more interesting and can bring your friends to experience new things too, right?</p>
<p id="p-229">Yep, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-230">So we also want to, before we get into our role play, we want to say thank you so much to our reviewers.</p>
<p id="p-231">Yes, a special thank you to Marie from Japan.</p>
<p id="p-232">And by the way, in Marie's review, she asked a great question.</p>
<p id="p-233">And that question is going to make it right over to our list of amazing questions.</p>
<p id="p-234">And if it's a great one, we're going to answer it on the show.</p>
<p id="p-235">So that is one great way to get your question over to us.</p>
<p id="p-236">Go ahead and write it in your review.</p>
<p id="p-237">Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-238">Thank you.</p>
<p id="p-239">And a special thank you to Molly Zhu as well.</p>
<p id="p-240">All right.</p>
<p id="p-241">Thank you guys.</p>
<p id="p-242">Leave your review for All Ears English to let us know what you think about the show.</p>
<p id="p-243">And we'll try to announce your name out loud.</p>
<p id="p-244">All right.</p>
<p id="p-245">Thanks, guys.</p>
<p id="p-246">Let's do a role play.</p>
<p id="p-247">So here we are friends and we are deciding on how to get to the airport.</p>
<p id="p-248">Okay, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-249">Hmm, so should we...</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-250">Hmm, so should we Uber or drive?</p>
<p id="p-251">What?</p>
<p id="p-252">Uber or drive?</p>
<p id="p-253">Oh, I don't care.</p>
<p id="p-254">Michelle, I feel like I'm the one doing all the planning here.</p>
<p id="p-255">Can you help me out a little?</p>
<p id="p-256">Oh, I'm sorry.</p>
<p id="p-257">I mean, really though, I'm good either way.</p>
<p id="p-258">Maybe Uber?</p>
<p id="p-259">Okay, thank you.</p>
<p id="p-260">I'm sorry about that.</p>
<p id="p-261">It's all good.</p>
<p id="p-262">Uh-oh, things are not getting off to a good start before we leave on our trip here.</p>
<p id="p-263">Yes, I know.</p>
<p id="p-264">On a trip you have to make a lot of decisions, so I hope I'm not like this the whole time.</p>
<p id="p-265">I think we've said before that we would not travel well together because both our partners are the planners for the trips.</p>
<p id="p-266">Is that right?</p>
<p id="p-267">Well, you and I, we would be like sitting in a coffee shop like the whole day.</p>
<p id="p-268">Probably in the airport and never even get on the plane.</p>
<p id="p-269">Oh gosh.</p>
<p id="p-270">All right, let's break this down here, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-271">So I said Uber or drive.</p>
<p id="p-272">So I'm breaking down my question to make it simple, right, to get your attention.</p>
<p id="p-273">And you say... Oh, I don't care.</p>
<p id="p-274">Yeah,</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-275">Yeah, and then I said, hey, Michelle, I'm doing all the planning.</p>
<p id="p-276">Can you help me out here?</p>
<p id="p-277">And you said, oh, I'm sorry.</p>
<p id="p-278">Really, though, I'm good either way.</p>
<p id="p-279">And then I do try and I say, maybe Uber?</p>
<p id="p-280">And then you said thank you and you said I'm sorry about that.</p>
<p id="p-281">And I said it's all good.</p>
<p id="p-282">So we're, you know, making amends at the start of our trip here.</p>
<p id="p-283">So we'll see how the rest of the trip goes, right?</p>
<p id="p-284">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-285">That's right.</p>
<p id="p-286">That's right.</p>
<p id="p-287">All right.</p>
<p id="p-288">So, Lindsay, what's another episode our listeners can go check out?</p>
<p id="p-289">Yeah, 2353 just a few days ago is a great one to check out.</p>
<p id="p-290">How to call people out on their quirks.</p>
<p id="p-291">And a quirk is, what is a quirk, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-292">We talked about it, but just a quick revision here.</p>
<p id="p-293">Something they do frequently that's a little bit unique or funny.</p>
<p id="p-294">You got it.</p>
<p id="p-295">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-296">So go check that one out, 2353.</p>
<p id="p-297">And what's our takeaway for today?</p>
<p id="p-298">Takeaway is not</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-299">Takeaway is not I don't care.</p>
<p id="p-300">It can be useful, but it's not really the greatest choice in general.</p>
<p id="p-301">However, if you're going to use it, make sure you're removed from the situation.</p>
<p id="p-302">Oh, I don't care about celebrity gossip.</p>
<p id="p-303">I don't care about this show.</p>
<p id="p-304">I don't, you know, things like that, but not something related to your life because that's going to break the connection and make you sound like a pretty negative or indecisive person.</p>
<p id="p-305">Yes, or using it, the other highlight, the situation that we highlighted is if you're trying to maintain, if it's actually useful to maintain the connection.</p>
<p id="p-306">If someone made a mistake and you want to make it clear that it doesn't matter to you, this would be the other scenario where it would be strategic to use I don't care.</p>
<p id="p-307">All the other scenarios we would avoid.</p>
<p id="p-308">All right, so that's the answer for our listener today.</p>
<p id="p-309">Awesome.</p>
<p id="p-310">All right.</p>
