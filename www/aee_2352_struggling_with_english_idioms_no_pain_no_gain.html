<p id="p-6">In today's episode, Alistair asks us about a common idiom to talk about overcoming obstacles and suffering through something to find success.</p>
<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p id="p-7">and suffering through something to find success in the end.</p>
<p id="p-8">Learn how to talk about this topic with three idioms today.</p>
<p id="p-9">Go, GX! Go, GX! Go, GX! Go, GX! GX stands for Green Transformation.</p>
<p id="p-10">Transformation to a greener society.</p>
<p id="p-11">A collaboration that aims to balance carbon removal and economic growth.</p>
<p id="p-12">Now is the time to bring Japanese technology to the world.</p>
<p id="p-13">GX is a chance for Japan.</p>
<p id="p-14">Let's support Shiro Tsuka.</p>
<p id="p-15">Go, GX Japan.</p>
<p id="p-16">Go, GX Japan.</p>
<p id="p-17">Hello, Lindsay, how are you today?</p>
<p id="p-18">Hey, Avery, I'm doing pretty well.</p>
<p id="p-19">How are you?</p>
<p id="p-20">I am great.</p>
<p id="p-21">I am wondering, do you ever lift weights?</p>
<p id="p-22">Actually, I do.</p>
<p id="p-23">I've been lifting weights a lot more in the last year or two years.</p>
<p id="p-24">Yeah, awesome.</p>
<p id="p-25">No pain, no gain, right?</p>
<p id="p-26">For sure.</p>
<p id="p-27">And sometimes it is painful, right?</p>
<p id="p-28">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-29">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-30">With pain comes gain, you could also say, right?</p>
<p id="p-31">With pain comes gain, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-32">Are you a weightlifter, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-33">I am not.</p>
<p id="p-34">I know I should.</p>
<p id="p-35">I should do this.</p>
<p id="p-36">I know I need to build more muscle, but I'm really bad about it.</p>
<p id="p-37">I don't have weights at my home and I don't have a gym membership, so it makes it a little trickier.</p>
<p id="p-38">You do it at a gym?</p>
<p id="p-39">I do it at Orange Theory.</p>
<p id="p-40">So I do Orange Theory.</p>
<p id="p-41">It kind of hit training and half of that or a third of that is weightlifting.</p>
<p id="p-42">I was really bad at it a couple of years too.</p>
<p id="p-43">And then I started reading that actually weightlifting is a way that you can burn calories.</p>
<p id="p-44">So when you have more muscle mass, apparently you burn calories faster.</p>
<p id="p-45">And I thought it was just I need to run and do cardio, but apparently those calories need a place to go.</p>
<p id="p-46">So they go to the muscle.</p>
<p id="p-47">I read that too.</p>
<p id="p-48">And then you can like burn calories while you're just sitting there, while you're sleeping.</p>
<p id="p-49">I know I need to lift weights better.</p>
<p id="p-50">But this came up because we had a listener ask about the idiom, no pain, no gain.</p>
<p id="p-51">So we are going to answer that question, but we want to make sure that you guys hit follow.</p>
<p id="p-52">We have taught a lot.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-53">follow.</p>
<p id="p-54">We have taught a lot of idioms here on the podcast, and we want to make sure you're not missing any of these episodes.</p>

<p id="p-56">They will be there waiting for you.</p>
<p id="p-57">That's how we get into the habit, and that's how we make sure we focus on connection when we're actually face-to-face with a native speaker or in a business context.</p>
<p id="p-58">Then we will know how to focus on the connection and build the relationships.</p>
<p id="p-59">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-60">That's what's most important, right?</p>
<p id="p-61">You are learning English to be able to connect with others in English, and that's what we focus on here.</p>
<p id="p-62">We always want to show you what's the connection point here, right?</p>
<p id="p-63">How can you connect with others with the vocab and the idioms we're teaching or the strategies?</p>
<p id="p-64">You got it.</p>
<p id="p-65">So, shall I go ahead and read the question from the listener again?</p>
<p id="p-66">Yeah, let's do it.</p>
<p id="p-67">All right.</p>
<p id="p-68">So, this is on YouTube, and don't forget, guys, we do have a YouTube channel.</p>
<p id="p-69">Hit subscribe over there if you prefer to see us on these episodes.</p>
<p id="p-70">This is from Shabnam Sureshnia759.</p>
<p id="p-71">The listener</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-72">The listener says, Hi, you're my favorite podcast.</p>
<p id="p-73">I have been listening for five years.</p>
<p id="p-74">That's amazing, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-75">That is awesome.</p>
<p id="p-76">It's so great to hear a long-time listeners in on listening today.</p>
<p id="p-77">I heard the phrase, no pain, no gain, and didn't know what it meant.</p>
<p id="p-78">Could you talk about it?</p>
<p id="p-79">Great one.</p>
<p id="p-80">Yes, this is a great one.</p>
<p id="p-81">So we are going to talk about this one and a couple of other related phrases.</p>
<p id="p-82">But I saw another question on YouTube that we're also answering today.</p>
<p id="p-83">This was h2go190, who just said, what are the most useful idioms for daily use?</p>
<p id="p-84">So all three that we're teaching today are useful for daily use.</p>
<p id="p-85">They're very common.</p>
<p id="p-86">You'll hear them a lot.</p>
<p id="p-87">But we also want to share that a lot of our past episodes, you can find really easy if you search the word idiom on our app in the search bar.</p>
<p id="p-88">And every time we teach idioms, we always share if they are a little outdated, if they are used commonly, because that is important to know.</p>
<p id="p-89">It's one thing to learn a list of idioms.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-90">it's one thing to learn a list of idioms, but you want to know, like, are these actually used in conversations?</p>
<p id="p-91">Totally.</p>
<p id="p-92">And I think a lot of textbooks are notorious for listing old idioms that just aren't used anymore.</p>
<p id="p-93">You don't want to sound like a textbook from the 90s.</p>
<p id="p-94">You don't want to sound like that.</p>
<p id="p-95">And so, making sure that you're listening to All Ears English, especially today, and going back and finding those other episodes will keep you in the know.</p>
<p id="p-96">All right.</p>
<p id="p-97">Good episode.</p>
<p id="p-98">Yeah, right.</p>
<p id="p-99">That phrase, keep in the know.</p>
<p id="p-100">It's a good one.</p>
<p id="p-101">In the know, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-102">Be sure to hit follow.</p>
<p id="p-103">We'll do a follow-up on that and other ways that we say that, that you're in the know.</p>
<p id="p-104">All right.</p>
<p id="p-105">Good.</p>
<p id="p-106">So, let's go to the first one that we used at the top of the show, no pain, no gain.</p>
<p id="p-107">What does this one mean, Ambre?</p>
<p id="p-108">Yeah, So, it means, like, suffering is necessary in order to achieve something.</p>
<p id="p-109">I actually was Googling about this because I guess it's a myth that you must have muscle pain in order to have gains.</p>
<p id="p-110">You can stay in, when you're lifting weights, you can stay in that more</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-111">stay in that more chill zone where you're not actually going to be sore the next day and still have gains.</p>
<p id="p-112">But we use this sort of metaphorically for life.</p>
<p id="p-113">That struggle doing something that's difficult is often going to give you worthwhile results.</p>
<p id="p-114">Oh, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-115">For sure.</p>
<p id="p-116">And I think this goes along with our work ethic in the U.S., right?</p>
<p id="p-117">So if you're running a business or something, working hard for future returns, that sort of idea.</p>
<p id="p-118">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-119">If a coworker is like complaining that things are really difficult, that you might just respond, well, no pain, no gain.</p>
<p id="p-120">It's actually sounds like you've got a lot going on, right?</p>
<p id="p-121">And kind of spin it in a positive way.</p>
<p id="p-122">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-123">So here are some sample sentences.</p>
<p id="p-124">I'm so sore from running this morning, but no pain, no gain.</p>
<p id="p-125">Yeah, this is often what we'll do.</p>
<p id="p-126">We're like, find ourselves complaining about something and immediately realize like, but I know it's going to have good results.</p>
<p id="p-127">So no pain, no gain.</p>
<p id="p-128">Right, It is funny.</p>
<p id="p-129">We do associate pain with progress or success later.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-130">with progress or success later.</p>
<p id="p-131">But it doesn't always have to be that way, but often it does, right, in life.</p>
<p id="p-132">You have to put in some kind of difficult work or struggle up the hill to get to the summit of the mountain, right?</p>
<p id="p-133">Exactly, right.</p>
<p id="p-134">There's usually at least some kind of struggle, something that's difficult in order to have good results, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-135">Yes, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-136">What's another sample?</p>
<p id="p-137">You might say, I've applied to hundreds of companies.</p>
<p id="p-138">It's such a grind, but no pain, no gain.</p>
<p id="p-139">This is a really good example, right?</p>
<p id="p-140">If you're having to apply to a lot of different places, it's a ton of work, a lot of effort, but you know that eventually you'll find the right fit.</p>
<p id="p-141">No pain, no gain.</p>
<p id="p-142">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-143">All right.</p>
<p id="p-144">So that's a good one.</p>
<p id="p-145">That one definitely is relevant, wouldn't you say, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-146">Fully relevant for a listener who asked, what are the common ones now?</p>
<p id="p-147">Yeah, Yeah, I hear this one.</p>
<p id="p-148">I use it.</p>
<p id="p-149">And I think this is such a great connection skill.</p>
<p id="p-150">If you are chatting with someone and they're maybe whining or venting, they're sharing something difficult they're going through.</p>
<p id="p-151">This is a great way to</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-152">going through, this is a great way to spin it and kind of remind them, like, but think about the results at the end of the journey.</p>
<p id="p-153">Yeah, it's so true.</p>
<p id="p-154">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-155">All right, what would be our second one?</p>
<p id="p-156">We have another one here.</p>
<p id="p-157">What is that?</p>
<p id="p-158">Yes, this has a similar meaning.</p>
<p id="p-159">It's what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.</p>
<p id="p-160">And same, right?</p>
<p id="p-161">With something difficult, if you take it literally, like, obviously, if it doesn't kill you, it's going, you know, but that means there's going to be a positive result.</p>
<p id="p-162">Right, And this could also be interpreted as what doesn't kill you makes you smarter or quicker or faster or better at something.</p>
<p id="p-163">Right, That's true.</p>
<p id="p-164">You could say any of those.</p>
<p id="p-165">Yeah, So, for example, had to replace my car's transmission and it was so expensive.</p>
<p id="p-166">I had to replace my car's transmission.</p>
<p id="p-167">Oh, transmissions can be very expensive.</p>
<p id="p-168">Yes, super pricey.</p>
<p id="p-169">And then we said, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, I guess.</p>
<p id="p-170">I don't know if that one applies.</p>
<p id="p-171">I think I would use it this way if I'm, like, frustrated that something costs a lot of money.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-172">that something cost a lot of money, right?</p>
<p id="p-173">I'm like, okay, I'm frustrated about this.</p>
<p id="p-174">This is super expensive.</p>
<p id="p-175">But what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right?</p>
<p id="p-176">I'm sort of trying to like refree in my mind instead of just being upset about how much I've had to pay.</p>
<p id="p-177">Like, but did you die?</p>
<p id="p-178">You know, I'm stronger for it.</p>
<p id="p-179">Right, I think it's the idea that raw life experience makes you better.</p>
<p id="p-180">So every experience, whether it's good or bad, is still raw life experience, right?</p>
<p id="p-181">Yeah, Or I might say I got food poisoning yesterday and was so sick, but what doesn't kill you makes what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, I guess.</p>
<p id="p-182">Oh God, these are bad scenarios, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-183">Bad scenarios.</p>
<p id="p-184">But did you die?</p>
<p id="p-185">Did you die?</p>
<p id="p-186">That's what you always have to say.</p>
<p id="p-187">Did you die?</p>
<p id="p-188">You're still alive.</p>
<p id="p-189">You're okay.</p>
<p id="p-190">Kind of trendy for someone to be like, but did you die?</p>
<p id="p-191">Is that trendy now?</p>
<p id="p-192">Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p id="p-193">I hear it a lot.</p>
<p id="p-194">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-195">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-196">You're complaining about something negative or something hard instead of like, no pain, no gain.</p>
<p id="p-197">That's another one of like, but did you die?</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-198">and they're like, but did you die?</p>
<p id="p-199">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-200">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-201">OK, I'm going to start using that in that case.</p>
<p id="p-202">Yes, do.</p>
<p id="p-203">All right.</p>
<p id="p-204">All right, what about number three?</p>
<p id="p-205">Fortune favors the bold.</p>
<p id="p-206">So those who take risks reap the benefits.</p>
<p id="p-207">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-208">There's no risk, no reward is another phrase that my dad used to always tell me, actually, because he was a small business owner.</p>
<p id="p-209">And no risk, no reward, 100%. And this one, both of those are a little bit different.</p>
<p id="p-210">They're not just about something that's happening to you that you might be frustrated.</p>
<p id="p-211">This isn't going to be about replacing a transmission.</p>
<p id="p-212">This is more like you're taking risks, you're proactively doing something difficult, and good results will follow.</p>
<p id="p-213">Yeah, and I think especially taking risks when it doesn't feel, it feels counterintuitive or it feels like you're scared.</p>
<p id="p-214">Doing the scary thing when you're already scared is often the right move.</p>
<p id="p-215">You know what I mean?</p>
<p id="p-216">That's often the right thing to do.</p>
<p id="p-217">And you don't figure it out until much later.</p>
<p id="p-218">But if you have a gut feeling, then.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-219">have a gut feeling, then you're on the right track.</p>
<p id="p-220">You know?</p>
<p id="p-221">For sure.</p>
<p id="p-222">Right?</p>
<p id="p-223">Yeah, You might say like with buying lottery tickets, right?</p>
<p id="p-224">I'm buying some lottery tickets this week.</p>
<p id="p-225">Fortune favors the bold.</p>
<p id="p-226">It's like you're taking a risk.</p>
<p id="p-227">That's a big risk.</p>
<p id="p-228">Yeah, A couple dollars.</p>
<p id="p-229">Yeah, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-230">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-231">And then we could say fortune favors the bold.</p>
<p id="p-232">So our company is acquiring a competitor.</p>
<p id="p-233">Yeah, You're being aggressive.</p>
<p id="p-234">You're not caving in on yourself as a company and hoping to win.</p>
<p id="p-235">Instead, you're going after your competitors, acquiring them, and being aggressive.</p>
<p id="p-236">So being aggressive when you think you should be defensive.</p>
<p id="p-237">What is that expression that Warren Buffett has?</p>
<p id="p-238">He always says, you know, when others are being fearful, or what is it that he says?</p>
<p id="p-239">Do you know that?</p>
<p id="p-240">No.</p>
<p id="p-241">Cool.</p>
<p id="p-242">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-243">He says something like, when others are being fearful, you should be aggressive and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-244">And then the opposite of that.</p>
<p id="p-245">Vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-246">Oh, that's really good.</p>
<p id="p-247">So our listeners can look it up.</p>
<p id="p-248">Good advice.</p>
<p id="p-249">It's so good.</p>
<p id="p-250">It's so good.</p>
<p id="p-251">It's so true.</p>
<p id="p-252">Right?</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-253">competitors kind of hedging their bets, that's the time to be aggressive, maybe take advantage of the situation.</p>
<p id="p-254">That's often how you're going to get ahead.</p>
<p id="p-255">Yeah, 100%. All right, Aubrey, let's roll into a role play, shall we?</p>
<p id="p-256">So here, what's our scenario?</p>
<p id="p-257">You and I are neighbors that run into each other on the sidewalk, both going for a walk.</p>
<p id="p-258">Okay, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-259">Hey there, going for a run?</p>
<p id="p-260">Yep, no pain, no gain.</p>
<p id="p-261">I heard you're training for a marathon.</p>
<p id="p-262">Oh yes, I am, it's in June.</p>
<p id="p-263">Ooh, better you than me.</p>
<p id="p-264">They say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, but I think a marathon would kill me.</p>
<p id="p-265">It'd kill me if I tried to run one today.</p>
<p id="p-266">It'd kill me if I tried to run one today.</p>
<p id="p-267">Definitely takes a lot of training.</p>
<p id="p-268">Well, I'm impressed you're going for it.</p>
<p id="p-269">Fortune favors the bold.</p>
<p id="p-270">Yeah, yeah, for sure for a marathon, we can't just walk out our door and start running.</p>
<p id="p-271">Imagine, no.</p>
<p id="p-272">Unless you're Forrest Gump or something, you know, he did that, I guess.</p>
<p id="p-273">It takes a lot of training for the average person.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-274">of training for the average person.</p>
<p id="p-275">For sure.</p>
<p id="p-276">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-277">All right.</p>
<p id="p-278">Let's break this down.</p>
<p id="p-279">So you said, hey, they're going for a run.</p>
<p id="p-280">Yeah, And you said, no pain, no gain.</p>
<p id="p-281">So this is a fun way to respond, right?</p>
<p id="p-282">It's playful.</p>
<p id="p-283">It's like, yep.</p>
<p id="p-284">You know, it's because when someone says like going for a run and when you run into a neighbor like this on a sidewalk, it can be awkward.</p>
<p id="p-285">It's like, what do I say?</p>
<p id="p-286">I want to say hello, but they're clearly going for a run.</p>
<p id="p-287">We're not going to have a long conversation.</p>
<p id="p-288">This is a great way to connect.</p>
<p id="p-289">Just be like, oh, going for a run.</p>
<p id="p-290">Yeah, No pain, no gain.</p>
<p id="p-291">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-292">You don't want to show any signs that you're trying to engage them in too much conversation because they might be busy.</p>
<p id="p-293">They might want to not break their rhythm of the run.</p>
<p id="p-294">So there's a privacy aspect here, right?</p>
<p id="p-295">That's a real value in American culture.</p>
<p id="p-296">We don't want to kind of like insert ourselves too much if someone already has a routine going.</p>
<p id="p-297">Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-298">And this is interesting because this role play would branch depending on how the person responds.</p>
<p id="p-299">If they say, yep, no pain, no gain.</p>
<p id="p-300">And keep</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-301">If they say, yep, no pain, no gain, and keep running, you'd be like, bye, have fun.</p>
<p id="p-302">That's it.</p>
<p id="p-303">The conversation would end, right?</p>
<p id="p-304">But if they, you know, they've stopped and they clearly are like, oh, I kind of want to catch up for a second, or maybe they're running in place.</p>
<p id="p-305">You could be like, I heard you're training for a marathon.</p>
<p id="p-306">It's still going to be a pretty brief conversation, but you can have a little bit of a back and forth.</p>
<p id="p-307">Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p id="p-308">So just kind of keeping in mind what's going on in the context.</p>
<p id="p-309">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-310">And then you said, better you than me.</p>
<p id="p-311">They say, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, but I think a marathon would kill me.</p>
<p id="p-312">And what's the intonation there for our listeners, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-313">But I think a marathon would definitely emphasize would, would kill me, right?</p>
<p id="p-314">Yes, Yeah, And this is a fun way to use this, right?</p>
<p id="p-315">To kind of say that you don't believe this is true.</p>
<p id="p-316">They say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, but, and then whatever it is that you don't want to participate, skydiving, scuba diving, something to be like, but I'm actually worried that I would die.</p>
<p id="p-317">Yes, I love it.</p>
<p id="p-318">And then you said, Aubrey, what's the last thing you said?</p>
<p id="p-319">I said, well,</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-320">Aubrey what's the last thing you said?</p>
<p id="p-321">I said, well, I'm impressed you're going for it.</p>
<p id="p-322">Fortune favors the bold.</p>
<p id="p-323">And this is great.</p>
<p id="p-324">If you find out someone's running a marathon or doing something that is a huge challenge or taking on a risk, what a great thing to say.</p>
<p id="p-325">What a good way to connect to compliment them this way.</p>
<p id="p-326">Fortune favors the bold.</p>
<p id="p-327">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-328">And then the next time you see them, the way to build that connection is check in on that marathon training, right?</p>
<p id="p-329">How's it going?</p>
<p id="p-330">I see the marathons coming up.</p>
<p id="p-331">Are you ready?</p>
<p id="p-332">Oh yeah.</p>
<p id="p-333">How are your training sessions been?</p>

<p id="p-337">We want to share a recent episode 2319.</p>
<p id="p-338">If you missed it, scroll up.</p>
<p id="p-339">It was where's that from?</p>
<p id="p-340">How to ask about an idiom's origin.</p>
<p id="p-341">So not only can you use idioms in your conversations, you can also ask if someone knows where they're from, information about them.</p>
<p id="p-342">That's a fun conversation too.</p>
<p id="p-343">Yeah, And for a takeaway today, Aubrey, I love this topic.</p>
<p id="p-344">This topic that success requires a little bit of suffering.</p>
<p id="p-345">I think it's true.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-346">I think it's true, you know, and this could be a great conversation starter for our listeners to go into, you know, their choice of a career path, their visions for the future.</p>
<p id="p-347">Lots of conversation starters here, right?</p>
<p id="p-348">Yeah, with the start of the new year, you might be deciding to take more risks, to do something exciting and challenging, and it's a great thing to ask others about, right?</p>
<p id="p-349">What are you doing this year that scares you that, you know, you feel like is going to be challenging?</p>
<p id="p-350">What a fun conversation.</p>
<p id="p-351">And we all should have an answer for that, right?</p>
<p id="p-352">Even if we're not going through major life changes, it's always good to be doing, and I should take my own advice, it's always good to be doing something that scares us a little bit, right?</p>
<p id="p-353">Yeah, push ourselves a little bit.</p>
<p id="p-354">Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-355">I love it.</p>
