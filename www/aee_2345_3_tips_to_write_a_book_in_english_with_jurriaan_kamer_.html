<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p>three key tools.</p>
<p>Get the information and the inspiration so that your book, too, can reach the entire world in today's episode.</p>
<p>Hello Uriane, how are you today?</p>
<p>Welcome to the show.</p>
<p>I'm doing really well, Lindsay.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me.</p>
<p>Very glad to have you here.</p>
<p>I'm going to take a minute and introduce you to our audience and then we will get into our chat.</p>
<p>So everyone, today I have Uriane Calmer on the show, who is an organizational change expert based in Utrecht, Netherlands.</p>
<p>Not sure if I got that right.</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>That was perfect.</p>
<p>Not too bad.</p>
<p>In Dutch we say Utrecht, which is like this weird, weird thing.</p>
<p>So yeah, that's fine.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>And over the last decade, Uriane has worked as a speaker and author and a consultant.</p>
<p>He co-founded Unblock, a modern management consultancy that works with leaders worldwide.</p>
<p>And he recently published his latest book called Unblock, Clear the Way for Results and Development.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>clear the way for results, and develop a thriving organization.</p>
<p>Welcome again, Jorian.</p>
<p>I love the fact that you are really involved directly in the business world, especially as a consultant.</p>
<p>You probably see a lot in the business world on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's different countries, different cultures, different company cultures, so language is always a thing I wrestle with and tinker with.</p>
<p>I know, just off the top of my head, just one question about consulting I wanna ask you before we get into writing.</p>
<p>What would you say is the biggest theme that comes up as a consultant when you help companies?</p>
<p>What's one of the major themes that tends to come up across industries that professionals tend to struggle with or want to improve?</p>
<p>Is there one theme that comes up broadly?</p>
<p>Yeah, so depending on who you ask in the organization, if you start at the top, people will say strategy execution is very difficult.</p>
<p>If you go a step down, people that are in the front lines, they're suffering from meeting overload.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Just being drowning in meetings and if you're somewhere in the middle.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>just being drowning in meetings.</p>
<p>And if you're somewhere in the middle, people will say that, you know, decision-making is very slow.</p>
<p>So, and those three things are interconnected, as you can imagine.</p>
<p>Interesting, I think a lot of those themes are gonna resonate very well with our listeners here, whether they are working in English or their native language.</p>
<p>But today we're here, Urian, to talk about writing, specifically writing in English.</p>
<p>Now, Urian, English is your second language.</p>
<p>However, you speak very fluently, near native in my mind.</p>
<p>And I know that you wrote a book in English.</p>
<p>Can you tell us a little bit about your latest book, Unblock?</p>
<p>Yeah, so Unblock is all about unblocking organizations and helping leaders overcome some of those challenges.</p>
<p>I already mentioned three of them, and there's three more in the book.</p>
<p>And yeah, it's a practical guide for leaders that wanna accelerate results and, you know, get better.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>And was there, why did you decide to write it in English?</p>
<p>That's my first question for you.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course, yeah.</p>
<p>So I've been working internationally across the globe.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>internationally across the globe for a long time.</p>
<p>Only about a third of the people that follow my work are Dutch and two thirds are in the rest of the world.</p>
<p>A third is roughly U.S. and U.K. and there's a third outside of that as well.</p>
<p>Okay, so it made sense.</p>
<p>English is the international language of business at this point in time, so it did make sense.</p>
<p>Was this the first book that you wrote in English or was your previous book also in English?</p>
<p>So the previous book I wrote in Dutch first and then I translated it and made it available in English.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>And this time I just wrote it in English.</p>
<p>I only wrote it in English and I'm still considering if I will ever translate it to Dutch or not.</p>
<p>And one factor is that most people that work in the Netherlands and work in business, they also read English, so they're fine with that.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Did you feel like anything was lost having to write it in English?</p>
<p>Were there any nuances that were harder to convey?</p>
<p>When you made that decision to write in English?</p>
<p>Not so much.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>to write in English?</p>
<p>Not so much, actually, because a lot of the material and a lot of the clients I work with, that's already in English.</p>
<p>Although it was sometimes harder to express myself, right?</p>
<p>If you really want to convey an idea, it's always easier to do that in your mother tongue.</p>
<p>So sometimes I had to kind of figure out, like, how do I say this?</p>
<p>What's the word?</p>
<p>Like, I don't have the real word for it.</p>
<p>But yeah, but I think like a lot of the business words are already, you know, there's a lot of jargon in the work we do, like these special words and like these business type words.</p>
<p>So it might even be harder to translate them to Dutch because the Dutch people also use the English version sometimes.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love that.</p>
<p>So the why here is, you know, we're thinking about writing a book or writing anything, going to the method of writing it in English could open up doors and send the book global, right?</p>
<p>Rather than just within our own country.</p>
<p>That sounds like a really good motivating factor to push ourselves out of our comfort zone.</p>
<p>Don't you think, Absolutely.</p>
<p>And these days with, with the tools that are available with Amazon,</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>tools that are available with Amazon self-publishing, you can upload a PDF and everybody in the world can buy your book.</p>
<p>Like that's a good thing about these days.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I have a feeling some of our listeners might be curious what we're saying today.</p>
<p>There may be a dream that they've been just pushing under the rug and ignoring, they've always wanted to write something in English, whether it's a report or a book or a novel or something.</p>
<p>I have a feeling some of our listeners have that dream.</p>
<p>So Jurijan, can you tell us, you mentioned that you have three tips on how you accomplish this, right?</p>
<p>You didn't just sit down and just write the book one day.</p>
<p>You had to use tactics and strategies to get this done.</p>
<p>Can you tell us what was one tactic that you used to do this?</p>
<p>Yeah, the first one is to get the right tools in place.</p>
<p>So what really helped was to use Grammarly as a writing assistant, just to make sure that what I was writing was cohesive and didn't contain lots of spelling mistakes or grammar mistakes.</p>
<p>It's just like a writing assistant and I kind of.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>a writing assistant.</p>
<p>And I sometimes complimented that by using ChatGPT to unpack different ways of saying things.</p>
<p>Grammarly is great, but ChatGPT can go a little bit beyond and you can just put in a few phrases and like, I don't know, I want to have five different ways of saying this.</p>
<p>Can you help me out?</p>
<p>And then they will give you ideas.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So using some kind of assistant, maybe combining What A Dream Team, Grammarly, and ChatGPT, right?</p>
<p>I love that idea.</p>
<p>Yeah, I've played around with Grammarly a little bit, the email plugin, where it will correct, you know, if you're making, you need a comma or something or a period or something is misspelled in an email, even though I teach English, sometimes I make mistakes.</p>
<p>We are all about connection, not perfection here.</p>
<p>We all make mistakes.</p>
<p>It's normal.</p>
<p>And so having that assistant, do you also use Grammarly in your emails too or in any other capacity?</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, In my emails, in my, in my social media posts, like it's, it's everywhere and my plugin and that's helpful.</p>
<p>That's helpful because I sometimes.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>That's helpful because I sometimes just, you know, I write something down and it doesn't come out right, but I think it's okay.</p>
<p>And then Grammarly just gives me a better version.</p>
<p>I'm like, oh yeah, that's better.</p>
<p>Let's use that.</p>
<p>Yeah, That's so smart.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>So look, this tool is so available.</p>
<p>It is so easy to get started with Grammarly.</p>
<p>We've talked about it before on the show.</p>
<p>So that is a great first tip, Jorian, to go ahead and install Grammarly and use that as a tool.</p>
<p>Get used to using it before you start writing whatever you're going to write in English.</p>
<p>What would be your second tip, Jorian?</p>
<p>Yeah, I relied heavily on beta reading, meaning that I collected people that are interested in my work and asked them if they were willing to read early versions of my manuscript.</p>
<p>You can do that using Google Docs and opening up your documents.</p>
<p>But I actually use a platform which is called helpthisbook.com, which is a tool that allows you to, even with lower thresholds than Google Doc, like Google Doc for some people can be difficult to use.</p>
<p>Right, Yeah, there's ways to do it.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>Um, yeah, there's, there's, there's ways to do it.</p>
<p>And the main thing that I did, like, here's a new chapter, tell me what you think and tell me what part is confusing.</p>
<p>Tell me what part you love.</p>
<p>Tell me what part you have a question about, or you have a different experience about.</p>
<p>Yeah, And that's important because a book is only helpful if it actually resonates with the target audience that you have in mind and that in terms of language, it's important to use the right words.</p>
<p>So if I use an example that is just, that's easy for, I don't know, people in the U S or in Germany or in the Netherlands to understand, but people in Italy are like, I don't get this thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, That's really important to know as early as possible.</p>
<p>Um, yeah.</p>
<p>Right, That's a really good point.</p>
<p>Especially for nonfiction books, right?</p>
<p>Business books where you're probably bringing in case studies, I would imagine into your books.</p>
<p>Yeah, Case studies, examples.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wonder if people use that for fiction books as well.</p>
<p>I'm curious because it's a very different process.</p>
<p>Do you know if people use beta readers for fiction books?</p>
<p>Probably but it might be different.</p>
<p>It might be a different.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>Probably, but it might be different.</p>
<p>It might be a different process for doing it.</p>
<p>I really use it to figure out, is my book working for readers?</p>
<p>Does it give them value and how much value is every section giving them?</p>
<p>And in terms of language, there's so many different examples you can use.</p>
<p>What are the examples that resonate with my audience in Europe versus in other places?</p>
<p>Oh, that makes so much sense.</p>
<p>So it's not just about the concepts in the book.</p>
<p>It's about the way you're conveying it because you're writing in English as a second language.</p>
<p>It becomes even more important to make sure this is truly resonating or did something get lost in translation.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, And if you go even further, the title and the subtitle of the book is some of the hardest writing I've ever done.</p>
<p>I've had over a thousand variations.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>I think there's the curse of these tools, especially like ChatGPT.</p>
<p>It can generate so many options that you get overwhelmed.</p>
<p>And I've used some versions which, for example,</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>For example, move the needle is an expression that resonates with some people in terms of getting better business outcomes, but a lot of people are like, I don't know what move the needle means.</p>
<p>Don't put that on the title because I'm going to get confused what the book is about.</p>
<p>Right, So you couldn't use an idiom like that.</p>
<p>You couldn't use a business idiom like that, but that really resonates with an American business audience, but maybe not a British audience or maybe not an Indian audience or other audiences around the world.</p>
<p>That makes total sense.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>And then you generated a thousand different title options.</p>
<p>Yeah, I got completely lost in that.</p>
<p>I did use, I did use some polls on LinkedIn to show different options and to get some feedback.</p>
<p>And I mean, the problem, the problem with feedback, I mean, feedback is awesome, but you can also drown in it.</p>
<p>In the end you have to make your own choice.</p>
<p>Oh, you have to have a center of gravity or a gut feeling a bit of that within yourself.</p>
<p>Right, Or, and also to understand what is your vision for this book?</p>
<p>Because everyone has their own vision for your product.</p>
<p>Yeah, Exactly.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>Yeah, Exactly.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I love this.</p>
<p>Well, I like your approach because it seems like in my mind, my bias towards writing books is that people are in their office with a, with a pot of coffee and just communicating with their editor for a year at a time.</p>
<p>And maybe that's how some people do it.</p>
<p>But now we have these incredible tools.</p>
<p>We can crowdsource the creation of the book in a sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah, So smart.</p>
<p>What would be the third thing you're on that you did?</p>
<p>Yeah, So I went toward the end, uh, actually toward the end when, when the first conversion was complete of the manuscript.</p>
<p>And then I get, got onto Readsie, which is a platform that allows you to hire freelancers that are really, that are helpful for, for book product, for book production.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>Um, and, um, uh, I, I found a professional editor.</p>
<p>Um, however, um, when you find, you know, there's thousands of professional editors out there and I was really looking for one per one that was, um, I think in the end she was U S native.</p>
<p>She was born in the U S she lived in the UK.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>born in the US, she lived in the UK, but did a lot of editing for international audiences.</p>
<p>That was so important because she wouldn't add any, you know, pop references or film references that in other places people don't know about.</p>
<p>And she was really good at spotting some of those things, so that was helpful.</p>
<p>Yeah, that is so important.</p>
<p>Who you hire to be on your team, it really matters and their perspective, how open are they?</p>
<p>What are their blind spots?</p>
<p>That's one thing I've become more and more aware of, blind spots, and do people recognize their blind spots the second time or the third time they come up?</p>
<p>So important.</p>
<p>I love this.</p>
<p>I love this.</p>
<p>So just to summarize, did you want to say something else, Irian?</p>
<p>Yeah, I wanted to add, like, what was surprising to me, that was the first time I learned that that's actually the process, is that she made a style guide.</p>
<p>So, of course, I had to tell her, do we use British spelling or American spelling?</p>
<p>But even further, it's like, when she was working on the first few chapters, she figured out how I like to do it.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>few chapters, she figured out how I like to phrase things.</p>
<p>And sometimes she wanted to change something and I pushed back and said, actually, no, I'd love to say it in this way.</p>
<p>And she created a style guide for herself, which then helped us, you know, get the whole book through.</p>
<p>That is so smart.</p>
<p>So she was process oriented, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, And I think what I learned from that is that there's no one right, correct way to write English.</p>
<p>Like there's their styles.</p>
<p>And yeah, I didn't know that.</p>
<p>So it was interesting.</p>
<p>So what did you go with in terms of spelling conventions?</p>
<p>Did you do UK, US or a blend, create your own kind of blend of the spelling?</p>
<p>For me, a blend wouldn't work.</p>
<p>I think, I mean, even the word, even like the word organization, you cannot spell it with an S or a Z across the book.</p>
<p>Right, But yeah.</p>
<p>So we went for US based spelling and that's because that's my, I wouldn't say, yeah, that's, that's how I write.</p>
<p>Funny enough.</p>
<p>But then she, she had some things in there about, about things being sometimes informal.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>things being sometimes informal.</p>
<p>It's also about quotation marks, like where to put them.</p>
<p>Yeah, Because there's choices there.</p>
<p>I didn't know that it existed.</p>
<p>Like when you use Grammarly, it will tell you there's one right way, you know, it will correct it.</p>
<p>But you can have variations, like do you put the dot inside or outside of the quotation marks?</p>
<p>Like those are some of those things.</p>
<p>Yeah, Do you know if when you install Grammarly, I'm curious, I don't know, can you choose UK English or US English?</p>
<p>Do you know if that's an option?</p>
<p>You can.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay, perfect.</p>
<p>But I'm not sure there's many other options than that.</p>
<p>It's pretty binary.</p>
<p>Yeah, Got it.</p>
<p>Okay, this is good.</p>
<p>I feel like I've learned a lot.</p>
<p>And I really think that our listeners, again, for our listeners, I'll speak directly to our listeners now, everyone, if you have a dream of writing a book, or writing something, maybe it's a murder mystery novel, you know, think about writing it in English, because the journey would make you a better speaker in the end.</p>
<p>And it's just a journey that where you could push yourself to grow as a person, you're on any final pieces of advice or words of wisdom when it comes to writing.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>or words of wisdom when it comes to writing in English for our listeners?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say with the tools that are available these days, don't let it hold you back.</p>
<p>Yeah, You know, it's really not that hard anymore.</p>
<p>You can always still write drafts in your own language and then throw it through ChatGPT to get it translated.</p>
<p>Yeah, But in the end, writing in English does have a lot of advantages.</p>
<p>And as a final advice, do get professional help before you publish, which is the editor part.</p>
<p>Yes, 100%, so resourceful.</p>
<p>I love this.</p>
<p>Urien, where can our listeners find you online if they want to reach out to you or would like to learn more, maybe see your book, take a look at your book?</p>
<p>Yeah, so my book is at www.unblockbook.net.</p>
<p>It's on Amazon.</p>
<p>And if people wanna connect with me, the best way to do that is through my LinkedIn profile.</p>
<p>Excellent, wonderful.</p>

<p>And I'm excited to see your next book.</p>
<p>Do you have any plans for another one to come out or are you just taking a break for now?</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p>taking a break for now.</p>
<p>I think it's a once every five-year thing for me, so I'm definitely not ready to write my next one.</p>
<p>Okay, not quite there yet, but you'll get there, I'm sure.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yes, Thank you, Lindsay.</p>
