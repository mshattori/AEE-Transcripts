<p id="p-13">Hello Uriane, how are you today?</p>
<p id="p-14">Welcome to the show.</p>
<p id="p-15">I'm doing really well, Lindsay.</p>
<p id="p-16">Thank you for having me.</p>
<p id="p-17">Very glad to have you here.</p>
<p id="p-18">I'm going to take a minute and introduce you to our audience and then we will get into our chat.</p>
<p id="p-19">So everyone, today I have Uriane Calmer on the show, who is an organizational change expert based in Utrecht, Netherlands.</p>
<p id="p-20">Not sure if I got that right.</p>
<p id="p-21">Probably not.</p>
<p id="p-22">That was perfect.</p>
<p id="p-23">Not too bad.</p>
<p id="p-24">In Dutch we say Utrecht, which is like this weird, weird thing.</p>
<p id="p-25">So yeah, that's fine.</p>
<p id="p-26">Excellent.</p>
<p id="p-27">And over the last decade, Uriane has worked as a speaker and author and a consultant.</p>
<p id="p-28">He co-founded Unblock, a modern management consultancy that works with leaders worldwide.</p>
<p id="p-29">And he recently published his latest book called Unblock, Clear the Way for Results and Development.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-30">clear the way for results, and develop a thriving organization.</p>
<p id="p-31">Welcome again, Jorian.</p>
<p id="p-32">I love the fact that you are really involved directly in the business world, especially as a consultant.</p>
<p id="p-33">You probably see a lot in the business world on a daily basis.</p>
<p id="p-34">Yeah, it's different countries, different cultures, different company cultures, so language is always a thing I wrestle with and tinker with.</p>
<p id="p-35">I know, just off the top of my head, just one question about consulting I wanna ask you before we get into writing.</p>
<p id="p-36">What would you say is the biggest theme that comes up as a consultant when you help companies?</p>
<p id="p-37">What's one of the major themes that tends to come up across industries that professionals tend to struggle with or want to improve?</p>
<p id="p-38">Is there one theme that comes up broadly?</p>
<p id="p-39">Yeah, so depending on who you ask in the organization, if you start at the top, people will say strategy execution is very difficult.</p>
<p id="p-40">If you go a step down, people that are in the front lines, they're suffering from meeting overload.</p>
<p id="p-41">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-42">Just being drowning in meetings and if you're somewhere in the middle.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-43">just being drowning in meetings.</p>
<p id="p-44">And if you're somewhere in the middle, people will say that, you know, decision-making is very slow.</p>
<p id="p-45">So, and those three things are interconnected, as you can imagine.</p>
<p id="p-46">Interesting, I think a lot of those themes are gonna resonate very well with our listeners here, whether they are working in English or their native language.</p>
<p id="p-47">But today we're here, Urian, to talk about writing, specifically writing in English.</p>
<p id="p-48">Now, Urian, English is your second language.</p>
<p id="p-49">However, you speak very fluently, near native in my mind.</p>
<p id="p-50">And I know that you wrote a book in English.</p>
<p id="p-51">Can you tell us a little bit about your latest book, Unblock?</p>
<p id="p-52">Yeah, so Unblock is all about unblocking organizations and helping leaders overcome some of those challenges.</p>
<p id="p-53">I already mentioned three of them, and there's three more in the book.</p>
<p id="p-54">And yeah, it's a practical guide for leaders that wanna accelerate results and, you know, get better.</p>
<p id="p-55">I see.</p>
<p id="p-56">And was there, why did you decide to write it in English?</p>
<p id="p-57">That's my first question for you.</p>
<p id="p-58">Yeah, of course, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-59">So I've been working internationally across the globe.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-60">internationally across the globe for a long time.</p>
<p id="p-61">Only about a third of the people that follow my work are Dutch and two thirds are in the rest of the world.</p>
<p id="p-62">A third is roughly U.S. and U.K. and there's a third outside of that as well.</p>
<p id="p-63">Okay, so it made sense.</p>
<p id="p-64">English is the international language of business at this point in time, so it did make sense.</p>
<p id="p-65">Was this the first book that you wrote in English or was your previous book also in English?</p>
<p id="p-66">So the previous book I wrote in Dutch first and then I translated it and made it available in English.</p>
<p id="p-67">I see.</p>
<p id="p-68">And this time I just wrote it in English.</p>
<p id="p-69">I only wrote it in English and I'm still considering if I will ever translate it to Dutch or not.</p>
<p id="p-70">And one factor is that most people that work in the Netherlands and work in business, they also read English, so they're fine with that.</p>
<p id="p-71">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-72">Did you feel like anything was lost having to write it in English?</p>
<p id="p-73">Were there any nuances that were harder to convey?</p>
<p id="p-74">When you made that decision to write in English?</p>
<p id="p-75">Not so much.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-76">to write in English?</p>
<p id="p-77">Not so much, actually, because a lot of the material and a lot of the clients I work with, that's already in English.</p>
<p id="p-78">Although it was sometimes harder to express myself, right?</p>
<p id="p-79">If you really want to convey an idea, it's always easier to do that in your mother tongue.</p>
<p id="p-80">So sometimes I had to kind of figure out, like, how do I say this?</p>
<p id="p-81">What's the word?</p>
<p id="p-82">Like, I don't have the real word for it.</p>
<p id="p-83">But yeah, but I think like a lot of the business words are already, you know, there's a lot of jargon in the work we do, like these special words and like these business type words.</p>
<p id="p-84">So it might even be harder to translate them to Dutch because the Dutch people also use the English version sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-85">Yeah, I love that.</p>
<p id="p-86">So the why here is, you know, we're thinking about writing a book or writing anything, going to the method of writing it in English could open up doors and send the book global, right?</p>
<p id="p-87">Rather than just within our own country.</p>
<p id="p-88">That sounds like a really good motivating factor to push ourselves out of our comfort zone.</p>
<p id="p-89">Don't you think, Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-90">And these days with, with the tools that are available with Amazon,</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-91">tools that are available with Amazon self-publishing, you can upload a PDF and everybody in the world can buy your book.</p>
<p id="p-92">Like that's a good thing about these days.</p>
<p id="p-93">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-94">I have a feeling some of our listeners might be curious what we're saying today.</p>
<p id="p-95">There may be a dream that they've been just pushing under the rug and ignoring, they've always wanted to write something in English, whether it's a report or a book or a novel or something.</p>
<p id="p-96">I have a feeling some of our listeners have that dream.</p>
<p id="p-97">So Jurijan, can you tell us, you mentioned that you have three tips on how you accomplish this, right?</p>
<p id="p-98">You didn't just sit down and just write the book one day.</p>
<p id="p-99">You had to use tactics and strategies to get this done.</p>
<p id="p-100">Can you tell us what was one tactic that you used to do this?</p>
<p id="p-101">Yeah, the first one is to get the right tools in place.</p>
<p id="p-102">So what really helped was to use Grammarly as a writing assistant, just to make sure that what I was writing was cohesive and didn't contain lots of spelling mistakes or grammar mistakes.</p>
<p id="p-103">It's just like a writing assistant and I kind of.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-104">a writing assistant.</p>
<p id="p-105">And I sometimes complimented that by using ChatGPT to unpack different ways of saying things.</p>
<p id="p-106">Grammarly is great, but ChatGPT can go a little bit beyond and you can just put in a few phrases and like, I don't know, I want to have five different ways of saying this.</p>
<p id="p-107">Can you help me out?</p>
<p id="p-108">And then they will give you ideas.</p>
<p id="p-109">Amazing.</p>
<p id="p-110">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-111">So using some kind of assistant, maybe combining What A Dream Team, Grammarly, and ChatGPT, right?</p>
<p id="p-112">I love that idea.</p>
<p id="p-113">Yeah, I've played around with Grammarly a little bit, the email plugin, where it will correct, you know, if you're making, you need a comma or something or a period or something is misspelled in an email, even though I teach English, sometimes I make mistakes.</p>
<p id="p-114">We are all about connection, not perfection here.</p>
<p id="p-115">We all make mistakes.</p>
<p id="p-116">It's normal.</p>
<p id="p-117">And so having that assistant, do you also use Grammarly in your emails too or in any other capacity?</p>
<p id="p-118">Yeah, Yeah, In my emails, in my, in my social media posts, like it's, it's everywhere and my plugin and that's helpful.</p>
<p id="p-119">That's helpful because I sometimes.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-120">That's helpful because I sometimes just, you know, I write something down and it doesn't come out right, but I think it's okay.</p>
<p id="p-121">And then Grammarly just gives me a better version.</p>
<p id="p-122">I'm like, oh yeah, that's better.</p>
<p id="p-123">Let's use that.</p>
<p id="p-124">Yeah, That's so smart.</p>
<p id="p-125">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-126">So look, this tool is so available.</p>
<p id="p-127">It is so easy to get started with Grammarly.</p>
<p id="p-128">We've talked about it before on the show.</p>
<p id="p-129">So that is a great first tip, Jorian, to go ahead and install Grammarly and use that as a tool.</p>
<p id="p-130">Get used to using it before you start writing whatever you're going to write in English.</p>
<p id="p-131">What would be your second tip, Jorian?</p>
<p id="p-132">Yeah, I relied heavily on beta reading, meaning that I collected people that are interested in my work and asked them if they were willing to read early versions of my manuscript.</p>
<p id="p-133">You can do that using Google Docs and opening up your documents.</p>
<p id="p-134">But I actually use a platform which is called helpthisbook.com, which is a tool that allows you to, even with lower thresholds than Google Doc, like Google Doc for some people can be difficult to use.</p>
<p id="p-135">Right, Yeah, there's ways to do it.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-136">Um, yeah, there's, there's, there's ways to do it.</p>
<p id="p-137">And the main thing that I did, like, here's a new chapter, tell me what you think and tell me what part is confusing.</p>
<p id="p-138">Tell me what part you love.</p>
<p id="p-139">Tell me what part you have a question about, or you have a different experience about.</p>
<p id="p-140">Yeah, And that's important because a book is only helpful if it actually resonates with the target audience that you have in mind and that in terms of language, it's important to use the right words.</p>
<p id="p-141">So if I use an example that is just, that's easy for, I don't know, people in the U S or in Germany or in the Netherlands to understand, but people in Italy are like, I don't get this thing.</p>
<p id="p-142">Yeah, That's really important to know as early as possible.</p>
<p id="p-143">Um, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-144">Right, That's a really good point.</p>
<p id="p-145">Especially for nonfiction books, right?</p>
<p id="p-146">Business books where you're probably bringing in case studies, I would imagine into your books.</p>
<p id="p-147">Yeah, Case studies, examples.</p>
<p id="p-148">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-149">Yeah, I wonder if people use that for fiction books as well.</p>
<p id="p-150">I'm curious because it's a very different process.</p>
<p id="p-151">Do you know if people use beta readers for fiction books?</p>
<p id="p-152">Probably but it might be different.</p>
<p id="p-153">It might be a different.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-154">Probably, but it might be different.</p>
<p id="p-155">It might be a different process for doing it.</p>
<p id="p-156">I really use it to figure out, is my book working for readers?</p>
<p id="p-157">Does it give them value and how much value is every section giving them?</p>
<p id="p-158">And in terms of language, there's so many different examples you can use.</p>
<p id="p-159">What are the examples that resonate with my audience in Europe versus in other places?</p>
<p id="p-160">Oh, that makes so much sense.</p>
<p id="p-161">So it's not just about the concepts in the book.</p>
<p id="p-162">It's about the way you're conveying it because you're writing in English as a second language.</p>
<p id="p-163">It becomes even more important to make sure this is truly resonating or did something get lost in translation.</p>
<p id="p-164">Right?</p>
<p id="p-165">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-166">Yeah, And if you go even further, the title and the subtitle of the book is some of the hardest writing I've ever done.</p>
<p id="p-167">I've had over a thousand variations.</p>
<p id="p-168">Really?</p>
<p id="p-169">I think there's the curse of these tools, especially like ChatGPT.</p>
<p id="p-170">It can generate so many options that you get overwhelmed.</p>
<p id="p-171">And I've used some versions which, for example,</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-172">For example, move the needle is an expression that resonates with some people in terms of getting better business outcomes, but a lot of people are like, I don't know what move the needle means.</p>
<p id="p-173">Don't put that on the title because I'm going to get confused what the book is about.</p>
<p id="p-174">Right, So you couldn't use an idiom like that.</p>
<p id="p-175">You couldn't use a business idiom like that, but that really resonates with an American business audience, but maybe not a British audience or maybe not an Indian audience or other audiences around the world.</p>
<p id="p-176">That makes total sense.</p>
<p id="p-177">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-178">And then you generated a thousand different title options.</p>
<p id="p-179">Yeah, I got completely lost in that.</p>
<p id="p-180">I did use, I did use some polls on LinkedIn to show different options and to get some feedback.</p>
<p id="p-181">And I mean, the problem, the problem with feedback, I mean, feedback is awesome, but you can also drown in it.</p>
<p id="p-182">In the end you have to make your own choice.</p>
<p id="p-183">Oh, you have to have a center of gravity or a gut feeling a bit of that within yourself.</p>
<p id="p-184">Right, Or, and also to understand what is your vision for this book?</p>
<p id="p-185">Because everyone has their own vision for your product.</p>
<p id="p-186">Yeah, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-187">Interesting.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-188">Yeah, Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-189">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-190">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-191">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-192">I love this.</p>
<p id="p-193">Well, I like your approach because it seems like in my mind, my bias towards writing books is that people are in their office with a, with a pot of coffee and just communicating with their editor for a year at a time.</p>
<p id="p-194">And maybe that's how some people do it.</p>
<p id="p-195">But now we have these incredible tools.</p>
<p id="p-196">We can crowdsource the creation of the book in a sense.</p>
<p id="p-197">Yeah, Yeah, So smart.</p>
<p id="p-198">What would be the third thing you're on that you did?</p>
<p id="p-199">Yeah, So I went toward the end, uh, actually toward the end when, when the first conversion was complete of the manuscript.</p>
<p id="p-200">And then I get, got onto Readsie, which is a platform that allows you to hire freelancers that are really, that are helpful for, for book product, for book production.</p>
<p id="p-201">Oh, interesting.</p>
<p id="p-202">Um, and, um, uh, I, I found a professional editor.</p>
<p id="p-203">Um, however, um, when you find, you know, there's thousands of professional editors out there and I was really looking for one per one that was, um, I think in the end she was U S native.</p>
<p id="p-204">She was born in the U S she lived in the UK.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-205">born in the US, she lived in the UK, but did a lot of editing for international audiences.</p>
<p id="p-206">That was so important because she wouldn't add any, you know, pop references or film references that in other places people don't know about.</p>
<p id="p-207">And she was really good at spotting some of those things, so that was helpful.</p>
<p id="p-208">Yeah, that is so important.</p>
<p id="p-209">Who you hire to be on your team, it really matters and their perspective, how open are they?</p>
<p id="p-210">What are their blind spots?</p>
<p id="p-211">That's one thing I've become more and more aware of, blind spots, and do people recognize their blind spots the second time or the third time they come up?</p>
<p id="p-212">So important.</p>
<p id="p-213">I love this.</p>
<p id="p-214">I love this.</p>
<p id="p-215">So just to summarize, did you want to say something else, Irian?</p>
<p id="p-216">Yeah, I wanted to add, like, what was surprising to me, that was the first time I learned that that's actually the process, is that she made a style guide.</p>
<p id="p-217">So, of course, I had to tell her, do we use British spelling or American spelling?</p>
<p id="p-218">But even further, it's like, when she was working on the first few chapters, she figured out how I like to do it.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-219">few chapters, she figured out how I like to phrase things.</p>
<p id="p-220">And sometimes she wanted to change something and I pushed back and said, actually, no, I'd love to say it in this way.</p>
<p id="p-221">And she created a style guide for herself, which then helped us, you know, get the whole book through.</p>
<p id="p-222">That is so smart.</p>
<p id="p-223">So she was process oriented, right?</p>
<p id="p-224">Yeah, And I think what I learned from that is that there's no one right, correct way to write English.</p>
<p id="p-225">Like there's their styles.</p>
<p id="p-226">And yeah, I didn't know that.</p>
<p id="p-227">So it was interesting.</p>
<p id="p-228">So what did you go with in terms of spelling conventions?</p>
<p id="p-229">Did you do UK, US or a blend, create your own kind of blend of the spelling?</p>
<p id="p-230">For me, a blend wouldn't work.</p>
<p id="p-231">I think, I mean, even the word, even like the word organization, you cannot spell it with an S or a Z across the book.</p>
<p id="p-232">Right, But yeah.</p>
<p id="p-233">So we went for US based spelling and that's because that's my, I wouldn't say, yeah, that's, that's how I write.</p>
<p id="p-234">Funny enough.</p>
<p id="p-235">But then she, she had some things in there about, about things being sometimes informal.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-236">things being sometimes informal.</p>
<p id="p-237">It's also about quotation marks, like where to put them.</p>
<p id="p-238">Yeah, Because there's choices there.</p>
<p id="p-239">I didn't know that it existed.</p>
<p id="p-240">Like when you use Grammarly, it will tell you there's one right way, you know, it will correct it.</p>
<p id="p-241">But you can have variations, like do you put the dot inside or outside of the quotation marks?</p>
<p id="p-242">Like those are some of those things.</p>
<p id="p-243">Yeah, Do you know if when you install Grammarly, I'm curious, I don't know, can you choose UK English or US English?</p>
<p id="p-244">Do you know if that's an option?</p>
<p id="p-245">You can.</p>
<p id="p-246">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-247">Okay, perfect.</p>
<p id="p-248">But I'm not sure there's many other options than that.</p>
<p id="p-249">It's pretty binary.</p>
<p id="p-250">Yeah, Got it.</p>
<p id="p-251">Okay, this is good.</p>
<p id="p-252">I feel like I've learned a lot.</p>
<p id="p-253">And I really think that our listeners, again, for our listeners, I'll speak directly to our listeners now, everyone, if you have a dream of writing a book, or writing something, maybe it's a murder mystery novel, you know, think about writing it in English, because the journey would make you a better speaker in the end.</p>
<p id="p-254">And it's just a journey that where you could push yourself to grow as a person, you're on any final pieces of advice or words of wisdom when it comes to writing.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-255">or words of wisdom when it comes to writing in English for our listeners?</p>
<p id="p-256">Yeah, I would say with the tools that are available these days, don't let it hold you back.</p>
<p id="p-257">Yeah, You know, it's really not that hard anymore.</p>
<p id="p-258">You can always still write drafts in your own language and then throw it through ChatGPT to get it translated.</p>
<p id="p-259">Yeah, But in the end, writing in English does have a lot of advantages.</p>
<p id="p-260">And as a final advice, do get professional help before you publish, which is the editor part.</p>
<p id="p-261">Yes, 100%, so resourceful.</p>
<p id="p-262">I love this.</p>
<p id="p-263">Urien, where can our listeners find you online if they want to reach out to you or would like to learn more, maybe see your book, take a look at your book?</p>
<p id="p-264">Yeah, so my book is at www.unblockbook.net.</p>
