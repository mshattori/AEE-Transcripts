<p>Hey, Aubrey, a quick update.</p>
<p>So I am flying to Boston next Friday morning.</p>
<p>So we need to record on a different day.</p>
<p>We normally record on Fridays but can't do it.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>When are you thinking? Oh, I wonder if our listeners, our listeners just had an inside look into our typical conversations.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Scheduling recording.</p>
<p>And this is interesting because I didn't say, when do you think, when are you thinking? Which might have sounded strange to some of you or you might have been thinking like, yes, why do native speakers say that? I don't understand? That's not what I learned.</p>
<p>Yes, I'm so excited in this series.</p>
<p>We're letting our listeners in on a little secret, right? That some of these stated verbs can actually be used in the I N G form.</p>
<p>So cool, so quickly.</p>
<p>And in part one of the series, we answered a question specifically about like love these state of verbs of emotion.</p>
<p>So don't miss that if you missed it, scroll up.</p>

<p>Be sure to hit follow so that you don't miss this awesome series.</p>
<p>This part two of a three part series.</p>
<p>Lovely.</p>
<p>Hit that follow button guys.</p>
<p>I'm going to read the question from our listener.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don't have the listener's name, but we appreciate any and all questions, especially specific questions, right? Aubrey.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So send them to support at all E English dot com.</p>
<p>We'll make sure it gets to our, to our team, to you Aubrey to Michelle to plan these episodes and we will feature your question on the show.</p>
<p>All right, here we go.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So the grammar question which I understand but can't explain is the use of state of verbs.</p>
<p>For example, want understand in the present continuous tense.</p>
<p>We non native speakers have always been taught that those kinds of verbs are normally not used in the progressive tenses.</p>
<p>Has this rule been changed? If so is that for spoken English only? And generally, is it because the language is always evolving right off the bat? What do you think, Aubrey, what's your, I love this question and you have really hit the nail on the head.</p>
<p>Whoever this listener is, who sent it in both of those are accurate.</p>
<p>It's really more for spoken English and yes, because language evolves and it's like trendy, right? To do this.</p>
<p>And I think that once upon a time, many years ago, it wasn't the case.</p>
<p>It's so fun because I watched the show, ghosts, I've told you about this show.</p>
<p>You really should check it out.</p>
<p>It's such a cute show and it's so well done.</p>
<p>Um because they take uh all these ghosts that died on this upstate New York Mansion property all the way back to like the 15 hundreds.</p>
<p>You have people from the roaring twenties, one person from the roaring twenties, one person from the revolutionary times and they all speak differently.</p>
<p>That's the part that I find the most interesting.</p>
<p>And you know, people say, wouldn't say, when are you thinking chocolate cake? Honestly, like even the guy from the nineties, there's this guy, Pete, this character from the nineties and he's so nineties.</p>
<p>Oh my God, he's great.</p>
<p>He wouldn't.</p>
<p>I've even said that.</p>
<p>So it's new.</p>
<p>Yes, it's evolving.</p>
<p>It's trendy.</p>
<p>But we do, we do it a lot.</p>
<p>You guys are hearing it a lot and we get a lot of questions about this.</p>
<p>So I'm excited.</p>
<p>We're doing this series to clarify for you guys when you can do it because some state of verbs we do this with but some you really can't.</p>
<p>So we dove into emotions like like and love in that first part.</p>
<p>Today, we are talking about these other kinds of verbs, thoughts and opinions, state of verbs.</p>
<p>Sometimes we can do this and sometimes we can't.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we have a category of two buckets today of the ones that you can actually put them into the progressive as well as, as just the present form.</p>
<p>And then we have a bucket where you cannot, where we do not do this.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And these are just the most common state of verbs.</p>
<p>This is certainly not an exhaustive list.</p>
<p>There are a bunch, but these are the ones that are going to come up really often in conversations for you.</p>
<p>OK? Cool.</p>
<p>So let's go through uh what, what are the ones that in the bucket of? You can actually go ahead and experiment in the present continuous tense.</p>
<p>So first think, right, we definitely say like I think so.</p>
<p>I think this, but then we also will say, oh I'm thinking we made a mistake and we're making it more of a momentary action that I'm currently thinking this maybe next week I'll change my mind.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And again, I want to reemphasize the first part of the question from the listener.</p>
<p>Is it for spoken English only? Yes, I wouldn't really, if you know, if I were writing some kind of report, I wouldn't really because this is articulating thoughts live in the moment I would rework my thought.</p>
<p>Um I think we must made a mistake.</p>
<p>I believe we made a mistake.</p>
<p>Right, Right, And so for informal texts or emails, we write like we speak.</p>
<p>So you might see this.</p>
<p>But for formal writing, just like you said, Lindsay, we would say we wouldn't say this.</p>
<p>It's very much spoken English.</p>
<p>Yeah, totally.</p>
<p>And then agree.</p>
<p>OK, this one.</p>
<p>So I'm agreeing with you.</p>
<p>Don't worry, stop freaking out.</p>
<p>I'm agreeing with you.</p>
<p>Right, I'm actually this is very specific, right? Usually we would just say, I agree with you in general.</p>
<p>We're talking about our state of mind.</p>
<p>But if you are in the moment having a conversation and someone says, you're not listening to my side and you say I'm agreeing with you, you're not listening to me.</p>
<p>You're talking about right now in this moment.</p>
<p>Listen to me what I'm saying.</p>
<p>I'm agreeing with you.</p>
<p>Right, Totally.</p>
<p>And then doubt, I'm doubting myself.</p>
<p>Right, Or I doubt that, um, in general, like you doubt something in general.</p>
<p>But right now in this moment I might say, oh, I'm doubting myself, you guys will say on a regular basis, I doubt myself.</p>
<p>Right, Yes, Absolutely.</p>
<p>Right, Both work.</p>
<p>It all depends on the context and the time.</p>
<p>So it's all about like, is this a momentary thought, a momentary action? I'm turning it into an action verb or is it a state verb is at a state of mind? Guessing? I'm guessing he won't like this.</p>
<p>Very common to hear that.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And of course, we say, I guess not.</p>
<p>You know, we'll also use this as a state of verb in which case present simple when we are talking about this momentary action.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>This is so common.</p>
<p>I do this all the time.</p>
<p>I'm guessing he'll be late.</p>
<p>I'm guessing we shouldn't do this.</p>
<p>And it's because I'm talking about my state of mind right now in this moment.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's a really good one.</p>
<p>Really puts you into people into your mind.</p>
<p>Right? Really? It is kind of a connection phrase.</p>
<p>I'm guessing this will happen because yeah, people you're talking to a slice of your mind.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Yes, And there are more like, imagine, remember we might say, I'm remembering that last week.</p>
<p>I da da da da.</p>
<p>It's there are more, but these are the most common if you have to pick a few to start using and progressive to sound more native today.</p>
<p>These are the ones you want to choose.</p>
<p>All right, cool.</p>
<p>Now we're going to take a break and then we'll come back to the ones that we cannot change into I N G.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yes, OK, We are back.</p>
<p>So Aubrey believe would be our first one.</p>
<p>That can we say believing? We don't, right? We say I believe you.</p>
<p>I believe this because we're talking about a belief.</p>
<p>That's not something we talk about as being true in a moment.</p>
<p>We don't give it time.</p>
<p>I would never say like I'm believing you, I'm believing it.</p>
<p>This is, we don't say it that way.</p>
<p>What about preferences? What can we do there? Same thing for all of these don't use them.</p>
<p>We don't recommend using them in present progressive.</p>
<p>You're going to say like I prefer oatmeal raisin cookies.</p>
<p>We would not say I'm preferring this because it's such a, this is just like a solid state of verb that you can't turn into an action.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the other episode we talked about, oh, I'm really liking these new restaurants cropping up in Denver, right? But I wouldn't say it seems like you should be able to say I'm really preferring these new restaurants cropping up in Denver, but you can't.</p>
<p>So it doesn't follow the same logic of the to pull in a pro tip from part one.</p>
<p>Make sure to go listen to it guys.</p>
<p>It's a lot about how much passion is there and prefer is so neutral.</p>
<p>I prefer this type of cookies.</p>
<p>I'm loving chocolate chip cookies though.</p>
<p>That was kind of our takeaway from that episode was what's the, what's the temperature level of what you're saying? Their emotion is, our passion is definitely a very muted verb.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So don't say I'm preferring just, I prefer all of these.</p>
<p>Don't say I'm believing I'm preferring nope, right? And then I know that uh we don't say we never say because same as believe it's sort of the same meaning.</p>
<p>I know this or I don't, I'm not going to say I'm knowing this right now.</p>
<p>No, no, it doesn't work.</p>
<p>Um Mean, I mean it or she means what she says, never say.</p>
<p>She's meaning what she's saying.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And this is the first one that's really tricky because that word meaning does exist, but it's a noun, right? The meaning of the sentence is blank.</p>
<p>That is not at all related to the verb means.</p>
<p>So don't let yourself get confused if you see the word meaning that is not a state of verb being used at the I N G.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, English is tricky and these words also exist in other forms and we're going to see that one more time right now.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>What is that? Where do we have to be careful, also, understand, we only say I understand, right.</p>
<p>This, this understand, you know, the, uh when we talk about these being thoughts and opinions, right? This is my thought that I understand and we wouldn't say I'm understanding you like, I mean, I understand but that word does exist.</p>
<p>Right, Lindsay understanding.</p>
<p>Yeah, we have an understanding, right? Or I'm very understanding.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>We have the noun.</p>
<p>Yeah, we have this understanding.</p>
<p>It's a thing.</p>
<p>And then we also have the adjective, I'm an understanding person.</p>
<p>So because that word exists as an adjective and a noun, you might be confused and try to use it as a state of verb I N G, we don't say it that way.</p>
<p>If you want to tell someone, you understand where they're coming from, just say I understand, I understand where you're coming from.</p>
<p>That could be another great episode for our listeners.</p>
<p>Aubry the ones that exist as I N G because there's so much or roots that exist in verb form, noun form, adjective form.</p>
<p>And how do we parse out the differences using context? It can, I mean, even native speakers can sometimes get confused with some of them, I think.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And we have done some episodes that are related where adjectives and nouns like how do we use them? Be? Sure you're hitting follow because I agree, Lindsay, I think we should dive into that again in the future.</p>
<p>OK, Let's put it into life here.</p>
<p>We've been doing a lot of definitions.</p>
<p>Examples.</p>
<p>Let's put it into a role play.</p>
<p>We are eating at a restaurant.</p>
<p>Love that all start us out.</p>
<p>So this place seems amazing.</p>
<p>I'm thinking I want to taste everything on this menu.</p>
<p>It does all look delicious.</p>
<p>Well, I usually prefer the place in midtown, but I'm excited to try something new.</p>
<p>I'm guessing we couldn't get in there though.</p>
<p>I doubt we could get a reservation.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>OK, Yes, So I'm thinking I want to taste everything on the menu.</p>
<p>Very common.</p>
<p>Very trendy.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And both would work here.</p>
<p>You could say, I think I want to taste everything on the menu.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Exact same meaning.</p>
<p>But because you can also make it this momentary action more in the moment you can say this.</p>
<p>I'm thinking I want to taste everything on this menu.</p>
<p>It might sound grammatically incorrect to you guys out there listening.</p>
<p>You found out in textbooks.</p>
<p>Teachers told you not to do that.</p>
<p>We do it.</p>
<p>Language is evolving.</p>
<p>It's casual English.</p>
<p>It's not a grammar error, right? That's just the way we speak.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you sit down, I had to have dinner with anyone and you got handed the menu.</p>
<p>The first thing that your dining partner is going to look across the table and say, hm, what are you thinking? What are you thinking? That's such a good point.</p>
<p>We don't say, what do you think? It's about what I, what are you thinking? Which means, what do you think you're going to order? I would say, what do you think if it's more like a big life decision that's going beyond just this moment? Looking at this menu? Hey, what do you think I should do about this problem? Right, That's different.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>Whereas what are you thinking? It's very much about this moment.</p>
<p>You're looking at the menu.</p>
<p>What do you think you'll order? What do you think? Yeah.</p>
<p>But so common, incredibly common.</p>
<p>And to think that this isn't really being taught around the world in textbooks from what we gather from our listeners.</p>
<p>There's big gaps missing guys.</p>
<p>That's why I went to prepare this.</p>
<p>We've gotten all of these questions from um students and I did a little Google search and there's not much out there because I think this is one of those gray areas where some of the grammar, some of the grammar websites are like, we can't teach this because textbooks often say it's incorrect.</p>
<p>So you'll see it in forums and be like, oh yeah, we say it this way, but it can be confusing when you're trying to learn from forums because there will be people disagreeing with each other.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We like to hang out in the gray areas of English, don't we? Absolutely.</p>
<p>That's what we come here.</p>
<p>We will share.</p>
<p>This is how we talk and this is how you can talk to because our value is higher than the linguistic guide or the dictionary.</p>
<p>It's about connection and whether you're saying it correctly or incorrectly or in the gray area, you can connect and that should be the goal.</p>
<p>So just to make sure these will make you sound like a native, native English speakers are not going to hear this and think it's a mistake, they're going to hear this and think you sound, you're speaking the way they speak.</p>
<p>It sounds very natural and there's more connection there.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So finishing up here, I usually prefer the place in midtown, but I'm excited to try something new.</p>
<p>In that case.</p>
<p>We never go into I N G with that one.</p>
<p>You would never say I'm preferring the place in midtown these days.</p>
<p>It just sounds strange.</p>
<p>Right, I usually prefer to you.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>When I said, I'm guessing we couldn't get in there though.</p>
<p>And this really, I'm guessing is very common.</p>
<p>I wouldn't say, I guess we couldn't get in there.</p>
<p>That's a different meaning.</p>
<p>I could say I'm thinking we couldn't get in there though.</p>
<p>These have the same meaning of like right now in this moment.</p>
<p>This is what I'm thinking.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And you have an opportunity to use a little intonation here too with, I'm guessing I'm guessing.</p>
<p>Right, I'm guessing we couldn't get in there though.</p>
<p>You're kind of putting forth a point of view and it's just an assumption like a guess.</p>
<p>But this is the way we say it to almost, like, soften it to be like, I don't know for sure.</p>
<p>But I'm guessing this.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's a bit of softening going on.</p>
<p>And then you said at the end, I doubt we could get a reservation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Those midtown restaurants hard to get a reservation.</p>
<p>But these days I wonder if that's changing with so many people working from home at lunch time.</p>
<p>I wonder if it's easier to eat at the fancy places in midtown.</p>
<p>I don't know, as far as New York, but in Arizona it's hard to get a reservation these days and a lot of places aren't taking reservations.</p>
<p>You just have to go and wait an hour if you want to go do that now.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's true.</p>
<p>And everyone has to be there before you actually put your name in.</p>
<p>Have you seen that? We see that a lot? It's so hard.</p>
<p>It's hard work for us.</p>
<p>We want to be able to show up and eat.</p>
<p>I know, I think it's good to point out.</p>
<p>You could say either here.</p>
<p>Right, I could have said I'm doubting we could get a reservation or I doubt we could get a reservation.</p>
<p>These really are interchangeable in that context.</p>
<p>Yes, Love it.</p>
<p>What's a takeaway? I think we said it a little bit earlier is we're hanging out in a gray area here guys and, you know, we're not linguists.</p>
<p>Uh, our value is connection.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>We want you guys to be able to connect and state of verbs are such a great way to connect because often these are about what you're feeling, what you're thinking and you want to be able to share that with those in English that you're speaking to in order to deepen your connections.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It's such an opportunity.</p>
<p>Anytime you're sharing something from your own mind and heart, it's such an opportunity and bringing people in with the I N G just brings it to life.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yes, I love it.</p>
<p>I'm excited for you guys to have these tips to know which verbs, which state of verbs you can do this with and which you should avoid so that you can deepen those connections.</p>
<p>All right, good stuff, Aubrey.</p>
<p>I'll see you back here very soon.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Thanks Lindsay.</p>
