<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p>find out what this phrase means and how native speakers use it to express that they are understanding nuances in English.</p>
<p>Hello, Lindsay.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>Hey there, Michelle.</p>
<p>I'm doing great.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>I'm good.</p>
<p>I'm good.</p>
<p>Lindsay, do you tend to get lost a lot?</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Do I get lost a lot?</p>
<p>Yes, In a new place, yes.</p>
<p>Thank goodness for Google Maps.</p>
<p>I have no internal GPS.</p>
<p>If I go to a strange city, let's say I go visit Detroit or something and I don't know the city, I cannot remember.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm not good at that.</p>
<p>I'm the same.</p>
<p>I am very, very thankful that we live in the time with Google Maps.</p>
<p>I really don't know where I would be.</p>
<p>How did people do it?</p>
<p>I think people just talk to each other more often, I guess.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>Stopped at the gas station to ask for directions.</p>
<p>Right, Yeah, it's true.</p>
<p>What does that have to do with today's episode?</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>Does it have to do with today's episode?</p>
<p>Well, the word lost is in the expression that we're going to be talking about today.</p>
<p>We're not actually really talking about being lost direction-wise, but we are going to get into something interesting with the word lost.</p>
<p>And this is based on a really good listener question from YouTube.</p>
<p>Ooh, we love good listener questions.</p>
<p>Guys, don't forget, we have a whole YouTube channel where you can find this episode today and other episodes recorded on video.</p>
<p>So go over to YouTube and type in All Ears English and hit subscribe.</p>
<p>All right, Michelle, should I go ahead and read the listener question?</p>
<p>Sure, please.</p>
<p>All right, this is from AdBlue1Blue.</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Sajjad.</p>
<p>I'm from Iran.</p>
<p>First of all, I want to say thank you guys for your amazing podcast, and I have a question.</p>
<p>What does not lost on me at all mean?</p>
<p>I heard it from How I Met Your Mother.</p>
<p>Keep up the nice work.</p>
<p>Michelle, do you watch that show, How I Met Your Mother?</p>
<p>I did watch it.</p>
<p>Yeah, how about you?</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>watch it.</p>
<p>Yeah, how about you?</p>
<p>I never really got into it, but it's always on TV now.</p>
<p>I always see it on TV, so sometimes I'll just catch like a rerun or something.</p>
<p>I never watch it now, but I did watch it like towards the end of when the show was on.</p>
<p>So yeah, I know it, but it's not it's not a show I'm an expert on.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>This did you hear this expression recently?</p>
<p>Yes, I actually heard it just this past weekend.</p>
<p>So I know I love it when I plan an episode and or I'm about to plan an episode and I think, oh, I just heard that.</p>
<p>And that's how I know that that's a really good question.</p>
<p>It's how we know we're teaching real English right here on this show.</p>
<p>Guys, go ahead and hit the follow button for that exact reason, because we teach you real English.</p>
<p>We don't really go back and change these conversations, by the way.</p>
<p>A lot of podcasts do edit out things.</p>
<p>We don't really edit.</p>
<p>We have a wonderful editor.</p>
<p>Gaspar is amazing.</p>
<p>Shout out to Gaspar.</p>
<p>Thank you, Gaspar.</p>
<p>Yeah,</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>Thank you, Gaspar.</p>
<p>But we don't change the little utterances that we make.</p>
<p>We don't go back and change our mistakes because we want to show you real English.</p>
<p>And that is one reason that All Ears English is different from other podcasts and one reason to hit that follow button.</p>
<p>Right, Michelle?</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>Make sure you hit follow wherever you're listening to All Ears English so you never miss an episode.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Okay, so Michelle, let's just make sure we're super clear for our listeners.</p>
<p>What is the expression we're talking about today?</p>
<p>Okay, so something is not lost on someone.</p>
<p>And then this listener added at all, which we can touch on, but we're really going to mostly just talk on something is not lost on someone.</p>
<p>So if you say not lost on you, okay, something is not lost on you, that means you understand or appreciate something in some way.</p>
<p>So you recognize something.</p>
<p>Now, that sounds maybe a little confusing, so let's do</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>may be a little confusing, so let's do some examples.</p>
<p>Lindsay, do you want to do the first one?</p>
<p>Yeah, here we go.</p>
<p>It's not lost on me how lucky I am to have my job.</p>
<p>I know others have not had as much luck, right?</p>
<p>And we often realize this when we go into a recession, for example, if people lose their jobs and we still have our job, we feel very grateful, right?</p>
<p>It's not lost on me.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Right, So you can appreciate it.</p>
<p>You recognize it.</p>
<p>It doesn't just go over your head.</p>
<p>You see it.</p>
<p>Or here's another one.</p>
<p>His comments were not lost on me.</p>
<p>I knew exactly what he was implying.</p>
<p>Ooh, yes.</p>
<p>Sounds like there was... I love this phrase because it really gets at the fact that a lot of communication is not necessarily in the exact words, literally, of what we're trying to say.</p>
<p>It's the undercurrent.</p>
<p>It's the implications.</p>
<p>It's the analogies that we use.</p>
<p>It's the tone of voice, Michelle.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>There's so much more than the actual...</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>There's so much more than the actual word.</p>
<p>So I knew exactly what he was implying.</p>
<p>So maybe he was saying something fine, but you knew what it was really about.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love that now our listeners are going to have a way to articulate this.</p>
<p>Here's another one.</p>
<p>Her kindness is not lost on me.</p>
<p>I do not take it for granted.</p>
<p>So this one is not as much about, you know, underhanded, like other ways of saying things.</p>
<p>Someone is being kind, but we're saying we actually noticed that.</p>
<p>Life can get really busy and we can take people for granted, right?</p>
<p>Right, right, exactly.</p>
<p>So I was thinking of an example from my life and I could say, it's not lost on me how lucky I am to have lived in New York.</p>
<p>So I appreciate it.</p>
<p>I notice it.</p>
<p>I'm aware of it.</p>
<p>It doesn't just go over my head.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, that's perfect.</p>
<p>I love that, Michelle.</p>
<p>Yeah, you are lucky to have lived in New York too.</p>
<p>Yeah, Do you have anything that you feel like is not lost on you?</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>Like it's not lost on you?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think for me it's not lost on me how great my upbringing was, my childhood.</p>
<p>My parents were amazing.</p>
<p>I was a happy kid.</p>
<p>I feel like I was able to do a lot of things as a kid and I feel grateful for it.</p>
<p>Great example.</p>
<p>So this is also another way to express gratitude for things in our life.</p>
<p>Isn't it, Michelle?</p>
<p>Yep, exactly.</p>
<p>はじめての世界がすぐそこに。アメリカン航空とJALのパートナーシップがあなたの旅にもっと自由と快適さをお届けます。日本からロサンゼルス、ニューヨーク、ダラス、シカゴなどアメリカ主要都市直行便。さらに中南米各地もスムーズにアクセス。つながる翼、広がる空の旅。アメリカン航空とJALで世界がもっと近くなる。Alright, so speaking of gratitude, what are some ways that we use this?</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>There's some ways that we use this.</p>
<p>Why would we use this, Michelle?</p>
<p>Right, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Like Lindsay just said, when we're thankful for something, we're grateful.</p>
<p>It's not lost on me how great my upbringing was.</p>
<p>It's not lost on me how lucky I am for XYZ.</p>
<p>And another thing that I just like about that is it shows that we're paying attention.</p>
<p>It sounds smart.</p>
<p>It sounds like we are aware of what's going on.</p>
<p>We're with it.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So it's, I think, also very important today because as Lindsay was mentioning, everything is kind of go, go, go and busy.</p>
<p>But if you say, oh, something isn't lost on me, you're saying, yeah, maybe things are busy, but I know this to be.</p>
<p>Yes, you've taken the time to observe and to understand that something's going on, and you need a way to say that.</p>
<p>And this is perfect for that.</p>
<p>Yes, right.</p>
<p>Or when we understand that something is important or difficult, right?</p>
<p>Maybe you're having a conversation with...</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>Or maybe you're having a conversation with a friend and you need a way to show that you really understand what they're going through, okay?</p>
<p>This could be useful in that case.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it could also be used at work or in your personal life.</p>
<p>So what about adding at all?</p>
<p>And we could do a whole episode on that, but our listener was asking about something is not lost on me at all.</p>
<p>This is just a way of, I think it's just intensifying it a little bit, in no way, right?</p>
<p>So you can do that.</p>
<p>That would be fine too.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think he was just quoting the movie line and we actually, Michelle, have we done an episode on adding at all?</p>
<p>I don't think so.</p>
<p>And I think we should.</p>
<p>That's insane.</p>
<p>I can't believe it.</p>
<p>We need to do that episode.</p>
<p>Guys, hit the follow button so you don't miss that episode coming up soon.</p>
<p>We'll cover that in another episode.</p>
<p>All right, but basically what Michelle said is perfect.</p>
<p>It's intensifying what you're saying, okay?</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>what you're saying, okay?</p>
<p>So do we ever say something is lost on us, right?</p>
<p>We are talking about, oh, it's not lost on me.</p>
<p>Do we ever say, oh, that's lost on me?</p>
<p>It's a great question.</p>
<p>I don't think we do.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>I mean, I guess you could say something like, oh, her explanation was lost on me, right?</p>
<p>You could, but it's not very common.</p>
<p>It's not really, I would say this is very common in the negative, less so in the positive.</p>
<p>Yeah, there are other things that you might say if you're looking for the positive.</p>
<p>Like, for example, completely went over her head.</p>
<p>Right, Or she missed the cues, things like that.</p>
<p>So yeah, grammatically you could say it was completely lost on me, but it's just not used as much.</p>
<p>Yeah, yep, exactly.</p>
<p>So, but what are some things that you could say that are a little bit similar?</p>
<p>Yeah, you could say it does or it did not go unnoticed.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>did not go unnoticed?</p>
<p>Something didn't go unnoticed?</p>
<p>His generosity did not go unnoticed.</p>
<p>He got an extra large tip.</p>
<p>Or just appreciate.</p>
<p>I appreciate his words, but his actions don't seem to match.</p>
<p>I like the word appreciate.</p>
<p>It means so many things, right?</p>
<p>It's like you see that it means to see something, to value something.</p>
<p>It's kind of a multi-layered word in a way.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is.</p>
<p>So yeah, I just think that this is really good for connection, this whole idea.</p>
<p>Again, we talked about just showing you're paying attention.</p>
<p>You're not letting things just slide.</p>
<p>You're actually actively paying attention to what's going on in your life or you're thankful for something.</p>
<p>Yes, and you need to be able to express that, right?</p>
<p>Because again, people have different communication styles.</p>
<p>And in different cultures, people say things differently.</p>
<p>Sometimes</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>say things differently.</p>
<p>Sometimes things are said more through eye contact or through body language rather than the words.</p>
<p>We're a culture where the message is really often in the words themselves, but that's not true around the world.</p>
<p>There's so many nuances involved with connection, Michelle.</p>
<p>Yeah, good point.</p>
<p>Let's put it together in a role play.</p>
<p>So here we are friends, and I'm complaining to Lindsay about my boyfriend, but also I'm making excuses.</p>
<p>Oh, complicated situation.</p>
<p>Okay, here we go.</p>
<p>Very complicated.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>He could be nicer, but I really do like him.</p>
<p>Michelle, he's no good.</p>
<p>Believe me, Lindsay, it's not lost on me that he's not perfect, but he has a lot of good qualities.</p>
<p>I appreciate the fact that he was really nice to me when I lost my phone, but his flakiness towards you does not go unnoticed.</p>
<p>Maybe you're right.</p>
<p>And this is the number one job of a friend, isn't it?</p>
<p>Yes,</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>a friend, isn't it?</p>
<p>Yes, it's a tough love.</p>
<p>Tough love, help people not fall into their blind spots when it comes to love and romance especially, right?</p>
<p>We've all got them.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>So what did you say first to me, Michelle?</p>
<p>I said, believe me, it's not lost on me that he's not perfect.</p>
<p>Now that's a little complicated.</p>
<p>Yeah, double negative here.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's not lost on me.</p>
<p>So I'm aware that he's not perfect.</p>
<p>So I'm aware that he's not perfect, but he has good qualities.</p>
<p>So I'm trying to make excuses for him.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>And then I said, I appreciate the fact that he was nice to me when I lost my phone.</p>
<p>So I'm giving him that.</p>
<p>I'm saying, I appreciate something, I saw something, I noticed something, right?</p>
<p>But his flakiness towards you does not go unnoticed.</p>
<p>Okay, so that's interesting because we're speaking in the passive voice there.</p>
<p>Yeah, Right, so who, it doesn't, right, exactly, it is passive.</p>
<p>So who does it?</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>So who does it not go unnoticed by?</p>
<p>Yeah, so by me, right?</p>
<p>I'm saying I do not miss, I do not not notice.</p>
<p>I do not not notice.</p>
<p>It's ridiculous.</p>
<p>And sometimes we do do that double negative, which could be another great episode, Michelle.</p>
<p>Double negatives, yeah.</p>
<p>I don't not notice.</p>
<p>So we won't teach that one today, but there is something to show our listeners there for another day.</p>
<p>But yeah, so basically I'm saying I do notice it, okay?</p>
<p>Definitely, definitely.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, this was really fun.</p>
<p>And again, this was such a good question.</p>
<p>Very good to be paying attention.</p>
<p>Definitely if you're watching TV, you hear something and you're like, what is that?</p>
<p>Yes, This to us.</p>
<p>Yes, we love that.</p>
<p>We love that.</p>
<p>Send in the line or whatever it is, and we'll answer your question and we'll shout out your name on the show.</p>
<p>All right?</p>
<p>There's another episode, Michelle, where our listeners might want to go.</p>
<p>Shall I let them know?</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Shall I let them know?</p>
<p>Please let them know.</p>
<p>All right, it's 2366.</p>
<p>Just scroll back to 2366.</p>
<p>Don't blow off this English vocabulary episode.</p>
<p>Good stuff.</p>
<p>All right, takeaway for today.</p>
<p>I would say show people you're listening.</p>
<p>Show people you're paying attention by using this expression.</p>
<p>It's going to kind of elevate you and show that you're smart, you're with it, you're looking for other cues other than things that people just say and that are just easy and direct.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And as a language learning goal for our listeners at the B2, C1, C2 level, setting a goal to catch more nuances in the words that people use, right?</p>
<p>Because sometimes people select words that might have double meanings.</p>
<p>They're trying to say something, right?</p>
<p>There's so much nuance behind the language.</p>
<p>And once we get into the C levels, C1, C2, we can start to catch those.</p>
<p>So that's where we're all headed.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>So that's where we're all headed as we're listening to this podcast, right?</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, thank you again for this question.</p>
<p>And guys, give it a try.</p>
<p>Give it a try.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
