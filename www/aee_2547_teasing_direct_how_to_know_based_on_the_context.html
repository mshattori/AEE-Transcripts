<p id="p-15">Hey, Lindsay, I ate four bagels yesterday.</p>
<p id="p-16">Oh, wow, Michelle, you've reached a new low.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-17">Just kidding.</p>
<p id="p-18">I didn't eat four bagels, but like sometimes I would like to.</p>
<p id="p-19">I know, I know you're a fan of bagels.</p>
<p id="p-20">People love bagels.</p>
<p id="p-21">I'm kind of neutral about bagels.</p>
<p id="p-22">I just sometimes for me, I'd rather have a donut.</p>
<p id="p-23">You're not putting the right stuff on it.</p>
<p id="p-24">What are you doing?</p>
<p id="p-25">Yeah, what should I put on my bagel?</p>
<p id="p-26">Like what, what would be the best?</p>
<p id="p-27">Oh, well, you gotta do, well, I like, like, okay, and I like an everything bagel, and I like it, oh my gosh, have you ever had, uh, like, have you ever had whitefish?</p>
<p id="p-28">Oh, that's such a famous, yeah, I think that's, it's pretty famous in New York, right?</p>
<p id="p-29">The whitefish.</p>
<p id="p-30">Whitefish salad with lox on top, like tomato, onion, oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-31">When I, when I go to New York, I'll get um like a lox, uh like just lox, a bagel with lox and uh cream cheese.</p>
<p id="p-32">Yeah, that is so, that's really good, but it's not so much for the bagel.</p>
<p id="p-33">Like it could be on a piece of bread.</p>
<p id="p-34">I know I should never say that in front of you.</p>
<p id="p-35">Yeah,</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-36">You like that?</p>
<p id="p-37">Yeah, It's more the salmon and the cream cheese together.</p>
<p id="p-38">But anyways, bagels are famous in New York.</p>
<p id="p-39">People love them.</p>
<p id="p-40">So if you guys are in New York, get yourself a New York bagel.</p>
<p id="p-41">Right, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-42">That's right.</p>
<p id="p-43">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-44">So why did you say you've reached a new low?</p>
<p id="p-45">Well, I'm sort of being a little bit sarcastic here because I know that you love bagels, and I've heard about them a lot.</p>
<p id="p-46">But then you're saying yesterday you ate four of them, which is a lot of food, right?</p>
<p id="p-47">They're giants.</p>
<p id="p-48">I mean, especially the New York ones, they are giants.</p>
<p id="p-49">They really are.</p>
<p id="p-50">They're very blown up, right?</p>
<p id="p-51">And so I'm kind of saying you went really far with your addiction to bagels, a little too far.</p>
<p id="p-52">Yes, exactly, because if so, I can't imagine anybody going through four of them.</p>
<p id="p-53">So that's just a lot to eat.</p>
<p id="p-54">So yeah, I mean, this is an expression about actually being worse than before.</p>
<p id="p-55">So like you said, Lindsay, it can be humorous.</p>
<p id="p-56">It can also be serious depending on the context.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-57">Curious, depending on the context.</p>
<p id="p-58">So again, the expression is reach a new low.</p>
<p id="p-59">So we're going to get into that more in just a second here, but first we wanna say a huge, huge, huge thank you to our reviewers.</p>
<p id="p-60">Oh my gosh, it's all about our listeners on this show, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-61">And today I wanna announce those amazing listeners who took the time to review us in the Android app.</p>
<p id="p-62">So a huge thank you to Jisan C. Du, Myria Wurmlinger Lemes, Gabriel Spagliari, Maddy Torabi.</p>
<p id="p-63">Thank you to David Rodriguez Lorenzo and Mohona Mozafari.</p>
<p id="p-64">Most of these are five-star reviews, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-65">And it's just, it's amazing to hear from our listeners over here.</p>
<p id="p-66">Yes, Thank you so much, guys.</p>
<p id="p-67">You make our days.</p>
<p id="p-68">Really, it's so meaningful and we really appreciate it.</p>
<p id="p-69">Yeah, so wherever you're listening, whether it's in the Android, iOS app, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, take a minute now to go and leave us a rating and review.</p>
<p id="p-70">Write us a little note.</p>
<p id="p-71">Tell us what you love about the show.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-72">No, tell us what you love about the show.</p>
<p id="p-73">You could ask your episode idea, your episode question there, but send us a signal and we'd like to know what you think of the show.</p>
<p id="p-74">All right.</p>
<p id="p-75">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-76">All right.</p>
<p id="p-77">Thank you again, everyone.</p>
<p id="p-78">So let's get back into reach a new low.</p>
<p id="p-79">So OK, so this basically means, like we were saying, you've become worse than in the past.</p>
<p id="p-80">So something's happened, generally something, an event where you made me — you made that made you worse in some way.</p>
<p id="p-81">It made you worse.</p>
<p id="p-82">Yeah, Yeah, And it doesn't have to be a person, even.</p>
<p id="p-83">It could be a situation.</p>
<p id="p-84">And I thought of this episode because my kids, one of them has finished off the Halloween candy, but my son still has a bag of his, and he dropped some on the floor and started to wanna just eat it off the floor or like lick it off the floor.</p>
<p id="p-85">And even though he has more.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-86">Or, and even though he has more candy, and I said, okay, we've reached a new low.</p>
<p id="p-87">Yeah, when you're licking candy off the floor, no matter how old you are, you've reached a new low of like kind of being addicted to something in a sense, right?</p>
<p id="p-88">Yes, yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-89">So, um, you know, this was used in a humorous or teasing way, um, but what about in the role play from the beginning?</p>
<p id="p-90">Like we, again, I'd overeaten and you're teasing me about it.</p>
<p id="p-91">I'm teasing you about it.</p>
<p id="p-92">It's lighthearted, right?</p>
<p id="p-93">This is quite light and fun and sarcastic, and I'm poking fun at your addiction to bagels here, right?</p>
<p id="p-94">But, you know, you want to be careful with like that with like eating and that kind of conversation because that could be a sensitive topic.</p>
<p id="p-95">So, you know, and like if somebody, maybe somebody doesn't have a large appetite and if you don't know them that well and you're not teasing them and you say, wow, you've reached a new low, like they could get pretty offended.</p>
<p id="p-96">So I would say that, right?</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-97">Oh my gosh, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-98">Right?</p>
<p id="p-99">Um, but this is... Yeah, 100%, that's really important.</p>
<p id="p-100">Yeah, so I know that you don't have issues with eating, and so it's okay for me to tease you.</p>
<p id="p-101">I know you have an obsession with bagels and it's kind of a fun back and forth, right?</p>
<p id="p-102">But if anyone is struggling with the eating issues, I would steer clear of this, right?</p>
<p id="p-103">Because it would be taken literally, right?</p>
<p id="p-104">It would be taken seriously, not facetiously or sarcastically, right?</p>
<p id="p-105">Right, So that person might be insecure about it and they're binging eating or have some sort of disorder or whatever it is.</p>
<p id="p-106">And if you just go, wow, you've reached a new low, it's not going to be taken the same way as if Lindsay, who knows me well, who knows about the bagels, I know my son well, we're just joking around.</p>
<p id="p-107">Like, there has to be a certain level of familiarity in order to be able to use that in that context.</p>
<p id="p-108">Super important.</p>
<p id="p-109">So that's where the nuance is in today's episode.</p>
<p id="p-110">it's the same phrase, but if you use it in the wrong situation, right, it could be taken literally and directly and really harm someone, right?</p>
<p id="p-111">Really hurt someone.</p>
<p id="p-112">Whereas if...</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-113">Might really hurt someone, whereas if it's used in the right way with the right person at the right time, it's fun, it's playful, it's teasing.</p>
<p id="p-114">That's where the line to.</p>
<p id="p-115">Mm-hmm.</p>
<p id="p-116">Yeah, there's a line, a fine line.</p>
<p id="p-117">Yeah, very interesting here.</p>
<p id="p-118">Well, let's do some more examples that don't deal with bagels or candy.</p>
<p id="p-119">So the first one is, I always thought he was rude, but he reached a new low when he asked me to drive him to the airport when I had the flu.</p>
<p id="p-120">Yeah, and so this is a little more straightforward and direct.</p>
<p id="p-121">Like, you're actually saying he's a pretty bad guy, right?</p>
<p id="p-122">Like, he, we, you thought he was rude, but then it became worse, right?</p>
<p id="p-123">Yeah, or not thought, at the very least, not thoughtful, right?</p>
<p id="p-124">Yes, yes.</p>
<p id="p-125">He's not, you know, thinking about you.</p>
<p id="p-126">He's a little self-centered.</p>
<p id="p-127">Yes, Or, I can't believe we stayed up binging that show until 4 a.m. Seriously, we've reached a new low.</p>
<p id="p-128">So this is us just kind of making fun of ourselves, right?</p>
<p id="p-129">Um, we're a little addicted to Netflix or something.</p>
<p id="p-130">Yes, exactly.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-131">Yes, exactly, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-132">And I'm sure everybody can relate to that moment of, even if, it maybe it's not watching TV, but even reading.</p>
<p id="p-133">I just finished a book and I would stay up late reading it.</p>
<p id="p-134">And my friend just finished a book and she did say that she stayed up till 4 a.m. reading it because she was so addicted to it.</p>
<p id="p-135">And I can't read that book because I can't stay up till 4 a.m. I mean, I can, but like, I, Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-136">Or here's another one.</p>
<p id="p-137">This restaurant was going downhill, but their atmosphere has reached a new low.</p>
<p id="p-138">I don't think I'll be coming back.</p>
<p id="p-139">So, are we teasing the restaurant, Michelle, here?</p>
<p id="p-140">No, no, this is the more straightforward one.</p>
<p id="p-141">It's getting worse.</p>
<p id="p-142">It's getting even worse.</p>
<p id="p-143">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-144">And here's the next one.</p>
<p id="p-145">Okay, your outfits have reached a new low.</p>
<p id="p-146">This is supposed to be formal night, right?</p>
<p id="p-147">So maybe for many, many times in a row, you are showing up too casual.</p>
<p id="p-148">And again, this time you showed up really casual, but.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-149">You showed up really casual, but you were supposed to be formal, so it's reached a new low, right?</p>
<p id="p-150">Well, that reminds me of Dan because we've gone on cruises, and he kind of, they always have like a formal night on cruises, and he's decided that he's not packing a suit on a cruise.</p>
<p id="p-151">So his formal night is like a Hawaiian shirt and shorts, and it's like, no, no.</p>
<p id="p-152">Is Dan one of those guys that wears shorts in the wintertime?</p>
<p id="p-153">Because there was an article, I didn't read it, but there was a headline I saw somewhere about dudes in the US who won't wear pants, like they'll wear shorts and sandals in the winter.</p>
<p id="p-154">Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's just for like on vacation when it's warm.</p>
<p id="p-155">No, he wears pants.</p>
<p id="p-156">So, but yeah, you can see, it's used with the truth, or sarcastically, it could be self-deprecating, but again, you have to be very careful if you're teasing someone with this.</p>
<p id="p-157">If you're using it in a teasy teasing way.</p>
<p id="p-158">Yes,</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-159">Yeah, And what else is interesting, I thought, what I said to my son was, I realized this.</p>
<p id="p-160">I actually said, we've reached a new low.</p>
<p id="p-161">I don't think I said, you've reached a new low.</p>
<p id="p-162">So I guess I meant it as a family, as a whole, and not to single him out.</p>
<p id="p-163">So kind of a more humorous way that we say, you know, this, but like, if you wanna back off a little bit, you could say, we've reached a new low.</p>
<p id="p-164">Well, that would be a whole other episode, Michelle, guys, hit the follow button on the show.</p>
<p id="p-165">We're gonna have to cover this topic.</p>
<p id="p-166">We haven't covered this yet.</p>
<p id="p-167">This is a great one.</p>
<p id="p-168">How we, instead of, when we wanna say something directly to someone, instead of saying you, we say we, but we actually mean you.</p>
<p id="p-169">And it may be possible that it was a little bit of that too at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-170">I'm not sure, but I know I do this.</p>
<p id="p-171">instead of saying you, I'll say, oh, we, because I'm trying to soften it a little bit.</p>
<p id="p-172">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-173">It's interesting, you're trying to shift it a little bit so it's not so direct.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-174">Shifted a little bit so it's not so direct, so very interesting there.</p>
<p id="p-175">We'll definitely have to cover that.</p>
<p id="p-176">Guys, hit follow.</p>
<p id="p-177">Yeah, it's gonna be a great year, guys, so make sure you're following the show, and we'll follow up with that episode pretty soon.</p>
<p id="p-178">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-179">All right, Michelle, so where to from here?</p>
<p id="p-180">What else would, if you want to convey this idea, what else could you say?</p>
<p id="p-181">Yeah, so uh in a similar expression would be to stoop to a new level or a new low, right?</p>
<p id="p-182">So stoop, right, so go down.</p>
<p id="p-183">So for example, when she started personal insults, she really stooped to a new level, or you could say to a new low.</p>
<p id="p-184">Right, so you kind of cross a line and now things get really bad, right?</p>
<p id="p-185">Um, and this isn't really about playing, playing with someone or being sarcastic.</p>
<p id="p-186">This is just directly like you've gotten really bad, right?</p>
<p id="p-187">Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p id="p-188">Or I stooped to a new low when I spilled wine all over my boss.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-189">I spilled wine all over my boss.</p>
<p id="p-190">So this is tricky because you didn't do it on purpose, right?</p>
<p id="p-191">But you're just kind of saying, like, I got even more accident prone, maybe.</p>
<p id="p-192">You're very clumsy, right?</p>
<p id="p-193">Right, So this might be in more of a, you're self-deprecating, you know, oh my gosh, I really stooped to a new low.</p>
<p id="p-194">Yeah, it's a little bit playful.</p>
<p id="p-195">It is the way it's being used, is kind of playing around with the words, right?</p>
<p id="p-196">Yeah, So that's interesting.</p>
<p id="p-197">Here's another one, to have outdone oneself.</p>
<p id="p-198">So this is, you know, a really kind of in a sarcastic way.</p>
<p id="p-199">So it's like to have done even more than in the past.</p>
<p id="p-200">You're like, you've gone really far.</p>
<p id="p-201">So for example, I think this place has hit a downwards, oh, wait, nope, I'm in the wrong one.</p>
<p id="p-202">I didn't think I could be any more irritated at him, but he's outdone himself this time.</p>
<p id="p-203">So.</p>
<p id="p-204">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-205">He's gone further than you thought he could even go, right?</p>
<p id="p-206">Yes,</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-207">than you thought you could even go, right?</p>
<p id="p-208">Yeah, or, oh, no, I burnt the cookies.</p>
<p id="p-209">I've outdone myself.</p>
<p id="p-210">Although I think I've heard this used, though, in a genuine way, like if someone makes a really good dessert, oh, you've outdone yourself.</p>
<p id="p-211">This is the best dessert I've ever tasted from you, right?</p>
<p id="p-212">Right, so it could be used in more of a genuine positive way, and depending on the tone and the context, it could also be used in kind of a teasing way.</p>
<p id="p-213">So here you're being self-deprecating.</p>
<p id="p-214">I've outdone myself.</p>
<p id="p-215">Like I've outdone myself this time.</p>
<p id="p-216">Like, oh, last time I dropped it on the floor, this time I burnt them.</p>
<p id="p-217">Oh, gosh, you know?</p>
<p id="p-218">Wow, this is a very high-level episode.</p>
<p id="p-219">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-220">It's because we're trying to figure out which deliveries are genuine, sarcastic, teasing, or direct, right?</p>
<p id="p-221">And there's so much nuance here because there's context.</p>
<p id="p-222">There's vocabulary.</p>
<p id="p-223">There's personal history between you and the person.</p>
<p id="p-224">Wow, there's a lot here.</p>
<p id="p-225">What's another one, Michelle?</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-226">That is a lot.</p>
<p id="p-227">What's another one, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-228">One more.</p>
<p id="p-229">The last one we'll do is to hit a downward spiral.</p>
<p id="p-230">This is about, you know, think of an actual spiral, you're going down.</p>
<p id="p-231">I think this place has hit a downward spiral.</p>
<p id="p-232">It's probably going to close.</p>
<p id="p-233">So this is a more serious context, but what about the next, the next example?</p>
<p id="p-234">OK, here's the next one.</p>
<p id="p-235">OK, my shoe choice has hit a downward spiral.</p>
<p id="p-236">Will you go shopping with me this weekend?</p>
<p id="p-237">So here I'm making fun of myself, right?</p>
<p id="p-238">I am just saying, I have just lost my taste in shoes.</p>
<p id="p-239">I don't know what to do.</p>
<p id="p-240">It's OK to make fun of yourself pretty much any time, right?</p>
<p id="p-241">Especially if you're asking for help.</p>
<p id="p-242">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-243">And you could have said, okay, my shoe choice has reached a new low, right?</p>
<p id="p-244">So you could use that as well.</p>
<p id="p-245">But yeah, it's, I would say that's true for my shoes, actually.</p>
<p id="p-246">Oh yeah, are things getting worse when it comes to shoes for you, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-247">It's not getting worse, it's just that there's a lot.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-248">It's not getting worse, it's just that there is, I realize, I only realize in certain situations, like, oh, I don't have shoes for this occasion.</p>
<p id="p-249">I don't have anything.</p>
<p id="p-250">And, you know, so, but I don't realize it until it's that moment.</p>
<p id="p-251">It's the moment before you gotta walk out the door.</p>
<p id="p-252">I get it.</p>
<p id="p-253">I get it.</p>
<p id="p-254">Yeah, Shoe shopping is hard.</p>
<p id="p-255">I mean, if your feet don't fit most shoes, it can be really challenging for sure.</p>
<p id="p-256">I've been trying to buy a pair of boots for the last, like, three winters and I just give up every time.</p>
<p id="p-257">I just say, I'll just wear shoes in the snow.</p>
<p id="p-258">You sound, that's so me.</p>
<p id="p-259">Like, I, I would totally do the same thing.</p>
<p id="p-260">I just give up.</p>
<p id="p-261">All right, we have a great role play planned for our listeners today, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-262">So what's our scenario here?</p>
<p id="p-263">All right, so here we are best friends and we are looking at Instagram together.</p>
<p id="p-264">OK, all right, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-265">OK, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-266">Oh jeez, my time limit came up, meaning we've been doing this for two hours.</p>
<p id="p-267">Yikes.</p>
<p id="p-268">OK, we've hit a new low.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-269">We've hit a new low.</p>
<p id="p-270">Definitely, but I actually think we hit a downward spiral back when we started looking up fashion pictures.</p>
<p id="p-271">Oh, yes.</p>
<p id="p-272">Also, that's when I realized my fashion sense has stooped to a new level.</p>
<p id="p-273">We should go shopping.</p>
<p id="p-274">Uh, yes, but not at the mall.</p>
<p id="p-275">It's not nice anymore.</p>
<p id="p-276">You're right.</p>
<p id="p-277">It was getting bad, but now that terrible store that opened has outdone itself.</p>
<p id="p-278">Definitely.</p>
<p id="p-279">Yeah, that's a good example, um, because, and everyone on this podcast can probably relate to this feeling of as you get sucked into social media, you... There's always a moment where you realize what's happening, and you've hit a new, sometimes you've hit a new low, right?</p>
<p id="p-280">Because you've been there for a couple hours and you're just scrolling and scrolling and scrolling.</p>
<p id="p-281">It's terrible.</p>
<p id="p-282">And yeah, sometimes, like, for example, I have an alert come up on my phone when I've been on, but every, yeah, it would be good if I paid attention to it, but it's just, no, I just swipe it away.</p>
<p id="p-283">Okay, bye.</p>
<p id="p-284">I usually...</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p id="p-285">Usually I just fill my feed with like dog videos, like border collies and huskies and things, and those are less harmful for me, I guess, but it's still really, it just, it feels icky, just the scrolling, you know?</p>
<p id="p-286">And everyone knows exactly what we're talking about.</p>
<p id="p-287">That is a new low.</p>
<p id="p-288">That's a great example of this.</p>
<p id="p-289">So it's a great way to encapsulate this phrase.</p>
<p id="p-290">So basically I said, yikes, we've hit a new low when I realized, when you said we had been on for two hours scrolling.</p>
<p id="p-291">Um, and then I said definitely, but I actually think we hit a downward spiral back when we started looking up fashion pictures.</p>
<p id="p-292">So like, the downward spiral, it's like it got worse and worse and worse.</p>
<p id="p-293">So I'm saying the start of that was not, now that we've reached two hours, yeah, it's bad, but it was an hour ago when we started looking at fashion pictures that we couldn't stop.</p>
<p id="p-294">And it's funny how the technology just facilitates that, because if you click on one thing, the algorithm learns that you.</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p id="p-295">The algorithm learns that you want that and it gives you more of that, so you go down that rabbit hole, right, so it really becomes a downward spiral, literally created by technology.</p>
<p id="p-296">Interesting, right?</p>
<p id="p-297">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-298">And then I said, oh yes, also that's when I realized my fashion sense has stooped to a new low, right?</p>
<p id="p-299">So, meaning it's never been this bad.</p>
<p id="p-300">Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-301">And then you said we should go shopping, um, and then we were talking about The mall, but it's not nice at the mall, so you said it was getting, it was getting bad, but now that terrible store that opened has outdone itself, so it's even worse.</p>
<p id="p-302">Even worse.</p>
<p id="p-303">Oh my gosh, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-304">This has been an interesting episode.</p>
<p id="p-305">I think our listeners are really going to want to gain this skill of sensing when is it okay to say something sarcastic to whom, and when do we need to be more direct, right?</p>
<p id="p-306">Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-307">There is, there are a lot of layers to this episode.</p>
<p id="p-308">There's more than just, so here are the expressions, right?</p>
<p id="p-309">There's really a lot here.</p>
<h2>Part-21</h2>
<p id="p-310">expressions, right?</p>
<p id="p-311">There is really a lot here, personal relationships, using it seriously or in more of a comical way, a lot of layers that you have to think about when you're using these expressions.</p>
<p id="p-312">So I would say that's the takeaway for today, you know, really consider to whom you're talking to and what you're trying to say.</p>
<p id="p-313">And then, yeah, and give it a go.</p>
<p id="p-314">Also, head on over to episode 2530.</p>
<p id="p-315">That was given versus give up in English.</p>
