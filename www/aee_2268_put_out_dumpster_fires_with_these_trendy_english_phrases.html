<h2>Part-02</h2>
<p>After today's episode, you'll be ready to connect with others over bad days and life's problems and then you'll both feel better.</p>
<p>Good morning Aubrey.</p>
<p>How are you? I am great, Jessica.</p>
<p>I have a question for you.</p>
<p>Have you had to put out any dumpster fires recently? You know, I feel like as an adult there are kind of always dumpster fires to put out, um, no big dumpster fires to put out.</p>
<p>Thankfully.</p>
<p>What about you? Have you had to do that lately? Well, yes, with my kids school.</p>
<p>Um, they, they were really upset that they weren't going to be in the same class this year and they were both like, there's just some angst, even though they're not really old enough to have the angst.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>So there was a bit of a dumpster fire there that we had to put out.</p>
<p>I'm like, you know what this is for the best and, but not a literal dumpster fire.</p>
<p>Right, Jessica.</p>
<p>This is such a fun expression.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>This is such a fun expression.</p>
<p>So guys, this phrase came up on a recent Apple plus quiz that Aubrey and I were doing.</p>
<p>Um and I said the phrase dumpster fire and both of us are like, this is such a great phrase to teach.</p>
<p>We use this all the time as natives.</p>
<p>And so this is the metaphorical sense of dumpster fire, right? So a dumpster guys is that huge trash bin.</p>
<p>They are huge, huge trash bins.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, in Portland, there are literal dumpster fires because we have so many homeless people that sounds terrible.</p>
<p>But it's true.</p>
<p>Well, and it can happen anywhere because if someone throws a cigarette in a dumpster with a lot of paper, it can light on fire.</p>
<p>So there are literal dumpster fires, but we use it like you said, a metaphor and idiom for just something that is a terrible situation.</p>
<p>It's pretty extreme, like something where emotions are heightened.</p>
<p>Someone's really upset, something went terribly wrong.</p>
<p>We'll be like, what a dump.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>Went terribly wrong will be like what a dumpster fire.</p>
<p>That was.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But it's so much more fun to say, you know, it, it sort of improves a bad situation just a little bit because at least you can use fun words to connect with others about problems and we all have problems guys.</p>
<p>So today's vocabulary will make talking about those, those problems even more fun.</p>
<p>Yes, we're sharing five fun phrases related to garbage and dumpsters.</p>
<p>But that we use idiomatically, we use as slang.</p>
<p>You want to be using these.</p>
<p>But first of all, if the quiz Jessica was talking about is not familiar to you.</p>

<p>They're so fun.</p>
<p>Um Today's vocab guys is related to another all</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>Is related to another all ears English episode 2110, trashy English vocabulary was Lindsay and Michelle.</p>
<p>It was a fun when they talked about like, what is the difference between trash and garbage? But they also shared some fun phrases like trashy and trash talk.</p>
<p>So yeah, check that one out if you missed it.</p>
<p>Episode 2110 trashy English vocabulary.</p>
<p>Those oh my gosh, I want to go into that vocabulary but Michelle and Lindsay already did.</p>
<p>So listen to that guy and then let's get into today's new trashy vocabulary.</p>
<p>Yes, So first we're going to give you a few more examples of when you might say dumpster fire.</p>
<p>This means like a disastrous situation.</p>
<p>It's pretty extreme.</p>
<p>Maybe, for example, if you plan and run a fundraiser and it doesn't go well, you might say this fundraiser was a total dumpster fire.</p>
<p>We went over budget and then didn't even reach our goal.</p>
<p>Oh, that would be really terrible.</p>
<p>Oh, that sounds awful.</p>
<p>Um Or for example, we could say</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>Um or for example, we could say, um maybe like a friend walks up to you or you get home from work, you know, and uh your partner says, hey, you know what's going on? How was your day? You could say this day has been a dumpster fire.</p>
<p>I mean, first of all, like I missed the bus and I had to walk all the way to the, to work and then the heel broke off my shoe and I slipped in the mud.</p>
<p>I rocked up to the office covered in dirt and I had the most important meeting of my life today.</p>
<p>It was terrible.</p>
<p>Covered in mud.</p>
<p>That would be a dumpster fire.</p>
<p>Yes, this is definitely a phrase where if you just tell someone, you know, today was a dumpster fire, you're, they're going to want more information.</p>
<p>They're not gonna be like a bummer.</p>
<p>Like it's extreme enough and you're sort of almost setting up the story, right? You're introducing like the day was terrible and I'm gonna give you details.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, exactly.</p>
<p>Nobody stops at dumpster fire.</p>
<p>That's the thing, right? You want to spill those details and</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>Spill those details and vent to your friend.</p>
<p>Um All right.</p>
<p>So let's move on to the next term.</p>
<p>This one is very easy, very common garbage.</p>
<p>Um It's a down, it's slang, it's used for anything that's terrible.</p>
<p>It could be a bad movie, a bad book, a bad day, a bad relationship, a bad person.</p>
<p>You could use this to describe literally anything that is terrible.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Say this show is absolute garbage.</p>
<p>I don't like it at all.</p>
<p>If you're talking about a TV show or that book was such garbage.</p>
<p>Why did I waste my time? Yeah, totally.</p>
<p>Um Now let's be careful when we're describing people as garbage.</p>
<p>Um Maybe guys you shouldn't use this but you will hear this.</p>
<p>So for example, you might hear someone say, um you know, uh I hate to say it but she's kind of a garbage person.</p>
<p>It's a terrible cream.</p>
<p>I've heard this most often if you</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>I've heard this most often if you are asking a friend about someone they're dating and it went really terribly, they got ghosted.</p>
<p>They were mean, they'd be like, honestly, she turned out to be a garbage person, right? You'd say this because you feel still maybe hurt.</p>
<p>Like it's very extreme.</p>
<p>You're not going to say this about just like your neighbor who's not being super friendly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, it has to be like a really terrible person.</p>
<p>Um You know, the first thing that comes to mind for me is like, this is great guys if you watch reality TV shows because they're, they're like, written and produced, right? It's not real real.</p>
<p>So those producers on those shows are making certain people into garbage people because it's entertaining and they're edited that way, right? It's like the way they edit it made him look like a total garbage person.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So if you enjoy those shows, fantastic.</p>
<p>Talk about them with your friends and be like, oh man, Sabrina, that's a new person at this season is really a garbage person.</p>
<p>Yes, That leads really well into our next free</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>That leads really well into our next phrase here.</p>
<p>Trash, which we use as slang to mean terrible.</p>
<p>It's very similar to garbage.</p>
<p>But there's a specific phrase where we say trash TV, which is like reality TV.</p>
<p>Talk shows that are really not educational.</p>
<p>They're focusing on controversy and confrontation and like you said, Jessica, they're produced to make people look worse than they really are in person.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Um, I think of like Jerry Springer from the nineties, you know, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Um, do you watch any trash TV, Aubrey every now and then I got Peacock to watch the Olympics and Love Island is on there.</p>
<p>So I was like, I'm going to check out Love Island.</p>
<p>It is the definition of trash TV.</p>
<p>And you can really see how I'm sure these people are good people, but it's edited to make it more interesting and crazy.</p>
<p>But it's just such a waste of time, honestly.</p>
<p>No offense to everyone who loves reality TV.</p>
<p>But even if you love it, you have to admit it's such a waste of time.</p>
<p>I can't, I can't even</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>I can't, I can't even with reality TV.</p>
<p>I don't know if I watch trash TV.</p>
<p>I kind of feel like a trash person, you know, I'm like, oh, this makes me feel gross.</p>
<p>Ok? So some more examples, guys with the word trash, you could say uh sorry, the soup is absolute trash.</p>
<p>I think I used way too much salt.</p>
<p>So in that case, I made the soup, I can call it trash, right? I wouldn't say that about someone else's soup though.</p>
<p>That would be mean this is really mean to call something trash or garbage is so extreme.</p>
<p>If you use this to describe something someone did or made, it's very hurtful.</p>
<p>There's so many ways to say that that are more kind.</p>
<p>Yeah, totally.</p>
<p>Um OK, So here is, here's an interesting phrase guys that you, you might have heard because it, we do say this a lot.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, white trash.</p>
<p>OK, This is not a good term.</p>
<p>Guys.</p>
<p>We don't want you to say this but you might hear it and we want you to be ready.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>You might hear it and we want you to be ready, right.</p>
<p>So, Aubrey, how would you define that phrase? White trash? Yeah.</p>
<p>It's very derogatory and it's very informal.</p>
<p>It means it refers to an underprivileged white social group.</p>
<p>Right, So, for whatever reason and, and you'll hear it a lot on TV, on these reality shows we're talking about someone might call someone else this.</p>
<p>But like Jessica said, we're not recommending it because it is such a harsh judgment and it's really a pretty inappropriate thing to, of course, to base something on someone's race.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Um, it has connotations of like, this is what poor people do.</p>
<p>They are uneducated.</p>
<p>It's all, it's just judgment.</p>
<p>That's all it is.</p>
<p>It's really horrible judgment on another person.</p>
<p>So, I feel like it's going away.</p>
<p>Right, It used to be in older shows, eighties, nineties.</p>
<p>You might hear it all the time and more and more as we're starting to be more sensitive, recognizing stereotypes, we're hearing it less.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>Stereotypes.</p>
<p>We're hearing it less, thank goodness.</p>
<p>Right, This should, this should be kind of phased out.</p>
<p>Yeah, totally.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So, the last term today before we get to the role play rubbish, this is super fun because it's very British.</p>
<p>Right, It is British slang, but a lot of people in the US also use it these days.</p>
<p>Right, So it's the same as, like trash or garbage.</p>
<p>It's just British slang for the same thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It might be sort of being adopted in the States because we're hearing it on British TV shows and public and it's just so fun.</p>
<p>It's such a fun word to say.</p>
<p>But I do hear it in the USA lot as well.</p>
<p>It means worthless or useless.</p>
<p>Very similar to trash or garbage.</p>
<p>You might just say that's a bunch of rubbish.</p>
<p>I hear that often if I think someone's not telling the truth, that's rubbish.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>If you feel like, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Somebody is lying or, you know, has exaggerated somehow and it's just not true anymore what they're saying.</p>
<p>You're like, that's rubbish.</p>
<p>Just stop</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>That's rubbish, just stop it.</p>
<p>Um, or like what if you plug in your phone and it doesn't charge, you'd be like, uh, this battery is rubbish or this phone charger is rubbish.</p>
<p>Um, maybe you don't like your teacher.</p>
<p>Uh, he's a rubbish teacher.</p>
<p>I mean, these are all, I feel like garbage and trash because they're more meaningful to us.</p>
<p>We use them more that rubbish is slightly less harsh, you know, rubbish because it sounds British.</p>
<p>So it sounds better somehow.</p>
<p>It, I agree with less harsh.</p>
<p>I don't think I would say like he's a trash teacher.</p>
<p>He's a garbage teacher.</p>
<p>That sounds so awful and mean, but I would maybe say he's rubbish teacher.</p>
<p>If he's given me a grade, I don't feel I deserve it.</p>
<p>Doesn't feel so cruel.</p>
<p>It's a little more playful.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So, in this role play guys Aubrey and I are just leaving the movie theater, which if we lived in the same town would absolutely happen.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>We would go to the movies together for</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>We would go to the movies together for sure.</p>
<p>So this feels appropriate.</p>
<p>All right, you start us out.</p>
<p>All right, here we go.</p>
<p>That movie was a dumpster fire.</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>First time I've left a film early in a long time, rubbish, acting, trash, plot, garbage, writing.</p>
<p>I'd rather watch trash TV.</p>
<p>And that saying something, you know what else was garbage? The popcorn, Mike was soggy was yours? No, you must have added too much butter.</p>
<p>Talk about adding insult to injury.</p>
<p>We need to go to the movies again.</p>
<p>Sue to erase this night from existence.</p>
<p>It's so dramatic.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I kind of love this though.</p>
<p>I feel like if I left a movie and it was that bad, bad enough for me to leave early, I would be dramatic like this.</p>
<p>I'd be so disappointed.</p>
<p>I've only left the movies once.</p>
<p>I've only left the theaters once.</p>
<p>I was in high school and my mom and I were watching Dances with Wolves and we both hated it so much and we left.</p>
<p>That's the only time I've left.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>That's the only time I've left.</p>
<p>That's so funny.</p>
<p>I watched that a bunch of times as a kid.</p>
<p>I don't know why I hated it.</p>
<p>So really funny.</p>
<p>Oh, like let's go through this.</p>
<p>So, first of all, you said that movie was a dumpster fire automatically here.</p>
<p>You're sharing that you hated it.</p>
<p>You thought it was garbage? And I'm agreeing clearly, we've both left early.</p>
<p>So we agree.</p>
<p>And this is where I might say all of these, right? I'm listing them off rubbish acting, trash plot, garbage writing, meaning I hated everything about the movie and you could, you could mix up any of those, right? So, so Aubrey said rubbish acting, trash plot, garbage writing.</p>
<p>I could easily say garbage acting, um, rubbish plot.</p>
<p>Like you could just mix and match those guys.</p>
<p>So rubbish, trash garbage.</p>
<p>They all are, they could all be used interchangeable, interchangeable.</p>
<p>I couldn't think of that word.</p>
<p>And then you said I'd rather watch trash TV.</p>
<p>And that's saying something I love</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>And that's saying something.</p>
<p>I love this phrase.</p>
<p>That's saying something because we know each other well enough that I know you don't like reality TV.</p>
<p>Talk shows, you don't usually watch trash TV.</p>
<p>So you're using this to exaggerate to show how much you hated that movie.</p>
<p>I'd rather watch trash TV.</p>
<p>And that is saying something.</p>
<p>Right, Right, Um, and then you described your popcorn as soggy, right? Because you're like, you know, what else was garbage? The popcorn so soggy is just like wet, right? What popcorn? Oh If you guys are watching this on youtube, like I can't hide my emotions.</p>
<p>It's all on my face.</p>
<p>As soon as you said your popcorn was soggy.</p>
<p>I was like, oh God, that sounds so gross.</p>
<p>Soggy definitely has a negative connotation, right? Because there are things that should be wet or moist like a Trace Lee Chase cake.</p>
<p>But soggy means like it shouldn't, I feel like it shouldn't be wet.</p>
<p>Right, Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>It's, it's</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>It's, it's, yeah, it's gross wetness.</p>
<p>Um All right.</p>
<p>And then I said talk about adding insult to injury, another great phrase, guys.</p>
<p>So you can use this to comment on someone's news if it was like this bad thing happened after another bad thing, right? Um So it's like too many bad things happened.</p>
<p>You're like, oh talk about adding insult injury so that it's such a great empathetic phrase, right? Like, oh my gosh, I hear, I hear all of these bad things that happened to you or that you went through today and you know, I feel that's terrible.</p>
<p>Yes, Right, We're saying sort of like to top it all off this happened, which made it even worse.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>So many of these phrases are a great way to bond over something terrible that total, right? This is what we use the most often if someone watch something terrible or went through a terrible situation, this is a great way to support them to be like, oh man, I can't</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p>Them to be like, oh man, I can't believe that that's garbage.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Because a lot of times that your friends are venting to you, you know, we're not looking for solutions.</p>
<p>They're not looking for you to fix things.</p>
<p>A lot of times they just want an empathetic ear, right? So these phrases today guys, you can comment on a friend's bad day.</p>
<p>You can comment on a coworker's difficulties by just backing them up and saying, yeah, no, like that, that was garbage.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Like let's let's go get some coffee and some nice cheese cake.</p>
<p>That's such a good takeaway, right? We're all going to have Dumpster fire days.</p>
<p>We're all going to have these and it's really nice to have a friend who will support and use this vocabulary to help show them that support that you understand.</p>
<p>You've been through it too.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Um All right, Aubrey, I hope that none of your days this week are a dumpster fire.</p>
<p>Uh Thanks for having me on all their English.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Thanks for coming Jessica.</p>
