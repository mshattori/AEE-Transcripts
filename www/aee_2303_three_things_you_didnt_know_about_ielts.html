<p>Allearsenglish.com slash letter C number 1. Hello Aubrey.</p>
<p>How's it going?</p>
<p>I'm great.</p>
<p>How are you, Lindsay?</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>I'm excited to talk about something a little bit different today, but something that you and Jessica on a different podcast talk about all of the time.</p>
<p>We're talking about the IELTS exam.</p>
<p>So if you out there are listening and you are studying for IELTS or really any high stakes exam, we have some really good tips for you.</p>
<p>There have been some changes to the IELTS exam recently, and a lot of students aren't aware of this.</p>
<p>There's a lot of information out on the internet that you might find when you're searching that's outdated and could throw you off on test day.</p>
<p>Yes, And I'm sure you guys will also cover this over on the IELTS Energy podcast, but you'll go over there and check out that podcast.</p>
<p>It is fantastic.</p>
<p>But today's episode, what we're going to do is we are going to get very specific.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>is we are going to get very specific into updates on the test, but we're also going to tie in a key takeaway for each point for our listeners who may not be taking the IELTS exam.</p>
<p>Aubrey, why do people take the IELTS exam?</p>
<p>Why would I need to take the IELTS?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is a test that might be required if you are immigrating to an English-speaking country or if you are going to complete schooling in an English-speaking country.</p>
<p>Maybe a master's degree, a lot of schools will require this exam, and they're requiring high scores.</p>
<p>You can't go and just do your best.</p>
<p>Often, you have to really study.</p>
<p>You have to know the exam well to get high enough scores to be able to be admitted to these universities or to get the visa.</p>
<p>Yeah, so if you are actually taking that, go and subscribe.</p>
<p>Hit the follow button on IELTS Energy Podcast with Aubrey and Jessica, but let's get into tip number one or insider advice number one.</p>
<p>What do we know because we've been talking to examiners, like you said, right?</p>
<p>Exactly, right?</p>
<p>Jessica was an examiner for 14 years, but now we've stolen her.</p>
<p>We have her on the others.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>we've stolen her, we have her on the others English team, but she has a lot of current examiner friends.</p>
<p>So she stays updated with them of changes to the exam because IELTS does make changes and you might not know about them unless you are listening to the IELTS Energy podcast.</p>
<p>We, as soon as these changes were made, we updated listeners over there.</p>
<p>We're going to share here for anyone who hasn't been listening to the IELTS Energy podcast, but definitely hit follow over there so you don't miss these amazing tips and updates.</p>
<p>And the first one is about word count for the essays, right Lindsay?</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm actually surprised.</p>
<p>I'm actually reading this and thinking about it now.</p>
<p>I, wow.</p>
<p>So word count no longer exists for essays and writing.</p>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>For a long time, the IELTS exam, there was a penalty.</p>
<p>If you were under a certain amount of words, the examiners counted words.</p>
<p>You had to have 150 for task one, 250 for task two.</p>
<p>That has changed.</p>
<p>There is no word limit.</p>
<p>You know, examiners are not counting words and most students don't realize this.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>So you can submit as many, what you could write an</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>You can submit as many words, you could write an 800-word essay?</p>
<p>Well, there would be no penalty, or you could submit a 50-word essay, and there would not be a word count penalty.</p>
<p>Now here's the thing to keep in mind.</p>
<p>You still have to accomplish the task.</p>
<p>You have to answer that question fully with details and examples.</p>
<p>In order to do that, you're still going to need to be able to write about 150 to 200 words for task one, about 250 to 300 words for task two.</p>
<p>Without at least that amount of words, you can't accomplish the task fully.</p>
<p>But no one's counting your words.</p>
<p>You don't have to count your words.</p>
<p>Instead, you have to make sure to fully accomplish the task.</p>
<p>You also can't write too much, because what could happen if you write too much, Lindsay?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you could definitely just go on and on, waste time, and not really address... I think when something is tighter, it's just more addressing the goals of the essay and what you know you need in the templates and the structures.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And...</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>Structures.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And you only have an hour total for both essays.</p>
<p>So you do not have time to write more than that.</p>
<p>You're also setting yourself up to make more mistakes and then not have enough time to proofread and catch those errors if you write a lot more than that.</p>
<p>So you do want to aim for a certain amount.</p>
<p>You want to figure out about how many words there are per line when you're practicing.</p>
<p>You're aiming for about those numbers, but you don't want to waste time counting words.</p>
<p>The examiner's not counting words.</p>
<p>It's no longer a requirement to hit a certain word count.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So it's still a recommendation.</p>
<p>And in our Three Keys Out course, it's still a recommendation, I imagine, to do 250, 150, right?</p>
<p>But if you do 151, you're going to be fine.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Or 100.</p>
<p>It's not about the number of words.</p>
<p>It's about the scoring system.</p>
<p>Are you really answering the question?</p>
<p>Are you getting it done in time?</p>
<p>And do you have time to proofread and catch some of these errors?</p>
<p>So rather than worrying about...</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>errors.</p>
<p>So rather than worrying about the number of words you're writing, we teach you in 3 Keys IELTS and we teach over on the IELTS Energy podcast what the examiner is looking for in your essays, what you really need to be worrying about when you're practicing to write these high-scoring essays.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So I love that our advice, even though the rules have changed, our advice is still to stay within that original range.</p>
<p>And there's a reason for that.</p>
<p>We want to be concise.</p>
<p>And how does this apply to our listeners who are not taking IELTS?</p>
<p>There's still a lesson in here for all of us when it comes to writing emails.</p>
<p>Yes, Imagine, I know everyone out there has received an email that was really wordy, that was much longer than it needed to be, right?</p>
<p>There is a message here for all of us out here to be concise with emails.</p>
<p>Everyone is busy.</p>
<p>We don't have a ton of time.</p>
<p>We want to like hit the main points and say it with as few words as possible.</p>
<p>Yes, Especially we need to look at culture here too.</p>
<p>When you're doing business with people in the United States, it's especially important.</p>
<p>There's much less about your background.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>there's much less about your background.</p>
<p>Maybe in an intro email, you have a few things about your background if you're trying to get someone to kind of call you back, but go straight to the facts.</p>
<p>Just keep it to the facts, right?</p>
<p>Keep it to the point, the actions, what am I supposed to do?</p>
<p>Finish up with, you know, what do we expect our next steps will be?</p>
<p>And we'll do more templates of this in the future, Aubrey.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>We talk about emails a lot here on the All Ears English podcast.</p>
<p>Be sure to hit follow if you've missed any of those and on Business English too, because writing emails, there's a lot to it.</p>
<p>It's cultural, like you said, Lindsay, but it's also about respecting someone's time.</p>
<p>Right, which is very cultural too.</p>
<p>Yes, right.</p>
<p>It's all wrapped up together.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>Okay, number two, the next thing we need to know if we're taking IELTS is that timing has become more strict for speaking.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So they've dropped the word limit or they've changed the no more word limits, but then timing is more strict for speaking.</p>
<p>So they've made something more strict and something less strict.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So this is something that's made sort of, it's become more difficult for.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>it's become more difficult for the examiners because there are a certain amount of questions they have to ask in the time and they put more restrictions on them.</p>
<p>For example, they have to start the recording device before you ever enter the room and they're not allowed to greet you, which may feel strange if they're not just saying, hello, how are you doing today?</p>
<p>Like you're already being recorded.</p>
<p>They are going to get started with that test right away.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So it sounds like maybe a lot of time was being wasted sitting down, people maybe not being ready for the recording to start yet.</p>
<p>Yeah, There's just no nonsense now.</p>
<p>You're already testing when you walk in that door.</p>
<p>Yeah, And there are quite a few things that you need to be ready for.</p>
<p>For example, you might be interrupted more, especially in part three, because the examiners watching the time that they have, they may have to interrupt you and ask the next question because they are required to ask a certain amount of questions.</p>
<p>So you often need to answer the question right away, be pretty concise.</p>
<p>You can't kind of ramble</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>concise.</p>
<p>You can't kind of ramble for a while before you get there.</p>
<p>The examiner might have to interrupt you before you have fully answered the question, and that will lower your score.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think this comes back to the flow of everyday conversation as well.</p>
<p>You know, the person you're sitting with in that examination room has a job to do, and the same thing is true in everyday life, right?</p>
<p>We need to be as concise as we can.</p>
<p>Everyone has a message they want to get across.</p>
<p>We have, you know, we have to be in sync with the person in front of us, Aubrey.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>We all know someone who rambles, right?</p>
<p>They just will kind of give lots of details.</p>
<p>TMI will say too much information before they actually get to the point.</p>
<p>This can be difficult whether you're at work or just in daily life.</p>
<p>It can be frustrating to sort of sit, especially if you have something you want to say or you know they have, like the, you know, the point of their message is going to be exciting.</p>
<p>You start getting for them to get there.</p>
<p>And also, I think the more words we say, the less influential</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>words we say, the less influential each word is.</p>
<p>Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p>If you think about that, it's true.</p>
<p>Someone that just talks and talks and talks, maybe we just stop listening, right?</p>
<p>But that person who doesn't speak quite as much, but they speak well when they do at the right time with impact, that person is listening to more.</p>
<p>So this is a very important point.</p>
<p>Yeah, And it's the same for what you're saying.</p>
<p>If you have something impactful to say, but you hide it in all of these extra details and ramblings, a lot of people listening might not get your message.</p>
<p>Yeah, So don't hide what matters, what you're really trying to say.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>This is so good.</p>
<p>So we're getting some really nice takeaways today for all of our listeners, even if they're not entering the IELTS exam center this year.</p>

<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>Okay, Aubrey, let's get into something very specifically IELTS, which is computer delivered IELTS is better.</p>
<p>We believe it's better.</p>
<p>Why, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Why is it better?</p>
<p>Yeah, So there are a few things.</p>
<p>There is a listening exam that if you take it on the computer, you're still in a test center, but you can control the volume of the audio.</p>
<p>You're wearing headphones, which eliminate distractions in the room.</p>
<p>If you're taking paper delivered IELTS, the audio might be coming from a stereo system across the room.</p>
<p>The person next to you might be noisy.</p>
<p>It might be harder to hear this listening audio and that can affect your score.</p>
<p>Oh, for sure.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>So the reason we're giving this tip is that most of the time, is it true that most people still have a choice?</p>
<p>Aubrey, they can choose.</p>
<p>In a lot of places, computer delivered IELTS is still offered.</p>
<p>Paper delivered IELTS is still offered everywhere.</p>
<p>So there may be places where you unfortunately don't have the option to take computer delivered, but if you do have...</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>to take computer-delivered, but if you do have the option, we definitely recommend that.</p>
<p>Or maybe if it's between driving to two different cities, right?</p>
<p>One city only has computers, maybe think about doing that and we're telling you why right now.</p>
<p>And the next reason is writing.</p>
<p>On the writing exam, why Aubrey?</p>
<p>Why is it better?</p>
<p>On the computer-delivered exam, you're typing the essays instead of handwriting.</p>
<p>We do a lot more typing than writing by hand these days, so this might be quite a bit faster for you.</p>
<p>It's also a lot better if you have bad handwriting and it's difficult and slow for you to make your handwriting clear enough for the examiner.</p>
<p>There can be a lot of benefits to typing your essays instead.</p>
<p>You can also delete a chunk and rewrite it instead of crossing it out and writing it, which of course you can do on the paper-delivered IELTS, but a lot faster on the computer.</p>
<p>Yeah, Don't you think everyone has bad handwriting now because we don't write?</p>
<p>We don't write.</p>
<p>I'm looking at my... I do have a couple notes here.</p>
<p>And it's just bad.</p>
<p>It's bad, bad handwriting.</p>
<p>It's a huge letter.</p>
<p>Imagine having to write a whole essay.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>Imagine having to write a whole essay clearly and neatly.</p>
<p>That is going to take more time than you could just type it.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>Just stay in the mode that you're already in every day, right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Being online.</p>
<p>So there's one reading tip and then we're going to talk about how we've actually adopted a special technology and we haven't, we've tried not to go back to writing.</p>
<p>So what about reading though first?</p>
<p>Reading.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So the reading exam is easier on the computer for IELTS because instead of flipping pages to go from the passage to the questions, there's a split screen so that you can see the questions right next to the passage.</p>
<p>This is huge.</p>
<p>And you can also highlight text and mark questions for later review.</p>
<p>So this is so much easier rather than flipping back and forth and looking in the passage, go back to the question.</p>
<p>It's easier.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>And in our Course 3 Keys IELTS, our computer version, we do show you what those screens look like, right?</p>
<p>We had Jessica go and take the IELTS computer up in Canada one year and she came back and showed us.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>and she came back and showed us everything.</p>
<p>This is what it looks like, right?</p>
<p>When you take the computer IELTS and we have that in our course, a lot of courses probably don't bother to do that.</p>
<p>They just show you their version of a computer test, but it's not what IELTS looks like, right?</p>
<p>We put a lot of work into making our Three Keys IELTS program prepare you for computer-delivered IELTS as well.</p>
<p>This is really the way the world is going.</p>
<p>It could be one day that that's the only possibility.</p>
<p>Right now you don't have the option for either.</p>
<p>Yeah, it makes sense.</p>
<p>So yes, when you sign up for Three Keys IELTS, we prepare you for both options.</p>
<p>And I think the overall message for all of our listeners is see if you can adopt one piece of technology that will just make your life a little smoother, right?</p>
<p>We've adopted monday.com.</p>
<p>We might change our task management system in the future.</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>It doesn't matter, but I think it helps.</p>
<p>Aubrey, does it help you?</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>I think a lot of us were writing lists.</p>
<p>We had a handwritten list somewhere and then maybe somewhere else we had another list and this has really facilitated.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p>list.</p>
<p>And this has really facilitated just making it easier to stay organized.</p>
<p>But whether you need, you know, software to keep you organized, or maybe your vocabulary list, maybe you could use an app to make that easier, an Excel spreadsheet, right?</p>
<p>You might be still writing in a handwritten notebook and you may want to consider, is there a better option for me?</p>
<p>Yes, I love it.</p>
<p>So today we've gotten a lot of good little takeaways for our listeners if they're not taking the test and a lot of very specific ones.</p>
<p>These are big changes, especially that first one, Aubrey, around word count.</p>
<p>I'm actually, I had not heard about that till now, because you guys are in charge of the IELTS stuff over there.</p>
<p>And so I'm actually kind of surprised, but that's a big deal.</p>
<p>Size of shift.</p>
<p>Yeah, a lot of things that we share over on the IELTS Energy podcast that are changes to the exam like this, but also we'll find out from examiners like common mistakes students are making, or essay topics that are really tripping people up when they switch to starting to do more mixed essays.</p>
<p>This was confusing for students.</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p>text essays.</p>
<p>This was confusing for students.</p>
<p>So you want to make sure you're listening to the IELTS Energy podcast so that you're getting all of those insider tips.</p>
<p>And that's it, guys.</p>
<p>So go and check out the IELTS Energy podcast.</p>
<p>Any final takeaway for our students if they're studying IELTS?</p>
<p>Anything?</p>
<p>I mean, I think that's it.</p>
<p>Like any exam you're taking is going to be really specific.</p>
<p>Whether you're taking TESOL or IELTS or a different high-stakes exam, you need to know all of the specifics about what to expect on test day.</p>
<p>It's really going to give you more confidence to go in there knowing you know what to expect.</p>
<p>There won't be any surprises.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, we've seen students write to us and say, I'm taking TOEFL.</p>
<p>Can I take your IELTS course?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It's a TOEFL.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Take a TOEFL course.</p>
<p>Take a TOEFL course.</p>
<p>The IELTS, our course is very, very specific only for IELTS.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>It's not for any other test, TOEIC, TOEFL, nothing else.</p>
<p>Prepare for the test you're going to take because there's always different strategies for each one.</p>
<p>Yes, Very different.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>All right, Aubrey, thanks for being on the show and enlightening us about these</p>
