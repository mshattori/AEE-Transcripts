<p>Hey, Aubrey, how's it going today? Hey, Lindsay.</p>
<p>I am wondering because we're talking about this today.</p>
<p>Do you have any friends that you've lost touch with? Sadly, yes, I've watched.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>Sadly, yes, I've lost touch with a few people, especially because I spent a lot of my twenties living abroad and I met some very cool people that I wish I had made lifelong friends.</p>
<p>But life just moved on once we went home and it's trickier because Facebook didn't exist.</p>
<p>Like when I lived in Montreal and Europe, we weren't friends on social media.</p>
<p>So unless you wrote letters or called, it was harder to stay in touch letters.</p>
<p>So antiquated.</p>
<p>Right, Thinking about writing letters now.</p>
<p>Right, There was no mechanism for that, to be honest.</p>
<p>Or I think the time I was abroad, Facebook was just getting started in 2005, 6789.</p>
<p>So, yeah, now it would be different.</p>
<p>I think you're right.</p>
<p>It's definitely easier.</p>
<p>Right, But still we have to proactively keep those connections or even if you are friends on social media, I'm sure this happens to you too.</p>
<p>Lindsay, there may be like months or years that go by where all you see are they like Facebook updates and you're still not, you know, putting in the effort to keep that friendship strong</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>Effort to keep that friendship strong.</p>
<p>It's so true.</p>
<p>It's so true.</p>
<p>So today's episode is getting to this topic, right? How to greet a friend when you haven't seen them for a long time.</p>
<p>And this question came from youtube.</p>
<p>What was the question, Aubrey? Exactly.</p>
<p>Someone commented on youtube.</p>
<p>Definitely guys, if you want to watch our episodes on youtube, it's fun to see the video.</p>
<p>There.</p>
<p>Someone commented, can you record an episode for meeting a friend we've not seen for a long time? I love this question.</p>
<p>It is, there is different vocabulary.</p>
<p>There are different things you'd say when it's been a while.</p>
<p>Yes, 100% 100% guys go ahead and hit follow on this podcast.</p>
<p>Don't miss it, right? Make sure you catch all five of our episodes today that come out five times a week, guys.</p>
<p>Make sure you catch it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Good stuff.</p>
<p>Let's start up with some great vocab here and fun, interesting things that you can say it's been ages.</p>
<p>So you might say so good.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>So you might say so good to see you.</p>
<p>It's been ages, which means it's been a long time since we've seen each other.</p>
<p>It's definitely a fun way to exaggerate.</p>
<p>It's been ages, right? Really? Putting your intonation into that? Um, I can't, or you could say, I can't believe how long it's been since I've seen you.</p>
<p>It's seriously been ages.</p>
<p>So you'll see sort of a running theme here that if you reach out to someone you haven't talked to in a while or if you run into them, you want to comment on it.</p>
<p>It'd be kind of weird to be like, hey, how's it going? You want to use one of these phrases to point out that it's been a long time and, and you're sort of saying it's a bummer, like, oh, it's a bummer that it's been so long since we've seen each other.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the next one is going to let you do that too.</p>
<p>It's another way to do that.</p>
<p>A very native slangy way to say it.</p>
<p>Right, It's been forever.</p>
<p>Yes, Or I haven't seen you in forever and we really emphasize forever.</p>
<p>What a fun way to exaggerate.</p>
<p>It's fun.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So good to see you.</p>
<p>It's been forever.</p>
<p>Right,</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>Forever.</p>
<p>Right, I haven't seen you in forever.</p>
<p>How have you been? It's kind of strange the way we put it there, but we do all the time.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>And then another one to say Aubrey would be what to say that you have lost touch or that you've been out of touch.</p>
<p>So I might say my dad and I have been out of touch for a while.</p>
<p>So this is sort of a bonus of how you can talk to someone else about a friend or a family member that you haven't seen for a while that you've lost touch with you, talking to someone you could be like, I can't believe we lost touch.</p>
<p>It's been ages and again, it happens easily, right? Because we're just busy and you kind of just they fall off your radar.</p>
<p>Right? Would, would be, we could use that for different things maybe more like I wouldn't say it to someone's name.</p>
<p>You fell off my radar because I kind of like I forgot about you.</p>
<p>But we say this and it's like, oh, this person fell off my radar.</p>
<p>Yes, 100%.</p>
<p>100%</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>Yes, 100% 100%.</p>
<p>Yeah, you might say, oh, sorry, go ahead, Aubrey.</p>
<p>Did you have another example? I was just going to say another example is I lost touch with my childhood best friend.</p>
<p>So just like if there is someone that you haven't seen in a while, then you could say you lost touch.</p>
<p>Yes, 100% love it.</p>
<p>OK, Aubrey, let's take a look at a role play where we're going to bring these all together into one conversation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And this roleplay shows how we can use these phrases not only to meet up with a friend we haven't seen in a while, but also to connect about whether or not we have kept in touch with friends.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There's always that meta conversation that we can have, right? And so almost every episode, we show you the literal functions of that conversation and then you can always take that to a way to talk about that kind of conversation or that kind of circumstance.</p>
<p>You guys have a lot of connection options today.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Don't reserve these just for when you run into a friend you haven't seen in forever use this to connect with anyone ask them like.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>To connect with anyone ask them like Lindsay did at the top of the episode if they stay in touch with friends all the time.</p>
<p>I mean, for example, I am still in close touch with my best friend from high school.</p>
<p>Um, and so we meet up every time I'm back in New England, I give her a call, go over to her house, whatever.</p>
<p>But I'm not as in touch with our other third best friend or close friend.</p>
<p>And I always ask her about how that person is doing and I say, oh, I've really lost touch with this person, you know.</p>
<p>Um, and so that would be that kind of conversation.</p>
<p>Have you kept in touch? It's been ages since we've talked and you guys would talk about, you know, these other friends that you might have lost touch with.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So here Aubrey and this role play, we are again chatting about those high school friends.</p>
<p>I'll start us out.</p>
<p>Have you stayed in touch with anyone from high school? A few people? Yeah.</p>
<p>But I've lost touch with most of them.</p>
<p>I didn't go to any of my high school reunions.</p>
<p>So it's been ages since I've seen any of them.</p>
<p>What about childhood friends? It's been forever.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>Childhood friends.</p>
<p>It's been forever since I saw any of them.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>I'm totally out of touch with all of them.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>This is really true for me.</p>
<p>I have not kept in touch with very many childhood friends every now and then.</p>
<p>If I go back to Idaho for like Fourth of July, I'll run into someone from elementary school or high school and this is what I would say.</p>
<p>It's been ages.</p>
<p>How have you been or? I haven't seen you in forever.</p>
<p>It's kind of like the plot of every movie, right? It's the plot of, what is that movie? Sweet Home Alabama where she goes back to Alabama.</p>
<p>Great movie.</p>
<p>Run into people you haven't seen in forever.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like her life has changed completely.</p>
<p>She's living in New York and she comes back great movie if you haven't seen it guys.</p>
<p>Um, so you said first, what did you say Aubrey? I said, have you stayed in touch with anyone from high school? So that means have you stayed in contact? Have you been speaking with them? Yeah.</p>
<p>And then I said a few people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I've lost touch with most of them.</p>
<p>Right, So, stayed in touch, lost touch is the opposite to me.</p>
<p>Like, no, I haven't stayed in touch.</p>
<p>We haven't.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>Like, no, I haven't stayed in touch.</p>
<p>We haven't really been talking.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>And then you said I didn't go to any of my high school reunion.</p>
<p>So it's been ages since I saw any of them.</p>
<p>It's, it's been a long time.</p>
<p>I'm exaggerating ages.</p>
<p>It's been since the Jurassic period that I haven't seen any of them definitely hyperbole here.</p>
<p>And I'm curious if this is the same in other countries.</p>
<p>If you have this, these high school reunions are where years later you all meet up just to see, you know, what's changed in your lives and I haven't gone to any of them.</p>
<p>Have you, Lindsay? No, I went to my five year but five years.</p>
<p>Like, what, nothing, nothing changed in your life.</p>
<p>Um, since then I have not, I think there are some places in the country where you're more likely to find groups still together from high school, like adults.</p>
<p>Like you're 40 you have kids and now you're still hanging out with your high school friends.</p>
<p>I, I remember being at a party once.</p>
<p>I think I shared this on the podcast.</p>
<p>My friend g, um, he obviously has branched out but is still close to some high school friends as well.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>Close to some high school friends as well and I was at a party with him and all of a sudden they started breaking out the high school year book and then I thought it's time to go home.</p>
<p>I had to go home now because I don't really care about your high school year.</p>
<p>I know anyone you're talking about.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It kind of becomes a little weird, I guess for spouses probably.</p>
<p>Or girlfriends, boyfriends, partners.</p>
<p>But also just anyone I know that's kind of a trope that anyone, your partner is always dreading going to these high school reunions because you're catching up your shit, these old stories reminiscing and they're, they're like, I don't know any of these people.</p>
<p>I wasn't here for any of this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Completely.</p>
<p>Completely.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Where did we leave off here? Aubrey? I had said it's been ages since I went to these reunions.</p>
<p>And then you said, what about childhood friends? It's been forever since I saw any of them.</p>
<p>And I think they're talking about when we're very young.</p>
<p>Like, pre high school, elementary school.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>Yes, Could you imagine? Just see, like, because you remember them as a kid as like an eight year old kid.</p>
<p>And then imagine seeing them now.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>It's crazy.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>And then imagine seeing them.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>It's crazy.</p>
<p>I had a crazy experience this summer where I was playing Pickleball and someone came up to me and they were like Aubrey, they knew me and I didn't recognize them at all and they told me who they were, I hadn't seen them since they were probably 10.</p>
<p>So, of course, I'm not going to recognize them.</p>
<p>I don't know how they recognized me.</p>
<p>Wow, that is.</p>
<p>So, that's so crazy.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>And by the way, this one, it's been forever is the one I use the most I would say personally.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do too.</p>
<p>I think so too.</p>
<p>It's been forever.</p>
<p>Just means it's been a long time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then the last one you said? Nope, I'm totally out of touch with all of them also.</p>
<p>Very common.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And this is interesting because out of touch can mean sort of like uninformed as well.</p>
<p>There are a couple of different meanings of this in English, but in this case, it means I've lost touch.</p>
<p>I haven't stayed in contact.</p>
<p>Yes, 100%.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Now, there is another episode that our listeners could check out that is related to this.</p>
<p>It's kind of complimentary, but they need to go over to the Business English Podcast.</p>
<p>Right, Aubrey.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That was Business English.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That was Business English episode 288.</p>
<p>Who should you greet when arriving at work? And we gave you great phrases there for greetings at work.</p>
<p>So if you work in Business English, you definitely want to check that one out.</p>
<p>Yes, I love it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Good stuff, Aubrey.</p>
<p>Where should we leave our listeners today? What is the final thought of the day? Yeah, there is a lot here.</p>
<p>Not only do you need these phrases when you run into a friend you haven't seen in quite a while or reach out to them maybe over social media.</p>
<p>But also, you know, sharing with a friend whether or not you have kept in touch with people is a great way to connect.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So these phrases are functional for many different kind of conversations, one on one conversations, no matter what, whoever you're talking to, it's very useful guys and super common like I said, especially that it's been forever all the time.</p>
<p>Everywhere.</p>
<p>Use these right.</p>
<p>Ask a friend or a family member if they've kept in touch and use these phrases to share whether you have or not.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Good stuff, Aubrey.</p>
