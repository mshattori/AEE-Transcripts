<p id="p-11">Learn super native and natural chunks today.</p>
<p id="p-12">Hey, Lindsay, how are you?</p>
<p id="p-13">Hey, Michelle, I'm doing good.</p>
<p id="p-14">I'm happy to be on the microphone with you today.</p>
<p id="p-15">I do have a question for you, though.</p>
<p id="p-16">Are you ready?</p>
<p id="p-17">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-18">All right.</p>
<p id="p-19">Sure.</p>
<p id="p-20">So is there anyone that you wish you knew better in your life, but you just haven't had that chance to get to know them?</p>
<p id="p-21">Anyone you can think of?</p>
<p id="p-22">Well, you know, I've moved to a new place.</p>
<p id="p-23">And so a lot of most people I meet are new to me.</p>
<p id="p-24">So there are people that when you meet them right away, you kind of you almost feel like you could be friends with that person.</p>
<p id="p-25">But as an adult, it takes a little bit of time.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-26">a little bit of time to kind of move that forward.</p>
<p id="p-27">So certainly there have been a lot of people who I meet who I think I would like to get to know you better.</p>
<p id="p-28">But I can't think of anybody specifically.</p>
<p id="p-29">What about you?</p>
<p id="p-30">Yeah, actually, someone comes to mind who I was just chatting with last night.</p>
<p id="p-31">So there's this guy I know.</p>
<p id="p-32">He is in my meditation community.</p>
<p id="p-33">So it's kind of cool when you realize that you overlap with someone in like three different aspects of your life.</p>
<p id="p-34">And I realized with this particular guy, so he's in my meditation community, which is probably 50 people in the city of Denver that we go on Sundays and we meditate together.</p>
<p id="p-35">So that's one.</p>
<p id="p-36">He is in my run club, which means he likes to run and he likes to drink beer because we go for beer after the run.</p>
<p id="p-37">That's what we were chatting last night at the run club.</p>
<p id="p-38">And he lives an active life.</p>
<p id="p-39">He likes to ski and hike.</p>
<p id="p-40">He likes to hike and camp and be outdoors.</p>
<p id="p-41">And I was like, oh, my gosh, we share three huge aspects.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-42">We share three huge aspects of our lives in common, and I would like to get to know him better.</p>
<p id="p-43">I think we will.</p>
<p id="p-44">I think we'll become friends.</p>
<p id="p-45">It's just a matter of time.</p>
<p id="p-46">You know, you can't push things and try to make something happen.</p>
<p id="p-47">It has to happen very naturally.</p>
<p id="p-48">Right, It's so true.</p>
<p id="p-49">It's so true.</p>
<p id="p-50">All right.</p>
<p id="p-51">Well, let us know how it goes.</p>
<p id="p-52">I hope so.</p>
<p id="p-53">Yeah, totally.</p>
<p id="p-54">So, Michelle, this episode is based on a listener question, right?</p>
<p id="p-55">Cool.</p>
<p id="p-56">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-57">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-58">And it was given to us on YouTube.</p>
<p id="p-59">Yes, But before we read the question, we want to let you guys know that we are super excited about our brand new course that is coming out soon.</p>
<p id="p-60">Lindsay, tell us a little bit about it.</p>
<p id="p-61">I am excited.</p>
<p id="p-62">So, guys, this is new.</p>
<p id="p-63">It is new and shiny and never seen before, right?</p>
<p id="p-64">This is our advanced level English course.</p>
<p id="p-65">And so, for our listeners who are in B1, B2, which we launched earlier this year and last year, you'll be ready now for C1.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-66">now for C1.</p>
<p id="p-67">It includes the connection method, of course, which means everything is based on real conversations.</p>
<p id="p-68">We don't manufacture any language.</p>
<p id="p-69">And there's lots of new ways to speak now if you're involved with our courses.</p>
<p id="p-70">So open conversation club, weekly Q&amp;A, monthly fluency party where we get to meet you guys.</p>
<p id="p-71">So get on the list.</p>
<p id="p-72">It is an exclusive list.</p>
<p id="p-73">Well, you'll make sure that you hear about it when it goes live and becomes available.</p>
<p id="p-74">Michelle, what's that link to go and get on that list?</p>
<p id="p-75">Yeah, guys, go to allearsenglish.com slash C1.</p>
<p id="p-76">That's the letter C, number one.</p>
<p id="p-77">All right, good stuff.</p>
<p id="p-78">So this particular YouTube listener, again, it's at 775 Shah Rukh, right?</p>
<p id="p-79">What did they ask?</p>
<p id="p-80">What does all too well mean?</p>
<p id="p-81">They say, how is I know you different from I know you all too well?</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-82">you all too well.</p>
<p id="p-83">Does that express sarcasm?</p>
<p id="p-84">So, this is a good question.</p>
<p id="p-85">I'm excited to dive into this one.</p>
<p id="p-86">Yeah, it seems like a simple question, but it actually opens a whole language mechanism that we're going to teach you guys today that's quite high level, actually.</p>
<p id="p-87">This one would fall into the B2C1 level, but it is accessible to all of our listeners today.</p>
<p id="p-88">So, let's get into it, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-89">Where do we start?</p>
<p id="p-90">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-91">So, I think that this expression, all too well, has become more popular because there's... Do you know this song?</p>
<p id="p-92">I didn't know that.</p>
<p id="p-93">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-94">Taylor Swift, she named a song.</p>
<p id="p-95">She has a song and it's called All Too Well.</p>
<p id="p-96">I'm not a Swifty or anything, but I know this song.</p>
<p id="p-97">And so, it's called All Too Well.</p>
<p id="p-98">So, I'm wondering if maybe this listener has heard this in the Swifty world, but I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-99">Very possible.</p>
<p id="p-100">Very possible.</p>
<p id="p-101">But it's not only Taylor.</p>
<p id="p-102">She didn't make this up.</p>
<p id="p-103">She made up the song, but she didn't make up the expression.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-104">she made up the song, but she didn't make up the expression all too well.</p>
<p id="p-105">But yeah, if you want to listen to that song, apparently it's a, you know, I think it's a very long song, but I think it's very good.</p>
<p id="p-106">It'd be an interesting challenge to have our listeners before they listen to this episode, go listen to that song and see if you can figure out the meaning of it based on listening to the song and then come back to this and hit play on this episode again.</p>
<p id="p-107">That would be kind of cool.</p>
<p id="p-108">That would be fun.</p>
<p id="p-109">Yeah, So, um, let's talk about what this means outside of the Swiftie world.</p>
<p id="p-110">Um, so the listener asks, what is the difference between I know you and I know you all too well.</p>
<p id="p-111">So yeah, it's very interesting.</p>
<p id="p-112">So let's start with, I know you, what do you think about this one?</p>
<p id="p-113">This is very straightforward, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-114">So it's basic sounding.</p>
<p id="p-115">I know you, meaning I'm familiar with you.</p>
<p id="p-116">I maybe you're a friend or an acquaintance.</p>
<p id="p-117">I have an understanding of you.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-118">I have an understanding of you, okay?</p>
<p id="p-119">Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.</p>
<p id="p-120">So, I mean, for example, oh, I know you.</p>
<p id="p-121">I can't believe we're running into each other here.</p>
<p id="p-122">Yes, I like that.</p>
<p id="p-123">Or, can I read the next one, Michelle, the next example?</p>
<p id="p-124">Yes, well, so this one's a little bit different.</p>
<p id="p-125">So this one, do you ever hear when someone goes, I know you.</p>
<p id="p-126">I know you, right.</p>
<p id="p-127">So we're gonna have to differentiate between these two.</p>
<p id="p-128">So let me do the next one, and then we'll see the difference here.</p>
<p id="p-129">So these are little variations on just I know you, right.</p>
<p id="p-130">So, oh, come on, I know you.</p>
<p id="p-131">You would never skip dessert.</p>
<p id="p-132">Are you feeling okay?</p>
<p id="p-133">All right, that's me, that's me for sure.</p>
<p id="p-134">Is that you, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-135">Yeah, I was thinking about you and your ice cream.</p>
<p id="p-136">Oh, I remember.</p>
<p id="p-137">If I have an opportunity to get dessert, I will definitely.</p>
<p id="p-138">Yeah, yeah, someone might think, if you don't get ice cream, Lindsay, somebody might think, oh my gosh, is Lindsay feeling okay?</p>
<p id="p-139">Well, the worst is when, like, you know, you're celebrating someone's birthday or you're out for an event, and you think that you.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-140">out for an event and you think that you see eye-to-eye with this person on dessert choice, but it's their choice for the dessert and everyone's gonna get it.</p>
<p id="p-141">And then they choose something really wrong.</p>
<p id="p-142">Okay, I have a question for you.</p>
<p id="p-143">Is there a dessert that you don't really like?</p>
<p id="p-144">Yeah, I mean, so it's not that I don't like any dessert.</p>
<p id="p-145">It's more when I have an option for something like deep and robust chocolatey, and then someone goes and chooses like a lemon cake or a creme brulee, I get so disappointed and almost upset with them.</p>
<p id="p-146">Well, you're thinking you're sharing the dessert, right?</p>
<p id="p-147">You're like, right.</p>
<p id="p-148">Yeah, that is so funny.</p>
<p id="p-149">Well, so for me, it's carrot cake.</p>
<p id="p-150">I... Oh, you hate it again.</p>
<p id="p-151">But what about the frosting?</p>
<p id="p-152">It's so good, that cream cheese frosting, you don't like that?</p>
<p id="p-153">To me, there's no point for the whole thing.</p>
<p id="p-154">I mean, but I do, I might be that person that suggests a lemon meringue.</p>
<p id="p-155">Oh no, okay, we can't go for dinner.</p>
<p id="p-156">Yeah, Oh my gosh, but this is true.</p>
<p id="p-157">I mean, I might say to you, Lindsay, oh, I...</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-158">And I might say to you, Lindsay, oh, come on, I know you.</p>
<p id="p-159">You won't skip dessert.</p>
<p id="p-160">Right, So this is just it's saying the same things.</p>
<p id="p-161">It's saying the same three words.</p>
<p id="p-162">I know you.</p>
<p id="p-163">But when you add a little bit of to it, it changes the meaning.</p>
<p id="p-164">Yes, Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-165">And the first one, let's just go back to that first example.</p>
<p id="p-166">I know you.</p>
<p id="p-167">I can't believe we're running into each other here.</p>
<p id="p-168">It's just it's it's what you would say.</p>
<p id="p-169">It's what you would say when you like the friend that I want to become friends with.</p>
<p id="p-170">I realized he was in the run group and he ran past me as we were going to the brewery.</p>
<p id="p-171">Like I know you.</p>
<p id="p-172">Right, You could say that.</p>
<p id="p-173">You're here.</p>
<p id="p-174">I didn't know you were in this run group.</p>
<p id="p-175">Right, So that kind of thing.</p>
<p id="p-176">So they both mean the same thing.</p>
<p id="p-177">But there are essentially different ways to use this phrase.</p>
<p id="p-178">I know you.</p>
<p id="p-179">But exactly.</p>
<p id="p-180">Now, Michelle, we're going to move on to something more into Taylor Swift's version.</p>
<p id="p-181">Yeah, I'm just joking.</p>
<p id="p-182">Now let's talk about I know you all too well.</p>
<p id="p-183">So to know something or someone all too well.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-184">or someone all too well is to really know it, to really be very familiar with that person or the situation.</p>
<p id="p-185">And interestingly enough, the listener asked about sarcasm.</p>
<p id="p-186">It can have a hint of sarcasm too, depending on the context, and we'll share different examples of course.</p>
<p id="p-187">But it can also just mean you really know something.</p>
<p id="p-188">What's different about this is there's a little bit of extra subtext to it.</p>
<p id="p-189">There's a little bit more beneath the surface.</p>
<p id="p-190">Uh-huh, right.</p>
<p id="p-191">It's a little loaded, a little more loaded, let's say, right?</p>
<p id="p-192">Yeah, So what's an example?</p>
<p id="p-193">Yeah, So I know the traffic in this area all too well, right?</p>
<p id="p-194">So what are we saying?</p>
<p id="p-195">Just on the surface, what do we think we're saying as opposed to I know the traffic in this area?</p>
<p id="p-196">Right, So you have experience with the traffic, you know that it's bad, you're very familiar with it.</p>
<p id="p-197">You have some feeling.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-198">with it, you have some feeling about it.</p>
<p id="p-199">Yeah, I mean, that's the key.</p>
<p id="p-200">I think that's really what it is, is it's probably bad and you know that.</p>
<p id="p-201">You have that insight.</p>
<p id="p-202">So I don't think you would say this if the traffic is very light and it's very easy, right?</p>
<p id="p-203">No.</p>
<p id="p-204">It's usually implying something's on the negative side, don't you think?</p>
<p id="p-205">Yes, Yes, Yes, Actually, you're right.</p>
<p id="p-206">In the next example, we have the same thing.</p>
<p id="p-207">So let's share it.</p>
<p id="p-208">So, hmm, are you considering promoting Hillary?</p>
<p id="p-209">Yeah, I know her all too well.</p>
<p id="p-210">I'd reconsider.</p>
<p id="p-211">Oh, right.</p>
<p id="p-212">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-213">So you're saying there's something wrong with Hillary here and it's not the right move to promote her.</p>
<p id="p-214">Maybe promote someone else, right?</p>
<p id="p-215">Yeah, So it does have a subtext and undertone of this thing is kind of negative.</p>
<p id="p-216">And I understand that more than most people do, maybe, right?</p>
<p id="p-217">I have a special view of it or insight into it.</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-218">view of it or insight into it, right?</p>
<p id="p-219">So, I mean, what do you think about the sarcasm question?</p>
<p id="p-220">It's not necessarily Sarcastic, it's more Mmm, what do you think?</p>
<p id="p-221">Well, I think it I think it might qualify as a form of sarcasm It's right.</p>
<p id="p-222">Yeah, I think it falls into the ballpark of Sarcasm in a way We have to use baseball idioms, you know Yeah, I do think I think I think it's there's a lot of different ways to use sarcasm.</p>
<p id="p-223">So You know on the surface maybe that people might think that sounds positive But it's being a little negative a little cynical the way we're saying it, right?</p>
<p id="p-224">Let's give a few more examples here.</p>
<p id="p-225">Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-226">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-227">I know you all too.</p>
<p id="p-228">Well, you definitely need to leave 20 minutes early.</p>
<p id="p-229">Okay So you could have also said I know you right, right?</p>
<p id="p-230">I think that those are Those are very similar if you if you just do that, I know you and really punch the no, it's almost the same</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-231">the no, it's almost the same.</p>
<p id="p-232">Oh, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-233">I would say it's almost interchangeable.</p>
<p id="p-234">Maybe all too well is just a little bit more sounds.</p>
<p id="p-235">What would you say?</p>
<p id="p-236">A little it adds a little negativity to it.</p>
<p id="p-237">I think I think I know you all too well.</p>
<p id="p-238">Right, right.</p>
<p id="p-239">Definitely need to leave.</p>
<p id="p-240">Yeah, I think it just adds an extra layer of cynicism of I know what's gonna happen.</p>
<p id="p-241">I have insight.</p>
<p id="p-242">I understand the traffic.</p>
<p id="p-243">Hillary shouldn't be promoted.</p>
<p id="p-244">Right?</p>
<p id="p-245">Yeah, So yeah.</p>
<p id="p-246">Okay, so again, this can be about a person or a thing, right?</p>
<p id="p-247">So some of our examples like Hillary person, the traffic thing, so you have to read each situation for the subtext, but definitely the expression adds something to the situation, a certain generally negative.</p>
<p id="p-248">Yeah, we're giving our listeners lots of options today to not just say something in a straightforward way, but to add their own.</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-249">way but to add their own sort of emotions or thoughts on to what they're saying.</p>
<p id="p-250">It's pretty cool actually.</p>
<p id="p-251">Yeah, Yeah, Okay, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-252">So there are similar ways to get at the same idea, right?</p>
<p id="p-253">So this one's more straightforward.</p>
<p id="p-254">I'm very familiar with X. Like I know X, right?</p>
<p id="p-255">Right, More than neutral.</p>
<p id="p-256">It's more the neutral version, right?</p>
<p id="p-257">So I'm very familiar with her work.</p>
<p id="p-258">Now depending on how you say it, right?</p>
<p id="p-259">If you say, oh, I'm very familiar with her work, sounds like, yeah, she's probably pretty good.</p>
<p id="p-260">But if you say, I'm very familiar with her work, right?</p>
<p id="p-261">That's where it's hard to realize what's going on.</p>
<p id="p-262">So that's why you can get to the cynicism that exists in all too well by just using tone of voice and understanding subtext of not just what you're saying but what the other person has said, right?</p>
<p id="p-263">So there's always an undertone in conversations.</p>
<p id="p-264">Maybe you're talking about this person's work.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-265">Maybe you're talking about this person's work and everyone thinks it's overrated, right?</p>
<p id="p-266">You're at a gallery.</p>
<p id="p-267">Everyone thinks that work is overrated then.</p>
<p id="p-268">Yeah, this would I yeah I know all of or I'm very familiar with her work, right?</p>
<p id="p-269">Okay What's the next one Lindsay, so I mentioned it just a few seconds ago I know all about X and again You could you could add tone of voice and get to the same impact with this one, too So, for example, I know all about that issue someone starts to tell you I don't know What would be a situation here Michelle with maybe maybe workplace gossip, okay Yeah, I know all about that issue I've tried to fix things but you know Yeah, I was actually thinking that that could totally work workplace gossip I was sorry I was thinking maybe would this be useful in a situation where someone is Mansplaining or woman-splaining something to you and I didn't just say mansplaining I said mansplaining or woman-splaining</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p id="p-270">I said mansplaining or womansplaining.</p>
<p id="p-271">It happens on both genders.</p>
<p id="p-272">We'll have to go into that another day, but it's basically when someone basically talks at you and kind of lectures you about a topic, usually that you know more about than they do, but they just want to assert their dominance.</p>
<p id="p-273">And so I just tell you all about it.</p>
<p id="p-274">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-275">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-276">So funny.</p>
<p id="p-277">So I guess this could be something you could use.</p>
<p id="p-278">Sometimes it's not very helpful in that sort of scenario, but I suppose you could say that.</p>
<p id="p-279">Yeah, I know all about the politics of Africa.</p>
<p id="p-280">I've been studying it my whole life, right?</p>
<p id="p-281">Something like that.</p>
<p id="p-282">Yeah, Right, Or the last one is I'm well aware.</p>
<p id="p-283">Yes, So this one can definitely have an attitude with it.</p>
<p id="p-284">I'm well aware, right?</p>
<p id="p-285">Or even sometimes people might just say, I'm aware.</p>
<p id="p-286">Yes, I'm aware.</p>
<p id="p-287">I'm aware of that.</p>
<p id="p-288">I feel like that's usually if I'm just if somebody is like telling me something that usually it.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p id="p-289">Well, usually my poor dad probably Telling me something he's told me before and I'll just I might just say I'm aware, you know, yeah, it's not as bad though I think with dads.</p>
<p id="p-290">It's just like your dad's just doing his best.</p>
<p id="p-291">Yeah, it's just your dad.</p>
<p id="p-292">So it's okay All right, Michelle roleplay time.</p>
<p id="p-293">Shall we dive into it?</p>
<p id="p-294">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-295">Well use a bunch of these We're not gonna jam everything in here.</p>
<p id="p-296">But yeah, so in this roleplay We are friends.</p>
<p id="p-297">All right, here we go.</p>
<p id="p-298">So we are gonna stop by Teddy's house to pick him up No, no, let me start again start over Okay, so are we gonna stop by Teddy's house to pick him up?</p>
<p id="p-299">Um, honestly the traffic there will be horrible.</p>
<p id="p-300">Can't he just meet us?</p>
<p id="p-301">Oh, I know the traffic here all too well as long as we leave a little early.</p>
<p id="p-302">We'll be fine Lindsay I know you do you think you can get out early?</p>
<p id="p-303">You're always late.</p>
<p id="p-304">I'm well aware</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p id="p-305">you're always late.</p>
<p id="p-306">I'm well aware, but I can do it.</p>
<p id="p-307">Yeah, Okay.</p>
<p id="p-308">This sounds like a conversation that two residents of Los Angeles might have in LA because people don't really leave their neighborhoods that much from what I understand just because the traffic is so wild.</p>
<p id="p-309">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-310">Okay, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-311">So we just used a few of them here.</p>
<p id="p-312">We said, Oh, I know the traffic here all too well.</p>
<p id="p-313">So this does fit what we've said.</p>
<p id="p-314">It's a little cynical.</p>
<p id="p-315">It's a little negative.</p>
<p id="p-316">We know it's going to be bad.</p>
<p id="p-317">And right.</p>
<p id="p-318">So I'm saying, I, yeah, I know it all too well.</p>
<p id="p-319">And I, you're, you're saying like, I know, it's horrible.</p>
<p id="p-320">But I also know that if we leave early, we'll be okay.</p>
<p id="p-321">Right?</p>
<p id="p-322">Yeah, And then you said, Lindsay, I know you.</p>
<p id="p-323">Do you think you can get out early?</p>
<p id="p-324">You're always late.</p>
<p id="p-325">And then maybe you say, I'm well aware, but I can do it.</p>
<p id="p-326">So yeah, maybe you're being a little sassy with I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-327">Yeah, I do think that's</p>
<h2>Part-20</h2>
<p id="p-328">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-329">Yeah, I do think that's a very high level chunk that our listeners, you know, if you just take away, I'm well aware that would be very high level to take out of this episode.</p>
<p id="p-330">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-331">It is a chunk you'll hear native speakers use.</p>
<p id="p-332">And so choose any chunk that you've heard today, guys, and you will level up your English up into getting close to the C1 level.</p>
<p id="p-333">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-334">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-335">Choose your chunk.</p>
<p id="p-336">Choose your chunk.</p>
<p id="p-337">What should be the episode our listeners go to next, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-338">Okay, guys, if you haven't already, go ahead and listen to All Ears English episode 2294 was How to Connect Over Hopes and Wishes in English.</p>
<p id="p-339">Oh, I love it.</p>

<p id="p-345">Michelle, any takeaway for today?</p>
<p id="p-346">Well, this is just it was a really great question.</p>
<p id="p-347">And there's so much that you could do with it.</p>
<p id="p-348">So you want to be</p>
<h2>Part-21</h2>
<p id="p-349">You want to be slightly careful when you're using it about somebody just to make sure you don't offend them.</p>
<p id="p-350">So I would start by maybe until you get comfortable, I personally might start with talking about something rather than someone.</p>
<p id="p-351">Maybe I know the traffic all too well.</p>
<p id="p-352">Oh, I know.</p>
<p id="p-353">I know these train delays all too well might be a good place to start.</p>
<p id="p-354">But if you're feeling comfortable, go for it.</p>
<p id="p-355">Yeah, I actually like that idea, Michelle, to focus, especially in the beginning on just talking about things like traffic or problems or things you might likely encounter.</p>
<p id="p-356">You know, give people a chance to prove you wrong if you have a certain idea of someone and maybe they're going to prove you wrong this time.</p>
<p id="p-357">Try to see them with fresh eyes.</p>
<p id="p-358">I love that idea because people deserve that, you know, even if they've been doing something in a certain way and you know it all too well.</p>
<p id="p-359">Maybe they'll do it differently this time.</p>
<p id="p-360">So let's give them a chance.</p>
<p id="p-361">I love it.</p>
<p id="p-362">And a good way to practice is think.</p>
<h2>Part-22</h2>
<p id="p-363">way to practice is think to yourself after this episode, think for a few minutes, what are some things that you know all too well so that you're prepared to use this in a conversation?</p>
<p id="p-364">Is it something about your neighborhood?</p>
<p id="p-365">Is it something about, you know, prices in a store?</p>
<p id="p-366">Is it something about a restaurant?</p>
<p id="p-367">Whatever it is, make a list of a few things where you could see yourself using this expression.</p>
<p id="p-368">I love that idea, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-369">I mean, that is rooted in applied linguistics.</p>
<p id="p-370">This is actually how we get better in English is we prepare for scenarios.</p>
<p id="p-371">It's called opening your brain box.</p>
<p id="p-372">We tag this over on IELTS Energy Podcast.</p>
<p id="p-373">Open your brain box for this kind of scenario so you'll be ready to insert this phrase when the moment arises.</p>
<p id="p-374">So good.</p>
<p id="p-375">Absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-376">So good.</p>
<p id="p-377">All right.</p>
<p id="p-378">Okay.</p>
<p id="p-379">Well, this was a lot of fun.</p>
<p id="p-380">And thanks to our listener for that really interesting and unique question.</p>
<p id="p-381">All right.</p>
<p id="p-382">Good stuff, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-383">Talk to you soon.</p>
<p id="p-384">Have a good day.</p>
