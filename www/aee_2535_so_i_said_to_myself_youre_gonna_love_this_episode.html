<p>Hello, Michelle.</p>
<p>Are you excited to record with me today?</p>
<p>Oh, yes, Aubrey.</p>
<p>As soon as I found out, I said to myself, this is going to be so fun.</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p>So fun.</p>
<p>So here we go.</p>
<p>Lindsay is out of town this week, so Michelle and I are taking over the mic.</p>
<p>She will be back next week.</p>
<p>Never fear.</p>
<p>But I gave us a little role play here because I wanted you to do this really interesting thing we do in English when we're reporting thoughts, where we'll say, I said to myself or I told myself, and then the thought, right?</p>
<p>Oh, this is great.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it's true.</p>
<p>That is what I said to myself.</p>
<p>So not just a... Yeah, it's all so true.</p>
<p>I had a feeling.</p>
<p>It is true.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love recording with you, Aubrey.</p>
<p>We have a lot of fun.</p>
<p>That was so fun.</p>
<p>Yeah, so today we are going to be sharing tips that will help you use the verbs say and tell when reporting speech.</p>
<p>Yeah, and this adds interest to what you're saying and improves your storytelling because if you're sharing something that happened in the past, if you just say this happened and then this happened and I thought this, it's pretty boring, right?</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p>thought this.</p>
<p>It's pretty boring, right?</p>
<p>But we report speech, we narrate speech and thoughts in order to draw the listener into the story.</p>
<p>And we'll share how we do this in both past tense and present tense to really help the listener feel like they were there with you.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, this is such a fun topic.</p>
<p>So let's get into it.</p>
<p>So what we used in the little role play at the beginning, I said, I said to myself.</p>
<p>Yeah, And when would you say that?</p>
<p>This is a really good example, right?</p>
<p>I said to myself, this is going to be so much fun.</p>
<p>It means the same thing as I thought.</p>
<p>So whenever you're telling someone something you thought, this is a really native, natural way to do it.</p>
<p>I said to myself, it's going to rain.</p>
<p>It could be anything.</p>
<p>Now, does this usually mean that you were actually set it out loud?</p>
<p>That's a really good point.</p>
<p>No, right?</p>
<p>We don't usually talk to ourselves out loud.</p>
<p>This means I thought.</p>
<p>I said to myself, but I didn't literally say.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p>to myself, but I didn't literally say this to him.</p>
<p>Like I just thought it.</p>
<p>It was a thought in my brain that I said to myself.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>So should we do a couple examples?</p>
<p>Yeah, let's do it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So when I found out my mom was visiting, I said to myself, I need to clean my house.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I think you wrote this for me for exactly today because my mom is coming tomorrow.</p>
<p>Oh, that's funny.</p>
<p>And I do need to clean my house.</p>
<p>You said this to yourself this morning.</p>
<p>I said this to myself.</p>
<p>Yes, Well, I've been saying this to myself.</p>
<p>I'm the same, right?</p>
<p>If family's visiting, especially my mom, for some reason, I'm like, oh, boy, need to clean my house, make sure there's no dust on anything.</p>
<p>Yes, I'm sure that's a common experience out there.</p>
<p>Yes, All my mom wants is the, at this point, I think she'll be thrilled if my front hall is cleared.</p>
<p>That's what we were working on last night.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>Clear the front hall.</p>
<p>She'll be happy.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Or maybe here's another example.</p>
<p>He saw that her car wasn't in the driveway.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p>He saw that her car wasn't in the driveway and immediately said to himself, I wonder where she went.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you wouldn't say, this certainly wasn't out loud, or not necessarily out loud.</p>
<p>Most people don't verbally speak out loud to themselves, just probably thought it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I mean, Aubrey, do you use I told myself in the same way, right?</p>
<p>So as soon as I found out, I said to myself, this is going to be so fun.</p>
<p>Could you also say told myself?</p>
<p>Here's what's interesting.</p>
<p>This first was inspired by a student saying that.</p>
<p>I told myself and then sort of reported thoughts like this.</p>
<p>And it sort of sounded wrong to me.</p>
<p>And I was like, oh, you would say I said to myself.</p>
<p>But then I started asking people about it and trying to observe and looking up online.</p>
<p>And everything I could find says told myself has the same meaning and is used this way, but is slightly more formal.</p>
<p>It's not quite as conversational.</p>
<p>And because we use it in a lot of other ways, I told myself has a bunch of other meanings.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p>myself has a bunch of other meanings, that usually if we're just saying I thought, we'll say I said to myself.</p>
<p>But you could say like, I told myself this year would be different.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Or I told myself to stay calm even though the situation was stressful.</p>
<p>These are a little more like I motivated myself.</p>
<p>I was trying to, right?</p>
<p>It's like a pep talk you give yourself.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I was thinking pep talk too.</p>
<p>Yeah, pep talk or some sort of advice or yeah.</p>
<p>Or I told myself I deserved a break, so I took the afternoon off.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>But I ran this by a few people because I'm wondering like, is this different in different English-speaking countries or different regions of the US?</p>
<p>So I asked a few English speakers from other countries as well.</p>
<p>And most of them were like, oh, I would definitely say like, oh, I found out I was recording with Michelle.</p>
<p>So I told myself, this is going to be so fun.</p>
<p>Didn't sound strange to them.</p>
<p>So it's interesting.</p>
<p>I think this kind of depends on what you grew up hearing, what your parents said.</p>
<p>And mine would have been more likely to say, I said to myself.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p>say I said to myself.</p>
<p>I also might say, oh, I was like, right?</p>
<p>And we did an episode about those.</p>
<p>We're going to share this.</p>
<p>So stay to the end.</p>
<p>We're going to share when we taught.</p>
<p>I was all, I was like, a lot of these more informal ways that we narrate speech.</p>
<p>So stay to the end if you missed it.</p>
<p>Those are even more common, I think.</p>
<p>And then also I said to myself.</p>
<p>But let's dive into some of these other meanings for told myself.</p>
<p>I think these are really interesting.</p>
<p>We use it first for like encouragement, self-correction, or maybe a promise to yourself when you're mentally committing to do something, right?</p>
<p>So for example, before the presentation, I told myself, don't panic.</p>
<p>And you could say I said to myself, right?</p>
<p>Both of them would work here.</p>
<p>Right, Or I told myself I would wake up earlier this year.</p>
<p>Ha ha, that sounds like me.</p>
<p>I don't sing a deadline.</p>
<p>I told myself I needed to be more organized.</p>
<p>Often this is with those</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p>Often this is with those resolutions, right?</p>
<p>Maybe you told yourself you'd start waking up earlier.</p>
<p>Someone else decided to get more organized and we might use this chunk.</p>
<p>I told myself this was going to happen this year.</p>
<p>Yeah, or also then there's another way of regret or hindsight.</p>
<p>So this is used when you look back and you wish you had listened to your inner voice.</p>
<p>Yeah, like I told myself not to trust him, but I ignored it.</p>
<p>And then you're regretting like, whoops, something happened.</p>
<p>I should not have trusted him.</p>
<p>Or I told myself to double check and I should have.</p>
<p>So I didn't double check.</p>
<p>This happened to me recently.</p>
<p>I left water boiling on the stove and I told myself to double check.</p>
<p>I had to call one of my kids and be like, turn off the stove.</p>
<p>I think I left water boiling.</p>
<p>Oh, gosh.</p>
<p>Oh, no, Aubrey.</p>
<p>But it happens to everyone.</p>
<p>Or habitual thinking about the past.</p>
<p>So like talking about something you used to repeatedly tell yourself.</p>
<p>For example, for years, I told myself I didn't have time to learn a new language.</p>
<p>And then I realized</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p>time to learn a new language.</p>
<p>And then I realized I needed to prioritize it.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Or I told myself I didn't need help.</p>
<p>Then I realized I couldn't do it alone.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you're kind of sharing what this inner voice is, what you were repeatedly saying to yourself or repeatedly thinking, right?</p>
<p>I thought this a lot is what this means.</p>
<p>I told myself I didn't need help means I often thought this or this was my mindset in general.</p>
<p>Yeah, And now we were also talking about, Aubrey, you mentioned kind of the tenses, right?</p>
<p>So we've been talking about I told myself, I said to myself.</p>
<p>But what about I say to myself?</p>
<p>Yes, we definitely use this for habitual thinking, right?</p>
<p>Every day I say to myself, I'm going to exercise today and then it never happens, right?</p>
<p>So this is more like I think this every day.</p>
<p>Every day I say to myself.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>We also use present simple to bring someone into a story, right?</p>
<p>To make it feel like they were right there with us.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>And we've talked about that a lot.</p>
<p>You know, that's a...</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p>about that a lot.</p>
<p>That's a very common strategy.</p>
<p>So this is how it would look like with say.</p>
<p>So this guy was yelling at everyone.</p>
<p>So I say to myself, stay calm, it's going to be fine.</p>
<p>Yeah, and we often do this where we start the sentence in past tense, right?</p>
<p>He was yelling at everyone.</p>
<p>And then as we start narrating what we thought, we move to present tense to pull the listener in as if they were there with us.</p>
<p>I say to myself, stay calm.</p>
<p>It is, right?</p>
<p>I love these layers of English when these are things that you can uncover.</p>
<p>And even for native speakers, I mean, when you hear these things, you're like, oh, you know, I didn't realize I do that.</p>
<p>Or why do I do that?</p>
<p>These are some of my favorite things about learning about our own language.</p>
<p>When storytellers do this, I notice and I do feel like I was right there with them, right?</p>
<p>Yes, Yeah, Or here's another example.</p>
<p>Everyone was running every which way and I say to myself, what is going on here?</p>
<p>I also like that bonus, every which way.</p>
<p>Yeah, every</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p>every which way.</p>
<p>Yeah, every which way, meaning in all directions.</p>
<p>That is fun.</p>
<p>And then you notice she switched from everyone was running, past tense, she's describing something that happened in the past, and then switches to present to bring them there, like bring you from the past into the present.</p>
<p>And I say to myself, what is going on here?</p>
<p>And then you might stay present tense, be like, and then this person is screaming, and there are sirens blaring.</p>
<p>You might stay in present tense to make it feel more exciting and engaging.</p>
<p>Definitely love it.</p>

<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p>今が一番かっこいいあなたに。詳しくは味覚糖オートファジーで検索。ミシェル、ロールプレイしましょう。あなたと私は友達で、このロールプレイでランチに会うんです。私が始めます。こんにちは、遅れてしまいました。今日は早く家を出ると決めたのですが、ここにいます。大丈夫です。正直言って、歩いているときに、また交通渋滞にはまっているんだろうなと言いました。正確です。最近は毎朝、自分に、今日は時間通りに着くぞと言い聞かせていますが、まだうまくいっていません。人生の物語です。自分に、もうコーヒーは買わないと決めましたが、カフェを通り過ぎた瞬間に、自分に、まあ、一杯ぐらいなら大丈夫だろうと思いました。とてもリアルです。昨夜、銀行アプリを開いて、自分に、これで終わりにしないとと思いました。このロールプレイはとてもリアルで、とても楽しいです。本当にそうです。言う、言われた、言ったを使う必要があることがわかります。</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p>and told because we will use it multiple times like this in a conversation.</p>
<p>You wouldn't want to say the exact same chunk over and over.</p>
<p>I said to myself, I said every, right, exactly.</p>
<p>So let's go through it.</p>
<p>So you said, hey, sorry, I'm late.</p>
<p>I told myself I'd leave the house earlier today, but here we are.</p>
<p>So I thought this, right?</p>
<p>Yesterday I thought, I'm gonna leave on time, I'm gonna get there on time.</p>
<p>And that's another way to say it.</p>
<p>I told myself I'd leave the house earlier.</p>
<p>And then you said, fine, honestly, on the walk over, I said to myself, she's probably stuck in traffic again.</p>
<p>So again, you just thought, and you could say I thought.</p>
<p>On the way over, I thought, I bet she's gonna be stuck in traffic again.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>Something that's happened to me a lot, evidently.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>And then you said, and every morning lately, I say to myself, today I'm gonna be on time.</p>
<p>Okay, so yeah, you think to yourself, you're thinking of it.</p>
<p>Exactly, habitual actions.</p>
<p>We would use present tense, right?</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p>This we would use present tense, right?</p>
<p>This happens every morning.</p>
<p>And if you were going to use past tense, you'd need the present perfect.</p>
<p>Every morning I have said to myself, I'm going to be on time because this is something that's going to happen again, right?</p>
<p>Or you can use present tense like this.</p>
<p>This is habitual.</p>
<p>It's always true.</p>
<p>I always say to myself, today I'm going to be on time and then it never happens.</p>
<p>Yeah, that happens to me.</p>
<p>It happens to the best of us.</p>
<p>Anyone with kids, that's our excuse.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>You know, I feel like there's like mom time, you know, especially when you're, if I'm trying to get together with friends for a play date, it could just, it could be on time, but it could also be a half an hour later.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>There's no, and there's just kind of this code where the parents understand, you know, it's, it's, I think it's different from any other social interaction.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>We make it, need to make it more like appliance repair where we say like, I'll be there between noon and four.</p>
<p>And then I'll text you when I have a closer ETA.</p>
<p>That's hilarious.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p>have a closer ETA.</p>
<p>That's hilarious.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>Or furniture delivery.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That's more realistic for a mom, really.</p>
<p>True, true.</p>
<p>So then you said, story of my life, I told myself I wouldn't buy any more coffee.</p>
<p>So you had had this thought, I need to stop buying coffee out.</p>
<p>I need to make it at home to save some money.</p>
<p>But then as soon as you passed a cafe, I said to myself, well, one cup won't hurt.</p>
<p>And this is when I use it the most often.</p>
<p>Yes, this is for all of us.</p>
<p>Best laid plans.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it could be anything.</p>
<p>Or like I told myself I would eat less sugar.</p>
<p>I told myself that I would eat healthy because I have a wedding coming up.</p>
<p>But I passed a cookie shop.</p>
<p>I said to myself, that's fine.</p>
<p>And this is where we wouldn't just use I thought.</p>
<p>We wouldn't say like, I thought I wouldn't eat any more cookies.</p>
<p>No, we're using this other meaning of I told myself or I said to myself of like setting a goal, motivating yourself, trying to like commit to something.</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<h2>Part-17</h2>
<p>Right, right, right, exactly.</p>
<p>And then you said that's so real.</p>
<p>When I opened my bank app last night, I literally said to myself, okay, this needs to stop.</p>
<p>Yeah, and this is interesting to use literally.</p>
<p>We've talked about this before.</p>
<p>Literally is interesting in the English language.</p>
<p>I could mean that I literally said out loud, okay, this needs to stop.</p>
<p>But it also could mean that I just thought that and I'm just using literally to try and emphasize.</p>
<p>Right, yeah.</p>
<p>And also I want to make one more interesting point about this is kind of how our voice changes when we get to the thought, when we get to the thing we're saying.</p>
<p>Because you don't say, I literally said to myself, okay, this needs to stop.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>It's kind of, you kind of put on a voice in a little way, right?</p>
<p>I literally said to myself, okay, this needs to stop, right?</p>
<p>You have to have a little feeling with it.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I don't think that it's going to be as interesting.</p>
<p>And here we're storytelling, right?</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>We're narrating our thoughts and we do change our tone, our pitch.</p>
<h2>Part-18</h2>
<p>do change our tone, our pitch to make it interesting.</p>
<p>It would be strange to say any of this in a monotone.</p>
<p>That's one of the best things about these role plays is our voices sort of take on the tone of how we would actually use it in a conversation.</p>
<p>Right, and I even go back to the one before.</p>
<p>I told myself I wouldn't buy any more coffee.</p>
<p>So here, you're not really, it's not really a piece of dialogue, right?</p>
<p>I've told myself I want to do this.</p>
<p>And then the second I passed a cafe, I said to myself, well, one cup won't hurt, right?</p>
<p>You're not going to say, I said to myself, well, one cup won't hurt.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>You're going to pause.</p>
<p>You're going to change the tone.</p>
<p>We would write it in quotes, even though we didn't say it.</p>
<p>It's a thought that's sort of being expressed as dialogue.</p>
<p>And we really change our voice for that to make it more interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>Well, if you want to hear more about how to be a good storyteller, check out episode 2401 of All There's English.</p>
<p>And that was how to be a more interesting storyteller.</p>
<h2>Part-19</h2>
<p>interesting storyteller.</p>
<p>Yes, that was reporting speech with I was all I was like very casual great for stories for conversations.</p>
<p>And if you missed that episode, be sure to hit follow right here on All Ears English because you are missing great episodes.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>We come out with a lot of episodes.</p>
<p>Make it easy on yourself.</p>
<p>Let the episodes just come right into your queue.</p>
<p>So, Aubrey, takeaways for today.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, definitely reporting thoughts, you know, makes you a better storyteller, makes conversation more interesting.</p>
<p>Think about this using present tense to bring someone into the story and then use and also what a connection skill to share what you're committing to do.</p>
<p>I told myself I would do that, especially if you then don't do it.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I love this.</p>
<p>I think this bonds you to someone when you share what you committed to and then didn't follow through.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Aubrey, this is a really fun</p>
