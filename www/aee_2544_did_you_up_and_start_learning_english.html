<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-22">B-U-S-I-N-E-S-S. Hello, Michelle.</p>
<p id="p-23">How are you today?</p>
<p id="p-24">I'm good, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-25">How are you?</p>
<p id="p-26">I'm excited to record with you.</p>
<p id="p-27">Yes, this is going to be so fun.</p>
<p id="p-28">And I have a question to start out.</p>
<p id="p-29">I'm very curious about your answer here.</p>
<p id="p-30">Have you ever up and quit a job without giving notice?</p>
<p id="p-31">Oh, no.</p>
<p id="p-32">No, okay.</p>
<p id="p-33">I have never done that.</p>
<p id="p-34">I mean, I have left jobs, but it's always with like a two-week notice.</p>
<p id="p-35">What about you?</p>
<p id="p-36">I did this once.</p>
<p id="p-37">I was very young.</p>
<p id="p-38">I was working in a spook alley in my hometown.</p>
<p id="p-39">And I don't remember details, but I remember feeling like the person, sort of the manager, was being inappropriate.</p>
<p id="p-40">Whatever, they were either saying things or whatever it was, and I complained to my parents.</p>
<p id="p-41">And I was uncomfortable.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-42">parents, and I was uncomfortable saying something to them, so I just never went back.</p>
<p id="p-43">I just up and quit.</p>
<p id="p-44">Never went in again.</p>
<p id="p-45">Didn't want to see them ever again.</p>
<p id="p-46">What is a spook alley?</p>
<p id="p-47">Oh, like a haunted house.</p>
<p id="p-48">Oh, that's funny.</p>
<p id="p-49">We call it a spook alley in Idaho, but like a haunted house.</p>
<p id="p-50">Oh, that's funny.</p>
<p id="p-51">Yeah, I never heard it called that.</p>
<p id="p-52">Very interesting.</p>
<p id="p-53">Well, it's kind of a small local one.</p>
<p id="p-54">There are like those big expensive ones.</p>
<p id="p-55">This wasn't that.</p>
<p id="p-56">This was a very small town.</p>
<p id="p-57">I'm imagining an actual alley.</p>
<p id="p-58">Is that how it's? No, it's the same as a haunted house where it's some kind of building and it's all you go through and I was one of the scarers.</p>
<p id="p-59">Like people come through and I would jump out and scare them.</p>
<p id="p-60">But it wasn't in an alley.</p>
<p id="p-61">I don't know why they call it a spook alley.</p>
<p id="p-62">That's always what we call it.</p>
<p id="p-63">Well, good to know.</p>
<p id="p-64">But yeah, it's good that you left, especially under those circumstances.</p>
<p id="p-65">Yes, I agree.</p>
<p id="p-66">But the reason I asked, we're talking about this interesting phrase to say you up and did something.</p>
<p id="p-67">This was inspired by</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-68">This was inspired by, in a recent role play, Lindsay said, I up and moved to Japan without even considering.</p>
<p id="p-69">And she didn't really do that.</p>
<p id="p-70">She considered first, but it was something in the role play and it made me realize, ooh, this is an interesting phrase.</p>
<p id="p-71">And there are quite a few ways that we say this.</p>
<p id="p-72">So we're going to cover those today.</p>
<p id="p-73">Awesome.</p>
<p id="p-74">Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-75">This is very common.</p>
<p id="p-76">Yes, But guys, be sure to hit follow wherever you listen to the All Ears English podcast.</p>

<p id="p-80">It is upend, right?</p>
<p id="p-81">To up and do something.</p>
<p id="p-82">What does that mean?</p>
<p id="p-83">Yeah, it just means to do something pretty suddenly, right?</p>
<p id="p-84">Exactly, right?</p>
<p id="p-85">Spontaneously, without notice, without thinking about it ahead of time, usually.</p>
<p id="p-86">For example, he up and moved to Chicago because he felt like he needed a change.</p>
<p id="p-87">That would mean he was not thinking about it a long time and making this decision.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-88">about it a long time and making this decision, he sort of did it out of the blue.</p>
<p id="p-89">Or she up and decided to adopt a puppy and came home with one that same day.</p>
<p id="p-90">Well, that sounds delightful.</p>
<p id="p-91">Right?</p>
<p id="p-92">My kids would love that if I up and decided to adopt a puppy and came home with one.</p>
<p id="p-93">I'm not that spontaneous.</p>
<p id="p-94">Are you, Michelle?</p>
<p id="p-95">Is this something you would up and do?</p>
<p id="p-96">I don't think so.</p>
<p id="p-97">Not at this stage in my life.</p>
<p id="p-98">You're more of a planner.</p>
<p id="p-99">It is possible that if all the circumstances were lined up and I was out and there was one and I knew my kids wanted it and I just thought it was so cute and I thought, okay, this is the right time anyway, then I would do it.</p>
<p id="p-100">But not... It could happen.</p>
<p id="p-101">Maybe.</p>
<p id="p-102">It could.</p>
<p id="p-103">I mean, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-104">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-105">It depends how cute the puppy is.</p>
<p id="p-106">Right, It'd have to be really cute.</p>
<p id="p-107">All right.</p>
<p id="p-108">Our second one is all of a sudden.</p>
<p id="p-109">This is more common.</p>
<p id="p-110">Up and like that is a little less...</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-111">Up and like that is a little less common.</p>
<p id="p-112">It is interesting, people will know what you mean, but I don't hear it quite as often.</p>
<p id="p-113">Whereas some of these others we hear a lot, like all of a sudden she jumped out of the car.</p>
<p id="p-114">You could say she up and jumped out of the car.</p>
<p id="p-115">It means the same thing, did it without thinking about it spontaneously.</p>
<p id="p-116">But all of a sudden is more common.</p>
<p id="p-117">Right, Or here's another one.</p>
<p id="p-118">It felt like they just met and they were engaged all of a sudden.</p>
<p id="p-119">Do you know anyone who got engaged very quickly after meeting?</p>
<p id="p-120">Yeah, me.</p>
<p id="p-121">You?</p>
<p id="p-122">I thought you.</p>
<p id="p-123">But I couldn't remember quite.</p>
<p id="p-124">Yes, Yeah, we had only known each other three months and I did have quite a few friends that same, like met, didn't know each other that long and then all of a sudden engaged.</p>
<p id="p-125">All of a sudden, you never know.</p>
<p id="p-126">All right.</p>
<p id="p-127">Our next one is out of nowhere.</p>
<p id="p-128">This is similar to that idiom I used out of the blue.</p>
<p id="p-129">You might say he seemed to decide out of nowhere to leave.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-130">to decide out of nowhere to leave the party.</p>
<p id="p-131">So it was unexpected, right?</p>
<p id="p-132">Seems like he's having a great time and then out of nowhere leaves.</p>
<p id="p-133">Right, right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-134">Or we thought she'd go to a local university, but out of nowhere she got a scholarship to UCLA.</p>
<p id="p-135">Yeah, I guess that could happen when your kids are deciding where to go to school.</p>
<p id="p-136">Maybe you think, oh, they're going to stay close to home and then something happens.</p>
<p id="p-137">Yeah, if they get a scholarship to a good school out of state, out of nowhere, they could end up going kind of far.</p>
<p id="p-138">Aw.</p>
<p id="p-139">It happens.</p>
<p id="p-140">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-141">And then here's the next one.</p>
<p id="p-142">The next one is just like that, which makes me think of, isn't that Sex and the City reboot called and just like that?</p>
<p id="p-143">Yeah, I think it is called and just like that.</p>
<p id="p-144">And this is sort of trendy to be like, and just like that, just like that, this happened.</p>
<p id="p-145">You'll hear this one a lot.</p>
<p id="p-146">So just like that, he decided not to go out.</p>
<p id="p-147">So maybe he was planning to.</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-148">So maybe he was planning to and then he just kind of changed his mind, just like that.</p>
<p id="p-149">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-150">Out of nowhere, right?</p>
<p id="p-151">These all are very similar.</p>
<p id="p-152">Or she quit her job and moved to Washington just like that.</p>
<p id="p-153">It was unexpected.</p>
<p id="p-154">You didn't know it was happening.</p>
<p id="p-155">And sometimes someone is planning, but they're not sharing their plans with you.</p>
<p id="p-156">So to you, it seems like it happened just like that.</p>
<p id="p-157">That's true.</p>
<p id="p-158">It could be that.</p>
<p id="p-159">And we're going to do one more, guys.</p>
<p id="p-160">So this one is on a whim.</p>
<p id="p-161">So also, this one is very spontaneous.</p>
<p id="p-162">So she booked a flight to Mexico on a whim after seeing a photo of the beach.</p>
<p id="p-163">So yeah, she saw a photo of the beach and she's like, you know what?</p>
<p id="p-164">I'm ready to go.</p>
<p id="p-165">I'm booking it right now.</p>
<p id="p-166">Yeah, Have you ever done something like that with a trip?</p>
<p id="p-167">Yeah, I have gone on trips pretty spontaneously.</p>
<p id="p-168">I remember when we did a cruise, we were at a friend's home and we were like, wouldn't it be fun if we did a cruise over New Year's Eve?</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-169">We did a cruise over New Year's Eve and just on a whim, we looked up availability and pricing and booked it right then to go both of our families together.</p>
<p id="p-170">So yeah, it's kind of fun to do something on a whim like that.</p>
<p id="p-171">Yeah, I've done it.</p>
<p id="p-172">I haven't done like a larger trip like that, but will sometimes with the kids just be like, oh, we're just going to do a night in the city or we went to Atlantic City and we found a cheap hotel.</p>
<p id="p-173">Yeah, quick weekend, a road trip.</p>
<p id="p-174">A lot of those things you can do on a whim because it's not as much planning.</p>
<p id="p-175">Right, And yeah, that stuff we'll do every once in a while or we always want to.</p>
<p id="p-176">And then we're like, should we spend the money on this?</p>
<p id="p-177">Probably not.</p>
<p id="p-178">That happens too, right?</p>
<p id="p-179">You decide on a whim to do something and then talk yourselves out of it.</p>
<p id="p-180">The reason.</p>
<p id="p-181">Yes, The idea is very good, but yes.</p>
<p id="p-182">Or what's another example?</p>
<p id="p-183">We decided to adopt the cat on a whim, even though we only went to the shelter to volunteer.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-184">to the shelter to volunteer.</p>
<p id="p-185">So it's a lot of examples about getting pets, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-186">I know my kids would love a pet, but there are a lot of allergies to animals in our home, so probably not going to do it, but my kids would love this.</p>
<p id="p-187">Are you allergic to any animals?</p>
<p id="p-188">I'm not.</p>
<p id="p-189">I'm not.</p>
<p id="p-190">My husband and my daughter are allergic to cats.</p>
<p id="p-191">I'm allergic to cats.</p>
<p id="p-192">Yeah, unfortunately, because, but we do have a lot of neighbors that have cats and dogs that we can go and snuggle them whenever we want.</p>
<p id="p-193">That's good.</p>
<p id="p-194">That's good.</p>
<p id="p-195">All right, Michelle, let's do a role play to show all of these in a conversation.</p>
<p id="p-196">I am telling you about my weekend here.</p>
<p id="p-197">I'll start us out.</p>
<p id="p-198">All right.</p>
<p id="p-199">We were planning on a quiet weekend at home, but then up and bought concert tickets Saturday night.</p>
<p id="p-200">Oh, wow.</p>
<p id="p-201">Super last minute?</p>
<p id="p-202">Yeah, we were at dinner and all of a sudden my husband goes, let's see if the Glass Animal Show isn't sold out.</p>
<p id="p-203">And there were tickets.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-204">And there were tickets?</p>
<p id="p-205">That's crazy.</p>
<p id="p-206">I know.</p>
<p id="p-207">We had thought about going but never got tickets.</p>
<p id="p-208">Then, out of nowhere, he pulls out his phone and checks.</p>
<p id="p-209">Two tickets, decent seats.</p>
<p id="p-210">And he bought them, just like that.</p>
<p id="p-211">Wow, totally unplanned?</p>
<p id="p-212">Yeah, we never do stuff on a whim like that, but it was really fun.</p>
<p id="p-213">I'm sad this isn't true life because I love the Glass Animals.</p>
<p id="p-214">I'm not really a huge concert person, but I'd like to go to the Glass Animals.</p>
<p id="p-215">I don't know the Glass Animals.</p>
<p id="p-216">Ooh, look it up after this episode.</p>
<p id="p-217">Everyone out there listening, look up the Glass Animals.</p>
<p id="p-218">It's such a vibe.</p>
<p id="p-219">It's really good music.</p>
<p id="p-220">Cool.</p>
<p id="p-221">Okay, I will.</p>
<p id="p-222">Nice.</p>
<p id="p-223">All right, so let's go through this.</p>
<p id="p-224">Which did we use first?</p>
<p id="p-225">So you said, we were planning on a quiet weekend at home, but then up and bought concert tickets Saturday night.</p>
<p id="p-226">So suddenly we did it without planning.</p>
<p id="p-227">So I just want to point out something about this because the pronunciation.</p>
<p id="p-228">So it might sound like up end, right?</p>
<p id="p-229">But it's actually</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-230">Right, but it's actually up and, up and, and.</p>
<p id="p-231">Right, two words, U-P-A-N-D. That's true because upend, one word, U-P-E-N-D, is a verb, and they do sound a lot alike in conversation.</p>
<p id="p-232">Right, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-233">So you have to listen for the context.</p>
<p id="p-234">And yeah, because we're speaking kind of fast and the way it might come out, it sounds like upend.</p>
<p id="p-235">And you do have to say this pretty quickly.</p>
<p id="p-236">It would sound strange to say, but then up and bought concert tickets.</p>
<p id="p-237">We kind of run it all together.</p>
<p id="p-238">But then up and bought concert tickets.</p>
<p id="p-239">Yeah, sounds like one word.</p>
<p id="p-240">Yeah, it would.</p>
<p id="p-241">So I said, oh wow, super last minute.</p>
<p id="p-242">And then you told me more.</p>
<p id="p-243">What did you say?</p>
<p id="p-244">I said we were at dinner and all of a sudden my husband goes, let's see if this concert isn't sold out.</p>
<p id="p-245">So yeah, again, just means like out of the blue, unexpectedly.</p>
<p id="p-246">And then you said we had thought about going.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-247">And then you said, we had thought about going but never got tickets.</p>
<p id="p-248">Then out of nowhere, he pulls out his phone and checked.</p>
<p id="p-249">I'm going to continue because I'm not going to say something in a second.</p>
<p id="p-250">Two tickets, decent seats, and he bought them just like that.</p>
<p id="p-251">So Aubrey, this made me think of what word is, let's see if you know what I'm thinking of, what got kind of, ooh, this word I remember because of Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-252">No, I'm not sure what you mean.</p>
<p id="p-253">Decent, we did an episode on the word decent, remember?</p>
<p id="p-254">That's right.</p>
<p id="p-255">That was a great episode.</p>
<p id="p-256">We got decent seats.</p>
<p id="p-257">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-258">I should have thought of that.</p>
<p id="p-259">That's true.</p>
<p id="p-260">I was like, oh, the word decent, we talked about that.</p>
<p id="p-261">Yeah, so anyway, out of nowhere and just like that, same idea, unplanned.</p>
<p id="p-262">Yep, and then I say, we never do stuff on a whim like that, but it was really fun.</p>
<p id="p-263">It just means we're usually not that spontaneous to do something without planning it.</p>
<p id="p-264">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p id="p-265">So yeah, these are all...</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-266">So yeah, these are all really useful, guys.</p>
<p id="p-267">If you haven't already, check out, and if you're studying for IELTS, we have episode 1532 of the IELTS Energy podcast that is Use IELTS Vocabulary at the Drop of a Hat.</p>
<p id="p-268">Yes, and this was related vocabulary, in a heartbeat, in the blink of an eye, without a second thought, some interesting idioms that have a similar meaning.</p>
<p id="p-269">So if you're not following IELTS Energy, amazing vocabulary over there as well, whether or not you're studying for the IELTS exam.</p>
<p id="p-270">So definitely check it out.</p>
<p id="p-271">Okay, awesome.</p>
<p id="p-272">All right, Aubrey, well, I guess I'm, no, that doesn't work.</p>
<p id="p-273">I was trying to use one of the expressions, but I couldn't. I was trying to use one of them on a whim, but I couldn't do it.</p>
<p id="p-274">Anyway.</p>
<p id="p-275">We are kind of recording today on a whim.</p>
<p id="p-276">We weren't planning on recording, and then it turned out our schedules matched up.</p>
<p id="p-277">So out of nowhere, all of a sudden, we get to record together.</p>
<p id="p-278">All of a sudden, all of a sudden.</p>
<p id="p-279">And so we up and got our recording equipment out, and here we are.</p>
<p id="p-280">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-281">This is such a great</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-282">Exactly, this is such great vocab for connecting because it's interesting when something happens spontaneously like this, you want to share that with friends, right?</p>
<p id="p-283">And if they do something out of the blue, out of nowhere, then it would be fun to respond like, wow, on a whim, right?</p>
<p id="p-284">Asking like if they're usually that spontaneous.</p>
<p id="p-285">Yep.</p>
<p id="p-286">All right, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-287">Well, this was fun and I will see you on the next episode.</p>
<p id="p-288">Awesome.</p>
<p id="p-289">See you next time.</p>
