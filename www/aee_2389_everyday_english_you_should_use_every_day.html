<p id="p-17">Lindsay, I have a question for you.</p>
<p id="p-18">Okay, go ahead.</p>
<p id="p-19">What's the question?</p>
<h2>Part-03</h2>
<p id="p-20">Okay, go ahead.</p>
<p id="p-21">What's the question?</p>
<p id="p-22">What is something you do every day?</p>
<p id="p-23">Every day, I take my dog for a walk because he needs to get out.</p>
<p id="p-24">He needs the exercise and I need the exercise as well.</p>
<p id="p-25">You do that every single day?</p>
<p id="p-26">Basically, yes.</p>
<p id="p-27">Every single day.</p>
<p id="p-28">He needs to be out.</p>
<p id="p-29">It's quite a commitment having a dog.</p>
<p id="p-30">We are answering a really interesting question about this, the difference between every single day and every day and also every day we use two different ways.</p>
<p id="p-31">I'm excited to dive into this today.</p>
<p id="p-32">Yeah, What about you, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-33">What is something in your daily routine that you do every day?</p>
<p id="p-34">I wake my kids up for either school or sports every single day.</p>
<p id="p-35">School days, we're waking them up.</p>
<p id="p-36">Saturdays and Sundays, they have sports early in the morning always.</p>
<p id="p-37">Every morning, we're waking up early.</p>
<p id="p-38">Soon they have to get their own alarm clocks.</p>
<p id="p-39">I know, right?</p>
<p id="p-40">I like to wake them up with a snuggle and they're grumpy if they don't get a little snuggle in the morning.</p>
<h2>Part-04</h2>
<p id="p-41">Don't get like a little snuggle in the morning.</p>
<p id="p-42">So until they won't let me snuggle them anymore, I wake them up with a little morning snuggle.</p>
<p id="p-43">I love that.</p>
<p id="p-44">We're getting into a great, I feel like a lot of students have this question.</p>
<p id="p-45">Today's episode is inspired by a question, but before we really get into the details here, Aubrey, we have an important announcement about something coming very, very soon and something our listeners should do right now to be on top.</p>
<p id="p-46">Yes, So we are excited about this is our new course, Professional Level 1. We interviewed seven native speakers from all different parts of the country, one person from the UK.</p>
<p id="p-47">So you are hearing real professional English and you're also getting amazing business advice.</p>
<p id="p-48">Yeah, these are successful native speaking professionals who are at the top of their game, the top of their industries, people that work with executives, people that work in technology, project managers, people that are in positions where many of our listeners are currently or want to be.</p>
<p id="p-49">And that's who we should be listening to and learning from.</p>
<h2>Part-05</h2>
<p id="p-50">to and learning from, and that is the foundation of this course.</p>
<p id="p-51">But there's so much more too.</p>
<p id="p-52">We'll be going into tactics for meetings, tactics, grammar, vocabulary, structure for meetings, stand-up meetings, things like that, speaking and fluency.</p>
<p id="p-53">A lot of this is going to be happening inside this course and learning more about socializing and small talk, how we can get to know our colleagues.</p>
<p id="p-54">We've got everything that we need in there, Aubrey, but what should our listeners do to get kind of an edge, to make sure they get the access at the beginning, they get the access right away to this course as soon as it's available?</p>
<p id="p-55">Yes, you want to get on the list and we will notify you as soon as this course is finished and ready.</p>
<p id="p-56">Spoiler, it's a very soon.</p>
<p id="p-57">So get on the list, allearsenglish.com slash professional.</p>
<p id="p-58">Yes, I'm so excited for our listeners to dive into our leveled professional series.</p>
<p id="p-59">It's going to be fantastic.</p>
<p id="p-60">So Aubrey, shall we let our listeners know what the question is for today?</p>
<p id="p-61">Yes, this is a question on YouTube.</p>
<h2>Part-06</h2>
<p id="p-62">This was a question on YouTube.</p>
<p id="p-63">It was from YTWN1VG.</p>
<p id="p-64">All of our YouTube social media names are often not our name.</p>
<p id="p-65">And the question was, what is the difference between every single day and every day?</p>
<p id="p-66">Ooh, a great question.</p>
<p id="p-67">It's a great question.</p>
<p id="p-68">And important to start at this level, B2, C1, we're starting to articulate this.</p>
<p id="p-69">Like when you asked me that question, you do that every single day?</p>
<p id="p-70">I stopped and I was thinking, do I do it every single day?</p>
<p id="p-71">Yes, I do.</p>
<p id="p-72">Right?</p>
<p id="p-73">It's a different question in a way.</p>
<p id="p-74">It's furthering the conversation, kind of.</p>
<p id="p-75">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-76">So we're going to dive into both of these today with lots of examples.</p>
<p id="p-77">And we're also adding the adjective every day, which is written slightly different, has a different meaning that we also use in English.</p>
<p id="p-78">And we're also sharing a fun, interesting culture note about American culture and that word.</p>
<p id="p-79">We've got a lot of good stuff for today.</p>
<p id="p-80">So let's get right into it.</p>
<p id="p-81">So when we separate, when we say every day and it's two words.</p>
<h2>Part-07</h2>
<p id="p-82">day, and it's two words.</p>
<p id="p-83">It's the adjective and noun.</p>
<p id="p-84">What are the scenarios here, Aubrey?</p>
<p id="p-85">This just means each day.</p>
<p id="p-86">So for example, I have to do laundry every day or it really piles up.</p>
<p id="p-87">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-88">Or every day I try to do some kind of exercise.</p>
<p id="p-89">Yes, Every day you take Kiefer for a walk, right?</p>
<p id="p-90">There are a lot of things that we do every day.</p>
<p id="p-91">But what is really tricky is the second option.</p>
<p id="p-92">We have the adjective every day that is written as one word and it means common, ordinary routine or common, ordinary or routine.</p>
<p id="p-93">So for example, if you're going dress shopping, you might say, this is kind of an ordinary everyday dress.</p>
<p id="p-94">I'm looking for something chic, something special.</p>
<p id="p-95">So here it doesn't mean each day, it means common, not unique.</p>
<p id="p-96">Yes, an everyday dress.</p>
<p id="p-97">And you know, to be honest, a lot of native speakers make the mistake and they'll write everyday dress as two words.</p>
<h2>Part-08</h2>
<p id="p-98">day dress as two words, they treat it the same way.</p>
<p id="p-99">Often they don't know that it's brought together as one word.</p>
<p id="p-100">That's a common native speaker spelling mistake.</p>
<p id="p-101">Absolutely, right?</p>
<p id="p-102">They realize when they're saying it that it has a different meaning, but they might not realize that it's written slightly differently.</p>
<p id="p-103">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-104">So by knowing this, guys, you'll be ahead of the game.</p>
<p id="p-105">Ahead of probably 50 or 60% of native speakers.</p>
<p id="p-106">Right?</p>
<p id="p-107">Maybe more.</p>
<p id="p-108">That's awesome.</p>
<p id="p-109">Oh my gosh.</p>
<p id="p-110">And we want to share a fun culture note here.</p>
<p id="p-111">This word, every day, sometimes you'll hear the phrase everyday people, which just means like normal, average people, common people, right?</p>
<p id="p-112">And it was a very famous song that was written in 1968 and performed by Sly and the Family Stone.</p>
<p id="p-113">You probably have heard this song, but the lyrics were actually really powerful, especially at the time in 1968 in the US.</p>
<p id="p-114">There was a lot of discrimination, a lot of racism, and these lyrics were a very powerful message.</p>
<p id="p-115">Some of the words, it says, I am</p>
<h2>Part-09</h2>
<p id="p-116">some of the where it says I am everyday people.</p>
<p id="p-117">So to use it in that way, right?</p>
<p id="p-118">Not saying we, we are everyday people say I am everyday people.</p>
<p id="p-119">And it was saying like I'm no better than you and neither are you.</p>
<p id="p-120">We are the same, whatever we do.</p>
<p id="p-121">It was a message against discrimination and racism.</p>
<p id="p-122">Interesting.</p>
<p id="p-123">Yeah, I never knew kind of where that song came from or the backstory behind it.</p>
<p id="p-124">So it's kind of cool to know this, Aubrey.</p>
<p id="p-125">I know, I didn't really either.</p>
<p id="p-126">I hadn't thought about it.</p>
<p id="p-127">I've heard this song a million times.</p>
<p id="p-128">And then when I was looking up like, you know, what are some of the interesting ways we use everyday, you know, besides just everyday dress, everyday clothing.</p>
<p id="p-129">And not only that, the bridges of the song contain the line different strokes for different folks.</p>
<p id="p-130">And that lyric has become a popular catchphrase.</p>
<p id="p-131">I still hear it now.</p>
<p id="p-132">I'll hear people say that if people disagree, it's another way to say agree to disagree just to say different strokes for different folks.</p>
<p id="p-133">And often people will just say different strokes, right?</p>
<p id="p-134">We shortened those expressions.</p>
<p id="p-135">Different strokes.</p>
<h2>Part-10</h2>
<p id="p-136">Yes, those expressions, different strokes.</p>
<p id="p-137">And then there was that TV show.</p>
<p id="p-138">And when did that TV show come out?</p>
<p id="p-139">Did it come out in 1969 or was it later?</p>
<p id="p-140">Do you know?</p>
<p id="p-141">It was a little bit later, but this catchphrase, it did inspire the television series Different Strokes.</p>
<p id="p-142">I believe it came out in the 70s.</p>
<p id="p-143">Did you ever watch that show?</p>
<p id="p-144">I haven't, no, but I think I know.</p>
<p id="p-145">You'll have to check it out.</p>
<p id="p-146">Yeah, I think it's fun for our listeners to see it.</p>
<p id="p-147">It really is an interesting window into US culture and kind of awesome that it inspired that show.</p>
<p id="p-148">Yeah, it's really cool to start with music, music from a certain time period, then look at the lyrics and go backward of what was happening in the US at that time or the world, then learn key vocabulary.</p>
<p id="p-149">Very cool.</p>
<p id="p-150">Yeah, and awesome to see what vocabulary it inspired that is now part of our vernacular.</p>
<p id="p-151">You'll hear it pretty often.</p>
<p id="p-152">Amazing.</p>
<p id="p-153">Okay, so that is just a little culture note.</p>
<p id="p-154">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-155">Do we want to move on to when we say every single day?</p>
<p id="p-156">I mean, when you said that to me, I questioned whether I was, am I telling the truth here?</p>
<p id="p-157">Yes, I do.</p>
<p id="p-158">He has to go to the bathroom.</p>
<h2>Part-11</h2>
<p id="p-159">Yes, I do.</p>
<p id="p-160">He has to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p id="p-161">Because this is emphasizing or expressing either surprise that something happens every day or just emphasizing that it does happen every single day, right?</p>
<p id="p-162">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p id="p-163">So, for example, every single day I have to do laundry or it will pile up.</p>
<p id="p-164">Oh, gosh.</p>
<p id="p-165">Yeah, and this is the same example I used with every day.</p>
<p id="p-166">But if I'm wanting to emphasize that I cannot miss a day, then I would say every single day I have to do laundry.</p>
<p id="p-167">Yeah, Or do you check the mail every single day?</p>
<p id="p-168">I check mine maybe once a week.</p>
<p id="p-169">Yeah, Wow.</p>
<p id="p-170">Yeah, and the intonation is interesting.</p>
<p id="p-171">You can just be like, do you check your mail every single day?</p>
<p id="p-172">But we often will emphasize with our intonation as well.</p>
<p id="p-173">Like, do you check the mail every single day?</p>
<p id="p-174">Sort of slow down to emphasize.</p>
<p id="p-175">And that's when people, yeah, they think a bit more, right?</p>
<p id="p-176">Do you do that every single day, right?</p>
<p id="p-177">This idea of exercising, maybe lifting weights or something, taking a vitamin.</p>
<h2>Part-12</h2>
<p id="p-178">something, taking a vitamin, those are things, right?</p>
<p id="p-179">I'm curious about this for you actually.</p>
<p id="p-180">I check my mail maybe even once every other week, once a month.</p>
<p id="p-181">Are you serious?</p>
<p id="p-182">Once a month you check your mail?</p>
<p id="p-183">I check my mail every day for sure.</p>
<p id="p-184">Oh yeah.</p>
<p id="p-185">Because we just don't get much in the mail that I need, right?</p>
<p id="p-186">All bills are online.</p>
<p id="p-187">I don't get like letters.</p>
<p id="p-188">It's just junk mail.</p>
<p id="p-189">So sometimes I'll actually get a notice from the post office.</p>
<p id="p-190">It's like you have to pick up your mail at the post office because your mailbox was too full and we couldn't fit anything else in there.</p>
<p id="p-191">That's so funny.</p>
<p id="p-192">I try to not do that at least.</p>
<p id="p-193">That's a huge inconvenience for them.</p>
<p id="p-194">I don't know.</p>
<p id="p-195">Maybe I'm old school.</p>
<p id="p-196">I still get excited about checking the mail.</p>
<p id="p-197">It's right outside of our door.</p>
<p id="p-198">It's like so easy.</p>
<p id="p-199">Maybe that's the difference.</p>
<p id="p-200">It helps ours down the street.</p>
<p id="p-201">That's funny.</p>
<p id="p-202">I don't remember that.</p>
<p id="p-203">Yeah, no, I love checking the mail.</p>
<p id="p-204">It's fun.</p>
<p id="p-205">What's going to be there, right?</p>
<p id="p-206">It's a little present, hopefully, if you ever get anything good.</p>
<p id="p-207">Right, All right.</p>
<p id="p-208">Okay, Aubrey, we're back for a role play.</p>
<p id="p-209">So here we're at...</p>
<h2>Part-13</h2>
<p id="p-210">role play.</p>
<p id="p-211">So here we're at a dog park.</p>
<p id="p-212">Makes sense.</p>
<p id="p-213">Makes sense.</p>
<p id="p-214">All right.</p>
<p id="p-215">You want to start us out?</p>
<p id="p-216">Yeah, Hey, fancy seeing you here.</p>
<p id="p-217">Hi, I love this park.</p>
<p id="p-218">Do you come here often?</p>
<p id="p-219">I bring Kiefer every day and I don't think we've ever seen you.</p>
<p id="p-220">Yeah, well, I don't come every single day, but pretty often.</p>
<p id="p-221">I don't have a dog, but I like to come and watch them play.</p>
<p id="p-222">I get it.</p>
<p id="p-223">Dogs have so much joy and energy.</p>
<p id="p-224">It's a fun everyday activity to just walk over here and hang out.</p>
<p id="p-225">Yeah, sometimes it's a little creepy.</p>
<p id="p-226">It's a little creepy when we're in a dog park.</p>
<p id="p-227">It's a little creepy.</p>
<p id="p-228">Sometimes we'll realize there's someone in the dog park that doesn't have a dog.</p>
<p id="p-229">We're like, is this a dog napper?</p>
<p id="p-230">What's happening here?</p>
<p id="p-231">I can see that.</p>
<p id="p-232">I'm envisioning because where I live, a lot of the dog parks are right by a kid's playground.</p>
<p id="p-233">So like I've taken my kids to the playground and they're old enough.</p>
<p id="p-234">I don't really need to supervise them.</p>
<p id="p-235">So I'll like watch the dogs playing.</p>
<p id="p-236">But on your side, though, I totally understand that.</p>
<p id="p-237">There's nothing more joyful than watching dogs play.</p>
<h2>Part-14</h2>
<p id="p-238">than watching dogs play.</p>
<p id="p-239">So I legitimate... But that would be kind of creepy to just be like hanging out in the dog park without a dog.</p>
<p id="p-240">If you're like the dog mom, you're like, what are you doing here?</p>
<p id="p-241">Don't steal my dog.</p>
<p id="p-242">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-243">All right, this is good.</p>
<p id="p-244">So I said, hey, do you come here often?</p>
<p id="p-245">I bring Kiefer every day and I don't think we've ever seen you.</p>
<p id="p-246">And I love how I'm saying we because I'm talking from the perspective of me and my dog.</p>
<p id="p-247">Love that.</p>
<p id="p-248">I think you would say that, right?</p>
<p id="p-249">I would actually.</p>
<p id="p-250">We come here every day, me and my dog.</p>
<p id="p-251">I probably would.</p>
<p id="p-252">And then what did you say?</p>
<p id="p-253">I said, well, I don't come every single day.</p>
<p id="p-254">So because you're saying I come every day, I'm sort of trying to emphasize like I come most days, but not every single day.</p>
<p id="p-255">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-256">Love it.</p>
<p id="p-257">And again, slowing down.</p>
<p id="p-258">Well, I don't come every single day, right?</p>
<p id="p-259">The intonation, the delivery feels different, right?</p>
<p id="p-260">Exactly.</p>
<p id="p-261">And it's interesting to look at why you would maybe have said every day.</p>
<p id="p-262">Like you often will say every day when maybe we actually do that four or five times a week, max, right?</p>
<h2>Part-15</h2>
<p id="p-263">four or five times a week, max, right?</p>
<p id="p-264">We don't really mean every single day sometimes when we say every day.</p>
<p id="p-265">Yeah, I think the minimum would be four to five times a week to say every day, right?</p>
<p id="p-266">You're not going to say if you do something once a week, you wouldn't say I do this every day.</p>
<p id="p-267">Or even two or three.</p>
<p id="p-268">But if it's four or five, you cross over into pretty much every day, right?</p>
<p id="p-269">We're exaggerating.</p>
<p id="p-270">We love to exaggerate.</p>
<p id="p-271">Oh yeah, big thing in American English.</p>
<p id="p-272">And then I said, I get it.</p>
<p id="p-273">Dogs have so much joy and energy.</p>
<p id="p-274">Isn't that true, right?</p>
<p id="p-275">It's a fun everyday activity.</p>
<p id="p-276">And here we're using this as an adjective and we're making one word, everyday.</p>
<p id="p-277">Yeah, written as one word, everyday.</p>
<p id="p-278">And here it means common, just like a routine activity, an everyday activity, something you do all the time.</p>
<p id="p-279">Yeah, and important to note the difference in intonation when I have it as two words versus an adjective with one word.</p>
<p id="p-280">I bring Kiefer every day, right?</p>
<p id="p-281">Versus it's a fun everyday activity.</p>
<p id="p-282">Every day.</p>
<p id="p-283">It's true, we squish them together more.</p>
<p id="p-284">It would be very strange.</p>
<h2>Part-16</h2>
<p id="p-285">them together more.</p>
<p id="p-286">It would be very strange here to pause to say it's a fun everyday activity because it's one word, there's no space between them, so we run it together more.</p>
<p id="p-287">Yeah, and like we said earlier, if you can master just this piece about everyday as an adjective in one word, you'll be ahead of at least 50% of native speakers, okay?</p>
<p id="p-288">At least when it comes to writing.</p>
<p id="p-289">Yeah, Yes, and luckily, you know, it's not written very often, which is why a lot of native English speakers don't realize that, they don't see it written very much, right?</p>
<p id="p-290">It's true.</p>
